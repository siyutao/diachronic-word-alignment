So they and their children had the ouersight of the gates of the house of the Lord , namely , the house of the Tabernacle , by wards .
In foure quarters were the porters : toward the East , West , North , and South .
And their brethren , which were in their villages , were to come after seuen dayes , from time to time with them .

Nowe the Philistines fought against Israel , and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell downe slaine in mount Gilboa .
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul , and after his sonnes , and the Philistines slew Ionathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sonnes of Saul .
And the battell went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him , and he was wounded of the archers .
Then saide Saul to his armour bearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith , lest these vncircumcised come , and abuse mee : but his armour bearer would not , for he was sore afraid . So Saul tooke a sword , and fell vpon it .
And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead , hee fell likewise on the sword , and died .
So Saul died , and his three sonnes , and all his house died together .
And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley , saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sonnes were dead : then they forsooke their cities , and fled , and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
¶ And it came to passe on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slaine , that they found Saul and his sonnes fallen in mount Gilboa .
And when they had stripped him , they tooke his head , and his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to cary tidings vnto their idoles , and to the people .
And they put his armour in the house of their gods , and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon .
¶ And when all Iabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul :
They arose , all the valiant men , and tooke away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sonnes , and brought them to Iabesh , and buried their bones vnder the oke in Iabesh , and fasted seuen dayes .
¶ So Saul died for his transgression which hee committed against the Lord , euen against the word of the Lord which he kept not , and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit , to enquire of it :

Then all Israel gathered themselues to Dauid vnHebron , saying , Behold , wee are thy bone and thy flesh .
And moreouer in time past , euen when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord thy God said vnto thee , Thou shalt feede my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler ouer my people Israel .
Therefore came all the Elders of Israel to the king to Hebron , and Dauid made a couenant with them in Hebron before the Lord , and they annointed Dauid king ouer Israel , according to the word of the Lord , by Samuel .
¶ And Dauid & all Israel , went to Ierusalem , which is Iebus , where the Iebusites were the inhabitants of the land .
And the inhabitants of Iebus said to Dauid , Thou shalt not come hither . Neuerthelesse Dauid tooke the castle of Zion , which is the citie of Dauid .
And Dauid said , Whosoeuer smiteth the Iebusites first , shall be chiefe , and captaine . So Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah went first vp , and was chiefe .
And Dauid dwelt in the castell : therefore they called it the citie of Dauid .
And he built the citie round about , euen from Millo round about : and Ioab repaired the rest of the citie .
So Dauid waxed greater and greater : for the Lord of hostes was with him .
¶ These also are the chiefe of the mightie men , whom Dauid had , who strenthened themselues with him in his kingdome , and with all Israel , to make him king according to the word of the Lord , concerning Israel .
And this is the number of the mightie men , whom Dauid had : Iashobeam an Hachmonite , the chiefe of the captaines : he lift vp his speare against three hundred , slaine by him at one time .
And after him was Eleazar the sonne of Dodo the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighties .
He was with Dauid at Pasdammim ; and there the Philistines were gathered together to battell , where was a parcell of ground full of barley , and the people fled from before the Philistines .
And they set themselues in the middest of that parcell , and deliuered it , and slue the Philistines , & the Lord saued them by a great deliuerance .
¶ Now three of the thirtie captaines , went downe to the rocke of Dauid , into the caue of Adullam , and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
And Dauid was then in the hold , and the Philistines garison was then at Bethlehem .
And Dauid longed and said , Oh that one would giue me drinke of the water of the well of Bethlehem , that is at the gate .
And the three brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and tooke it and brought it to Dauid . But Dauid would not drink of it , but powred it out to the Lord ,
And said , My God forbid it mee , that I should doe this thing . Shall I drinke the blood of these men , that haue put their liues in ieopardie ? for with the ieopardie of their liues , they brought it : therfore he would not drink it . These things did these three mightiest .
¶ And Abishai the brother of Ioab , he was chiefe of the three . For lifting vp his speare against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
Of the three , hee was more honourable then the two , for he was their captaine ; howbeit , he attained not to the first three .
Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , the sonne of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts : he slue two Lyon - like men of Moab , also he went downe and slue a Lyon in a pit in a snowy day .
And he slue an Egyptian , a man of great stature , fiue cubits high , and in the Egyptians hand was a speare like a weauers beame : and he went downe to him with a staffe , and pluckt the speare out of the Egyptians hand , and slue him with his owne speare .
These things did Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and had the name among the three mighties .
Behold , hee was honourable among the thirtie , but attained not to the first three : and Dauid set him ouer his guard .
¶ Also the valiant men of the armies were Asahel the brother of Ioab , Elhanan the sonne of Dodo of Bethlehem . Shammoth the Harorite , Helez the Pelonite ,

Now these are they that came to Dauid to Ziklag while hee yet kept himselfe close , because of Saul the sonne of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the warre .
They were armed with bowes , and could vse both the right hand and the left , in hurling stones , and shooting arrowes out of a bow , euen of Sauls brethren of Beniamin .
The chiefe was Ahiezer , then Ioash the sonnes of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Ieziel , and Pelet , the sonnes of Azmaueth , and Berachah , and Iehu the Antothite ,

And Ioelah , and Zebadiah the sonnes of Ieroam of Gedor .
And of the Gadites there separated themselues vnto Dauid , into the hold to the wildernesse , men of might , and men of warre , fit for the battel , that could handle shield and buckler , whose faces were like the faces of Lyons , and were as swift as the Roes vpon the mountaines :
Ezer the first , Obadiah the second , Eliab the third , Mashmannah the fourth , Ieremiah the fift ,
Atthai the sixt , Eliel the seuenth , Iohanan the eighth , Elzabad the ninth ,
Ieremiah the tenth , Machbanai the eleuenth .
These were of the sonnes of Gad , captaines of the hoste : one of the least was ouer an hundred , and the greatest , ouer a thousand .
These are they that went ouer Iorden in the first moneth , when it had ouerflowen all his bankes , and they put to flight all them of the valleis , both toward the East , and toward the West .
And there came of the children of Beniamin , and Iudah , to the hold vnto Dauid .
And Dauid went out to meete them , and answered and sayd vnto them : If yee bee come peaceably vnto me to helpe me , mine heart shall be knit vnto you : but if yee be come to betray me to mine enemies , seeing there is no wrong in mine hands : the God of our fathers looke thereon , and rebuke it .
Then the spirit came vpon Amasai , who was chiefe of the captaines , and he sayd , Thine are we , Dauid , and on thy side , thou sonne of Iesse : Peace , peace be vnto thee , and peace be to thine helpers ; for thy God helpeth thee . Then Dauid receiued them , and made them captaines of the band .
And there fell some of Manasseh to Dauid , when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battell , but they helped them not . For the Lords of the Philistines , vpon aduisement , sent him away , saying , Hee will fall to his master Saul , to the ieopardie of our heads .
As he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Iozabad , and Iediel , and Michael , and Iozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captaines of the thousands that were of Manasseh .
And they helped Dauid against the band of the Rouers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captaines in the hoste .
And Iehoiada was the leader of the Aaronits , and with him were three thousand , and seuen hundred .
And Zadok a young man mightie of valour , and of his fathers house twentie and two captaines .
And of the children of Beniamin the kinred of Saul three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul .
And of the children of Ephraim , twentie thousand , and eight hundred , mightie men of valour , famous throughout the house of their fathers .
And of the halfe tribe of Manasseh , eighteene thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make Dauid king .
And of the children of Issachar , which were men that had vnderstanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to doe : the heads of them were two hundred , and all their brethren were at their commandement .
Of Zebulun , such as went foorth to battell , expert in warre , with all instruments of warre , fifty thousand , which could keepe ranke : They were not of double heart . And of Naphtali a thousand captaines , and with them , with shield and speare , thirtie and seuen thousand .
And of the Danites , expert in war , twentie and eight thousand , and sixe hundred . And of Asher , such as went foorth to battell , expert in warre , fourtie thousand .
And on the other side of Iorden , of the Reubenites , & the Gadites , and of the halfe tribe of Manasseh , with all maner of instruments of warre for the battell , an hundred and twentie thousand .
All these men of warre , that could keepe ranke , came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make Dauid king ouer all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel , were of one heart to make Dauid king .
And there they were with Dauid three dayes , eating and drinking : for their brethren had prepared for them .
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid consulted with the captaines of thousands , and hundreds , and with euery leader .
And Dauid said vnto all the Congregation of Israel , If it seeme good vnto you , and that it be of the Lord our God , let vs send abroad vnto our brethren euery where , that are left in all the land of Israel , and with them also to the Priests and Leuites which are in their cities and suburbs , that they may gather themselues vnto vs .
And let vs bring againe the Arke of our God to vs : for wee enquired not at it in the dayes of Saul .
And all the Congregation saide , that they would doe so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
So Dauid gathered all Israel together , from Shihor of Egypt , euen vnto the entring of Hemath , to bring the Arke of God from Kiriath - iearim .
And Dauid went vp , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kiriath - iearim , which belonged to Iudah , to bring vp thence the Arke of God the Lord , that dwelleth betweene the Cherubims , whose name is called on it .
And they caried the Arke of God in a new cart , out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza , and Ahio draue the cart .
And Dauid and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing , and with harpes , and with psalteries , and with tymbrels , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
¶ And when they came vnto the threshing floore of Chidon , Uzza put foorth his hand to hold the Arke , for the oxen stumbled .
And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza , and hee smote him , because hee put his hand to the Arke : and there he died before God .
And Dauid was displeased , because the Lord had made a breach vpon Uzza ; wherefore that place is called Perez - Uzza , to this day .
And Dauid was afraide of God that day , saying , How shall I bring the Arke of God home to me ?
So Dauid brought not the Arke home to himselfe to the city of Dauid , but caried it aside into the house of Obed - Edom the Gittite .
<NON-VERSE>
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid , and timber of Cedars , with masons , and carpenters to build him an house .
And Dauid perceiued that the Lord had confirmed him king ouer Israel , for his kingdome was lift vp on high , because of his people Israel .
¶ And Dauid tooke moe wiues at Ierusalem : and Dauid begate moe sonnes and daughters .
Now these are the names of his children which hee had in Ierusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon , And Ibhar , and Elishua , and Elpalet ,
And Noga , and Nepheg , and Iaphia ,
And Elishama , and Beeliada , and Elpalet .
¶ And when the Philistines heard that Dauid was anoynted king ouer all Israel , all the Philistines went vp to seeke Dauid : and Dauid heard of it , and went out against them .
And the Philistines came & spread themselues in the valley of Rephaim .
And Dauid enquired of God , saying , Shall I goe vp against the Philistines ? and wilt thou deliuer them into mine hand ? And the Lord said vnto him , Go vp , for I will deliuer them into thine hand .
So they came vp to Baal - Perazim , and Dauid smote them there . Then Dauid said , God hath broken in vpon mine enemies by mine hand , like the breaking foorth of waters : therefore they called the name of that place , Baal - Perazim .
And when they had left their gods there , Dauid gaue a commandement , and they were burnt with fire .
And the Philistines yet againe spread themselues abroad in the valley .
Therfore Dauid enquired againe of God , and God said vnto him , Goe not vp after them , turne away from them , and come vpon them ouer against the mulbery trees .
And it shall bee , when thou shalt heare a sound of going in the tops of the mulbery trees , that then thou shalt goe out to battaile : for God is gone foorth before thee , to smite the hoste of the Philistines .
Dauid therefore did as God commanded him : and they smote the hoste of the Philistines from Gibeon euen to Gazer .
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid made him houses in the citie of Dauid , and prepared a place for the Arke of God , and pitched for it a tent .
Then Dauid sayd , None ought to carie the Arke of God , but the Leuites : for them hath the Lord chosen to cary the Arke of God , and to minister vnto him for euer .
And Dauid gathered all Israel together to Ierusalem , to bring vp the Arke of the Lord vnto his place , which hee had prepared for it .
Of the sonnes of Merari : Asaiah the chiefe , and his brethren two hundred and twentie .
Of the sonnes of Gershom : Ioel the chiefe , and his brethren an hundred and thirtie .
Of the sonnes of Elizaphan : Shemaiah the chiefe , and his brethren two hundred .
Of the sonnes of Hebron : Eliel the chiefe , and his brethren fourescore .
Of the sonnes of Uzziel : Amminadab the chiefe , and his brethren an hundred and twelue .
And Dauid called for Zadok and Abiathar the Priests , and for the Leuites , for Uriel , Asaiah and Ioel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab ,
And said vnto them , Yee are the chiefe of the fathers of the Leuites : sanctifie your selues both yee and your brethren , that you may bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Israel , vnto the place that I haue prepared for it .
For because ye did it not at the first , the Lord our God made a breach vpon vs , for that we sought him not after the due order .
So the Priestes and the Leuites sanctified themselues to bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Israel .
And the children of the Leuites bare the Arke of God vpon their shoulders , with the staues thereon , as Moses commanded , according to the word of the Lord .
And Dauid spake to the chiefe of the Leuites , to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musicke , Psalteries , and Harpes , and Cymbales , sounding , by lifting vp the voice with ioy .
So the Leuites appointed Heman the sonne of Ioel : and of his brethren . Asaph the sonne of Berechiah : and of the sonnes of Merari their brethren , Ethan the sonne of Kushaiah .
And with them their brethren of the second degree , Zachariah , Ben , and Iaziel , & Shemiramoth , and Iehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maasiah , and Mattithiah , and Eliphaleh , and Mikniah , and Obed Edom , and Iehiel the Porters .
So the Singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were appointed to sound with cymbales of brasse .
And Zachariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Iehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maasiah , and Benaiah , with Psalteries on Alamoth .
And Mattithiah , and Eliphaleh , and Mikniah , and Obed Edom , and Ieiel , and Azzaziah , with harpes on the Sheminith to excell .
And Chenaniah chiefe of the Leuites was for song : he instructed about the song , because he was skilfull .
And Berechiah , and Elkanah were doore keepers for the Arke .
And Shebaniah , and Iehoshaphat , and Nathaneel , and Amasai , and Zachariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer the priests , did blow with the trumpets before the Arke of God : and Obed Edom , and Iehiah were doore keepers for the Arke .
¶ So Dauid and the Elders of Israel , and the captaines ouer thousands , went to bring vp the Arke of the couenant of the Lord , out of the house of Obed Edom with ioy .
And it came to passe when God helped the Leuites that bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord , that they offered seuen bullocks , and seuen rammes .
And Dauid was clothed with a robe of fine linnen , and all the Leuites that bare the Arke , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song , with the singers . Dauid also had vpon him , an Ephod of linnen .
Thus all Israel brought vp the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , making a noise with psalteries and harpes .
<NON-VERSE> So they brought the Arke of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that Dauid had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices , and peace offerings before God .
And when Dauid had made an end of offering the burnt offerings , and the peace offrings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord .
And hee dealt to euery one of Israel , both man and woman , to euery one a loafe of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
¶ And he appointed certaine of the Leuites to minister before the Arke of the Lord , and to record , and to thanke and praise the Lord God of Israel ,
Asaph the chiefe , and next to him Zachariah , Ieiel , and Shemiramoth , and Iehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed Edom : and Ieiel with Psalteries and with harpes : but Asaph made a sound with cymbals .
Benaiah also and Iahaziel the Priestes , with trumpets continually before the Arke of the Couenant of God .
¶ Then on that day , Dauid deliuered first this Psalme to thanke the Lord , into the hand of Asaph and his brethren :
Giue thankes vnto the Lord , call vpon his name , make knowen his deeds among the people .
Sing vnto him , sing psalmes vnto him , talke you of all his wonderous workes .
Glory yee in his holy Name , let the heart of them reioyce that seeke the Lord .
Seeke the Lord , and his strength , seeke his face continually .
Remember his marueilous works that he hath done , his wonders , and the iudgements of his mouth ,
O ye seed of Israel his seruant , ye children of Iacob his chosen ones .
And hath confirmed the same to Iacob for a lawe , and to Israel for an euerlasting Couenant ,
Saying , vnto thee will I giue the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance .
When ye were but few , euen a few , and strangers in it :
And when they went from nation to nation , and from one kingdome to another people :
Hee suffered no man to doe them wrong : yea , hee reprooued kings for their sakes ,
Saying , Touch not mine anointed , and doe my Prophets no harme .
Sing vnto the Lord all the earth : shew foorth from day to day his saluation .
Declare his glory among the heathen : his marueilous workes among all nations .
For great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised : he also is to be feared aboue all gods .
For all the gods of the people are idoles : but the Lord made the heauens .
Glory and honour are in his presence : strength and gladnesse are in his place .
Giue vnto the Lord , yee kinreds of the people : giue vnto the Lord glory and strength .
Giue vnto the Lord the glory due vnto his Name : bring an offering , and come before him , worship the Lord in the beautie of holinesse .
Feare before him all the earth : the world also shall be stable , that it be not mooued .
Let the heauens be glad , and let the earth reioyce : and let men say among the nations , The Lord reigneth .
Let the sea roare , and the fulnesse thereof : let the fieldes reioyce , and all that is therein .
Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord , because hee commeth to iudge the earth .
O giue thanks vnto the Lord , for hee is good : for his mercy endureth for euer .
And say yee , Saue vs , O God of our saluation , and gather vs together , and deliuer vs from the heathen , that we may giue thanks to thy holy Name , and glory in thy praise .
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for euer and euer : and all the people saide , Amen , and praised the Lord .
¶ So hee left there before the Arke of the couenant of the Lord , Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the Arke continually , as euery dayes worke required :
And Obed Edom with their brethren , threescore and eight : Obed Edom also the sonne of Ieduthun , and Hosah to be porters :
And Zadok the Priest , and his brethren the Priests , before the Tabernacle of the Lord , in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
To offer burnt offerings vnto the Lord , vpon the Altar of the burnt offering continually morning and euening , and to doe according to all that is written in the Lawe of the Lord , which hee commanded Israel :
And with them Heman and Ieduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to giue thankes to the Lord , because his mercy endureth for euer .
And with them Heman and Ieduthun with trumpets and cymbales , for those that should make a sound , and with musicall instruments of God : and the sonnes of Ieduthun were Porters .

Now it came to passe , as Dauid sate in his house , that Dauid sayde to Nathan the Prophet , Loe , I dwell in an house of Cedars , but the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord remaineth vnder curtaines .
Then Nathan sayd vnto Dauid , Doe all that is in thine heart , for God is with thee .
¶ And it came to passe the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
Goe and tell Dauid my seruant , Thus saith the Lord , Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in .
For I haue not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought vp Israel , vnto this day , but haue gone from tent to tent , and from one Tabernacle to another .
Wheresoeuer I haue walked with all Israel , spake I a word to any of the Iudges of Israel ( whom I commanded to feed my people ) saying , Why haue ye not built me an house of Cedars ?
Now therefore thus shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I tooke thee from the Sheep - coat , euen from folowing the sheep , that thou shouldest be ruler ouer my people Israel :
And I haue bene with thee whithersoeuer thou hast walked , and haue cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and haue made thee a name , like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
Also I will ordeine a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , and they shall dwell in their place , and shall be moued no more : neither shal the children of wickednesse waste them any more ( as at the beginning ,
And since the time that I commanded Iudges to bee ouer my people Israel . ) Moreouer , I will subdue all thine enemies . Furthermore I tel thee , that the Lord will build thee an house .
¶ And it shall come to passe , when thy dayes be expired , that thou must go to be with thy fathers , that I will raise vp thy seed after thee , which shall bee of thy sonnes , and I wil stablish his kingdome .
He shall build me an house , and I will stablish his throne for euer .
I will be his father , and he shall be my sonne , and I will not take my mercie away from him , as I tooke it from him that was before thee .
But I will settle him in mine house , and in my kingdom for euer , and his throne shall bee established for euermore .
According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speake vnto Dauid .
¶ And Dauid the king came , and sate before the Lord , and said , Who am I , O Lord God , and what is mine house , that thou hast brought mee hitherto ?
And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God : for thou hast also spoken of thy seruants house , for a great while to come , and hast regarded mee according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
What can Dauid speake more to thee for the honour of thy seruant ? for thou knowest thy seruant .
O Lord , for thy seruants sake , and according to thine owne heart , hast thou done all this greatnesse in making knowen all these great things .
O Lord , there is none like thee neither is there any God besides thee , according to all that we haue heard with our eares .
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel , whome God went to redeeme to be his owne people , to make thee a name of greatnesse and terriblenesse , by driuing out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt ?
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine owne people for euer , and thou , Lord , becamest their God .
Therefore now Lord , let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant , and concerning his house , be established for euer , and doe as thou hast said .
Let it euen bee established , that thy name may bee magnified for euer , saying , The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel , euen a God to Israel : and let the house of Dauid thy seruant be established before thee .
For thou , O my God , hast tolde thy seruant that thou wilt build him an house : therefore thy seruant hath found in his heart to pray before thee .
And now , Lord ( thou art God , and hast promised this goodnesse vnto thy seruant . )

Now after this , it came to passe , that Dauid smote the Philistines & subdued them , and tooke Gath , and her townes out of the hand of the Philistines .
And he smote Moab , and the Moabites became Dauids seruants , and brought gifts .
¶ And Dauid smote Hadarezer king of Zobah vnto Hamath , as hee went to stablish his dominion by the riuer Euphrates .
And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets , and seuen thousand horsemen , and twentie thousand footmen : Dauid also houghed all the charet horses , but reserued of them an hundred charets .
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to helpe Hadarezer king of Zobah , Dauid slew of the Syrians two and twentie thousand men .
Then Dauid put garisons in Syria Damascus , and the Syrians became Dauids seruants , and brought giftes . Thus the Lord preserued Dauid , whithersoeuer he went .
And Dauid tooke the shields of golde that were on the seruants of Hadarezer , & brought them to Ierusalem .
Likewise from Tibhath , and from Chun , cities of Hadarezer , broght Dauid very much brasse , wherewith Solomon made the brasen Sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brasse .
¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how Dauid had smitten all the hoste of Hadarezer king of Zobah :
Hee sent Hadoram his sonne to king Dauid , to enquire of his welfare , and to congratulate him , because hee had fought against Hadarezer , and smitten him ( for Hadarezer had warre with Tou ) and with him all manner of vessels of golde and siluer , and brasse .
¶ Them also king Dauid dedicated vnto the Lord , with the siluer and the golde that he brought from all these nations : from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
Moreouer , Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah , slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt , eighteene thousand .
¶ And he put garisons in Edom , and all the Edomites became Dauids seruants . Thus the Lord preserued Dauid whithersoeuer he went .
¶ So Dauid reigned ouer all Israel , and executed iudgement and iustice among all his people .
And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the hoste , and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud , Recorder .
And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub , and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar , were the Priests , and Shausha was Scribe .
<NON-VERSE>
Now it came to passe after this , that Nahash the King of the children of Ammon dyed , & his sonne reigned in his stead .
And Dauid sayde , I will shewe kindnesse vnto Hanun the sonne of Nahash , because his father shewed kindnesse to mee . And Dauid sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father . So the seruants of Dauid came into the land of the children of Ammon , to Hanun , to comfort him .
But the Princes of the children of Ammon sayde to Hanun , Thinkest thou that Dauid doeth honour thy father , that he hath sent comforters vnto thee ? Are not his seruants come vnto thee for to search , and to ouerthrow , and to spie out the land ?
Wherefore Hanun tooke Dauids seruants , and shaued them , and cut off their garments in the middest , hard by their buttockes , and sent them away .
Then there went certeine , and told Dauid , how the men were serued , and hee sent to meet them ( for the men were greatly ashamed ) and the King sayde , Tary at Iericho vntill your beards be growen , and then returne .
¶ And when the children of Ammon sawe , that they had made themselues odious to Dauid ; Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of siluer , to hire them charets and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Syria - Maachah , and out of Zobah .
So they hired thirtie and two thousand charets , and the king of Maachah and his people , who came and pitched before Medeba . And the children of Ammon gathered themselues together from their cities , and came to battaile .
And when Dauid heard of it , hee sent Ioab , and all the host of the mightie men .
And the children of Ammon came out , and put the battell in aray before the gate of the citie , and the kings that were come , were by themselues in the field .
Now when Ioab saw that the battell was set against him , before and behinde : hee chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in aray against the Syrians .
And the rest of the people hee deliuered vnto the hand of Abishai his brother , and they set themselues in aray against the children of Ammon .
And he said , If the Syrians bee too strong for me , then thou shalt helpe me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I wil helpe thee .
Be of good courage , and let vs behaue our selues valiantly for our people , and for the Cities of our God : and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight .
So Ioab and the people that were with him , drew nigh before the Syrians , vnto the battell ; and they fled before him .
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entred into the city . Then Ioab came to Ierusalem .
¶ And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians , that were beyond the Riuer : and Shophach the captaine of the hoste of Hadarezer , went before them .
And it was tolde Dauid , and hee gathered all Israel , and passed ouer Iordane , and came vpon them , and set the battell in aray against them : so when Dauid had put the battell in aray against the Syrians , they fought with him .
But the Syrians fled before Israel , and Dauid slew of the Syrians seuen thousand men , which fought in charets , and fourty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captaine of the hoste .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , that after the yeere was expired , at the time that kings goe out to battell , Ioab led forth the power of the armie , and wasted the countrey of the children of Ammon , and came and besieged Rabbah ( but Dauid taried at Ierusalem , ) and Ioab smote Rabbah , and destroyed it .
And Dauid tooke the crowne of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it , and it was set vpon Dauids head ; and hee brought also exceeding much spoile out of the city .
And hee brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with sawes , and with harrowes of yron , and with axes : euen so dealt Dauid with all the cities of the children of Ammon . And Dauid and all the people returned to Ierusalem .
¶ And it came to passe after this , that there arose warre at Gezer with the Philistines , at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite , slew Sippai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were subdued .
And there was warre againe with the Philistines , and Elhanan the sonne of Iair , slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , whose spearestaffe was like a weauers beame .
And yet againe there was warre at Gath , where was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were foure and twentie , sixe on each hand , and sixe on each foot . And he also was the sonne of the giant .
But when he defied Israel , Ionathan the sonne of Shimea Dauids brother , slew him .
<NON-VERSE>
And Satan stoode vp against Israel , and prouoked Dauid to number Israel .
And Dauid saide to Ioab , and to the rulers of the people , Goe , number Israel from Beer - sheba eueu to Dan : and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
And Ioab answered , The Lord make his people an hundred times so many moe as they bee : but , my lord the king , are they not al my lords seruants ? why then doeth my lord require this thing ? why will hee bee a cause of trespasse to Israel ?
Neuerthelesse , the kings word preuailed against Ioab : wherefore Ioab departed , and went throughout all Israel , and came to Ierusalem .
¶ And Ioab gaue the summe of the number of the people vnto Dauid : and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand , and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Iudah was foure hundred threescore and ten thousand men , that drew sword .
But Leui and Beniamin counted hee not among them : for the kings word was abominable to Ioab .
And God was displeased with this thing , therefore he smote Israel .
And Dauid saide vnto God , I haue sinned greatly , because I haue done this thing : but uow , I beseech thee , doe away the iniquitie of thy seruant , for I haue done very foolishly .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Gad , Dauids Seer , saying ,
Goe and tell Dauid , saying , Thus saith the Lord , I offer thee three things , choose thee one of them , that I may doe it vnto thee .
So Gad came to Dauid , and said vnto him , Thus saith the Lord , Choose thee
Either three yeeres famine , or three moneths to bee destroyed before thy foes ( while that the sword of thine enemies ouertaketh thee ) or else three dayes the sword of the Lord , euen the pestilence in the land , and the Angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel . Now therefore aduise thy selfe , what word I shall bring againe to him that sent me .
And Dauid said vnto Gad , I am in a great strait . Let mee fall now into the hand of the Lord ( for very great are his mercies , ) but let me not fall into the hand of man .
¶ So the Lord sent pestilence vpon Israel : and there fell of Israel , seuentie thousand men .
And God sent an Angel vnto Ierusalem to destroy it : and as he was destroying , the Lord beheld , and he repented him of the euill , and said to the Angel that destroyed , It is ynough , stay now thine hand . And the Angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite .
And Dauid lift vp his eyes , and saw the Angel of the Lord stand betweene the earth and the heauen , hauing a drawen sword in his hand stretched out ouer Ierusalem . Then Dauid and the Elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackecloth , fell vpon their faces .
And Dauid said vnto God , Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbred ? euen I it is that haue sinned , and done euill indeed , but as for these sheepe , what haue they done ? Let thine hand , I pray thee , O Lord my God , be on me , and on my fathers house , but not on thy people , that they should bee plagued .
¶ Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid , that Dauid should goe vp and set vp an Altar vnto the Lord , in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite .
And Dauid went vp at the saying of Gad , which he spake in the Name of the Lord .
And Ornan turned backe and saw the Angel , and his foure sonnes with him , hid themselues . Now Ornan was threshing wheat .
And as Dauid came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw Dauid , and went out of the threshing floore , and bowed himselfe to Dauid with his face to the ground .
Then Dauid saide to Ornan , Grant mee the place of this threshing floore , that I may build an Altar therein vnto the Lord : thou shalt grant it mee for the full price , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
And Ornan saide vnto Dauid , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes . Loe , I giue thee the oxen also for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meate offering , I giue it all .
And king Dauid said to Ornan ; Nay , but I wil verily buy it for the full price : for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord , nor offer burnt offerings without cost .
So Dauid gaue to Ornan for the place , sixe hundred shekels of gold by weight .
And Dauid built there an Altar vnto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings , and peace offerings , and called vpon the Lord , and hee answered him from heauen by fire vpon the Altar of burnt offering .
And the Lord commaunded the Angel , and hee put vp his sword againe into the sheath thereof .
¶ At that time , when Dauid saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite , then he sacrificed there .
For the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wildernesse , and the Altar of the burnt offering were at that season , in the high place at Gibeon :
<NON-VERSE>
Then Dauid said , This is the house of the Lord God , and this is the Altar of the burnt offering for Israel .
And Dauid commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel : and hee set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
And Dauid prepared yron in abundance for the nailes for the doores of the gates , and for the ioynings , and brasse in abundance without weight ;
Also Cedar trees in abundance : for the Zidonians , and they of Tyre , brought much Cedar wood to Dauid .
And Dauid said , Solomon my sonne is yong and tender , and the house that is to be builded for the Lord , must be exceeding magnificall , of fame and of glory throughout all countreys : I will therefore now make preparation for it . So Dauid prepared abundantly before his death . ¶ Then hee called for Solomon his sonne , and charged him to build an house for the Lord God of Israel .
And Dauid saide to Solomon ; My sonne , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house vnto the Name of the Lord my God .
But the word of the Lord came to mee , saying , Thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great warres : thou shalt not build an house vnto my Name , because thou hast shed much blood vpon the earth in my sight .
Behold , a sonne shall bee borne to thee , who shall bee a man of rest , and I will giue him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shalbe Solomon , and I wil giue peace and quietnesse vnto Israel in his dayes .
Hee shall build an house for my Name , and he shal be my sonne , and I will be his father , and I will establish the throne of his kingdome ouer Israel for euer .
Now my sonne , The Lord be with thee , and prosper thou , and build the house of the Lord thy God , as he hath said of thee .
Onely the Lord giue thee wisedome and vnderstanding , and giue thee charge concerning Israel , that thou mayest keepe the Law of the Lord thy God .
Then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfill the Statutes and Iudgements which the Lord charged Moses with , concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage , dread not , nor be dismayed .
Now beholde , in my trouble I haue prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of siluer , and of brasse and yron without weight : ( for it is in abundance ) timber also and stone haue I prepared , and thou mayest adde thereto .
Moreouer , there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers , and workers of stone and timber , and all maner of cunning men for euery maner of worke :
Of the gold , the siluer , and the brasse , and the yron , there is no number . Arise therefore , and be doing , and the Lord be with thee .
¶ Dauid also commanded all the Princes of Israel to helpe Solomon his sonne , saying ,
Is not the Lord your God with you ? and hath he not giuen you rest on euery side ? for he hath giuen the inhabitants of the land into mine hand , and the land is subdued before the Lord , and before his people .
<NON-VERSE>
So when Dauid was old and full of dayes , he made Solomon his sonne king ouer Israel .
¶ And he gathered together all the Princes of Israel , with the Priests and the Leuites .
Now the Leuites were numbred from the age of thirtie yeeres and vpward : and their number , by their polles , man by man , was thirtie and eight thousand .
Of which , twentie and foure thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the Lord : and sixe thousand were Officers and Iudges .
Moreouer , foure thousand were porters , and foure thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which I made ( said Dauid ) to praise therewith .
The sonnes of Laadan , the chiefe was Iehiel , and Zetham , and Ioel , three .
The sonnes of Shimei : Shelomith , and Haziel , and Haran , three . These were the chiefe of the fathers of Laadan .
And the sonnes of Shimei were : Iahath , Zina , and Ieush , and Beriah . These foure were the sonnes of Shimei .
And Iahath was the chiefe , and Ziza the second : but Ieush and Beriah had not many sonnes : therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their fathers house .
¶ The sonnes of Kohath : Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , foure .
The sonnes of Amram : Aaron and Moses : and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctifie the most holy things , he and his sonnes for euer , to burne incense before the Lord , to minister vnto him , and to blesse in his Name for euer .
Now concerning Moses the man of God , his sonnes were named of the tribe of Leui . The sonnes of Moses were : Gershom and Eliezer .
Of the sonnes of Gershom Shebuel was the chiefe .
And the sonnes of Eliezer were : Rehabiah the chiefe . And Eliezer had none other sonnes : but the sonnes of Rehabiah were very many .
Of the sonnes of Izhar , Shelomith the chiefe .
Of the sonnes of Hebron , Ieriah the first , Amariah the second , Iahaziel the third , and Iekamiam the fourth .
Of the sonnes of Uzziel : Michah the first , and Iesiah the second .
¶ The sonnes of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . The sonnes of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish .
And Eleazar died , and had no sonnes but daughters : and their brethren the sonnes of Kish tooke them .
The sonnes of Mushi : Mahli , and Eder , and Ierimoth , three .
¶ These were the sonnes of Leui after the house of their fathers , euen the chiefe of the fathers , as they were counted by number of names by their polles , that did the worke for the seruice of the house of the Lord , from the age of twentie yeeres and vpward .
For Dauid sayd , The Lord God of Israel hath giuen rest vnto his people , that they may dwell in Ierusalem for euer .
And also vnto the Leuites : they shall no more cary the Tabernacle , nor any vessels of it for the seruice thereof .
For by the last words of Dauid , the Leuites were numbred from twentie yeeres olde , and aboue :
Because their office was to wait on the sonnes of Aaron , for the seruice of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the worke of the seruice of the house of God :
Both for the shew - bread , and for the fine floure for meat offering , and for the vnleauened cakes , and for that which is baked in the panne , and for that which is fried , and for all maner of measures and size : And to stand euery morning to thanke and praise the Lord , and likewise at Euen :
And to offer all burnt sacrifices vnto the Lord in the Sabbaths , in the new moones , and on the set feasts , by number , according to the order commanded vnto them continually before the Lord :
<NON-VERSE>
Now these are the diuisions of the sonnes of Aaron . The sonnes of Aaron : Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father , and had no children : Therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the Priests office .
And Dauid distributed them , both Zadok of the sonnes of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sonnes of Ithamar , according to their offices in their seruice .
And there were moe chiefe men found of the sonnes of Eleazar , then of the sonnes of Ithamar : and thus were they diuided . Among the sonnes of Eleazar there were sixteene chiefe men of the house of their fathers , and eight among the sonnes of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers .
Thus were they diuided by lot , one sort with another ; for the gouernours of the Sanctuarie , and gouernours of the house of God , were of the sonnes of Eleazar , and of the sonnes of Ithamar .
And Shemaiah the sonne of Nathanael the Scribe , one of the Leuites , wrote them before the King and the Princes , and Zadok the Priest , and Ahimelech the sonne of Abiathar , and before the chiefe of the fathers of the priests and Leuites : one principall houshold being taken for Eleazar , and one taken for Ithamar .
Now the first lot came foorth to Iehoiarib : the second to Iedaiah , The third to Harim , the fourth to Seorim ,
The ninth to Ieshua , the tenth to Shecaniah ,
The eleuenth to Eliashib , the twelfth to Iakim , The thirteenth to Huppah , the fourteenth to Ieshebeab ,
The three and twentieth to Delaiah , the foure and twentieth to Maaziah .
These were the orderings of them in their seruice to come into the house of the Lord according to their maner , vnder Aaron their father , as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him .
Of the Izharites , Shelomoth : of the sonnes of Shelomoth , Iahath .
And the sonnes of Hebron , Ieriah the first , Amariah the second , Iahaziel the third , Iekameam the fourth . Of the sonnes of Uzziel , Michah : of the sonnes of Michah , Shamir .
The brother of Michah was Isshiah : of the sonnes of Isshiah , Zechariah . The sonnes of Merari were Mahli and Mushi : the sonnes of Iaaziah , Beno .
Concerning Kish : the sonne of Kish was Ierahmeel .
The sonnes also of Mushi , Mahli , and Eder , and Ierimoth . These were the sonnes of the Leuites after the house of their fathers .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer Dauid and the captaines of the hoste separated to the seruice of the sonnes of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Ieduthun , who should prophesie with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen , according to their seruice , was :
Of the sonnes of Asaph : Zaccur , and Ioseph , and Nethaniah , and Asarelah , the sonnes of Asaph vnder the hands of Asaph , which prophesied according to the order of the king .
Of Ieduthun : the sonnes of Ieduthun , Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Ieshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , sixe , vnder the handes of their father Ieduthun , who prophesied with a harpe , to giue thankes and to praise the Lord .
Of Heman : the sonnes of Heman , Bukkiah , Mattaniah , Uzziel , Shebuel , and Ierimoth , Hananiah , Hanani , Eliatha , Giddalti , and Romamti - Ezer , Ioshbekashah , Mallothi , Hothir , and Mahazioth :
All these were the sonnes of Heman the kings Seer in the wordes of God , to lift vp the horne . And God gaue to Heman fourteene sonnes and three daughters .
All these were vnder the hands of their father , for song in the house of the Lord with cymbals , psalteries and harpes , for the seruice of the house of God , according to the kings order , to Asaph , Ieduthun , and Heman .
So the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord , euen all that were cunning , was two hundred , foure score and eight .
¶ And they cast lots ward against ward , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholler .
Now the first lot came foorth for Asaph to Ioseph , the second to Gedaliah , who with his brethren and sonnes were twelue :

Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel , neither was the number put in the account of the Chronicles of King Dauid .
¶ And ouer the Kings treasures , was Azmaueth the sonne of Adiel : and ouer the store - houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Iehonathan the sonne of Uzziah .

And Ahitophel was the kings counseller , and Hushai the Archite , was the kings companion .
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid assembled all the Princes of Israel , the Princes of the tribes , and the captains of the companies that ministred to the king by course : and the captaines ouer the thousands , and captaines ouer the hundreds , and the stewards ouer all the substance and possession of the King , and of his sonnes , with the officers , and with the mightie men , and with all the valiant men , vnto Ierusalem .
Then Dauid the king stood vp vpon his feete , and said , Heare me , my brethren , and my people : As for me , I had in mine heart to builde an house of rest for the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , and for the footestoole of our God , & had made ready for the building .
But God said vnto me , Thou shalt not builde an house for my Name , because thou hast been a man of warre , and hast shed blood .
Howbeit , the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father , to be king ouer Israel for euer : for he hath chosen Iudah to be the ruler ; & of the house of Iudah , the house of my father ; and among the sonnes of my father , he liked me to make me king ouer all Israel :
And of all my sonnes ( for the Lord hath giuen me many sonnes ) hee hath chosen Solomon my sonne , to sit vpon the throne of the kingdome of the Lord ouer Israel .
And he said vnto me , Solomon thy sonne , hee shall build my house and my courts : for I haue chosen him to be my sonne , and I will be his father .
Moreouer , I will establish his kingdome for euer , if he be constant to do my commandements and my iudgements , as at this day .
Now therefore in the sight of all Israel , the congregation of the Lord , and in the audience of our God , keepe , and seeke for all the commandements of the Lord your God , that ye may possesse this good land , and leaue it for an inheritance for your children after you , for euer .
¶ And thou , Solomon my sonne , know thou the God of thy father , and serue him with a perfite heart , and with a willing minde : for the Lord searcheth all hearts , and vnderstandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts : if thou seeke him , he will be found of thee , but if thou forsake him , he will cast thee off for euer .
Take heed now , for the Lord hath chosen thee to builde an house for the Sanctuarie : be strong , and doe it .
¶ Then Dauid gaue to Solomon his sonne the paterne of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the vpper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the Mercie - seate .
And the paterne of all that hee had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the chambers round about , of the treasuries of the house of God , and of the treasuries of the dedicate things :
Also for the courses of the Priests and the Leuites , & for all the worke of the seruice of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of seruice in the house of the Lord .
Hee gaue of golde by weight , for things of golde , for all instruments of all manner of seruice : siluer also for all instruments of siluer , by weight , for all instruments of euery kinde of seruice :
Euen the weight for the Candlestickes of golde , and for their lampes of golde , by weight for euery candlesticke , and for the lampes thereof : and for the Candlestickes of siluer by weight , both for the Candlesticke and also for the lampes thereof , according to the vse of euery candlesticke .
And by weight hee gaue golde for the tables of shew - bread , for euery table , and likewise siluer for the tables of siluer .
Also pure golde for the fleshhookes , and the bowles , and the cups : and for the golden basins hee gaue golde by weight , for euery basin ; and likewise siluer by weight , for euery basin of siluer .
And for the Altar of incense , refined golde by weight ; and gold for the paterne of the charet of the Cherubims , that spread out their wings , and couered the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord .
All this , sayd Dauid , the Lord made mee understand in writing by his hand vpon mee , euen all the workes of this paterne .
And Dauid said to Solomon his sonne , Be strong , and of good courage , and doe it : feare not , nor be dismayed , for the Lord God , euen my God , will be with thee ; he will not faile thee , nor forsake thee , vntill thou hast finished all the worke for the seruice of the house of the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Furthermore , Dauid the King said vnto all the congregation , Solomon my sonne , whome alone God hath chosen , is yet young and tender , and the worke is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the Lord God .
Now I haue prepared with all my might for the house of my God , the gold for things to be made of gold , the siluer for things of siluer , and the brasse for things of brasse , the yron for things of yron , and wood for things of wood , onix stones , and stones to be set , glistering stones , and of diuers colours , and all maner of precious stones , and marble stones in abundance .
Moreouer , because I haue set my affection to the house of my God , I haue of mine owne proper good , of gold and siluer , which I haue giuen to the house of my God , ouer & aboue all that I haue prepared for the holy house :
Euen three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seuen thousand talents of refined siluer , to ouerlay the walles of the houses withall .
The gold for things of golde , and the siluer for things of siluer , and for all maner of worke to be made by the hands of Artificers . And who then is willing to consecrate his seruice this day vnto the Lord ?
¶ Then the chiefe of the fathers and Princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captaines of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers ouer the Kings worke , offered willingly ,
And gaue for the seruice of the house of God , of gold fiue thousand talents , and ten thousand drammes : and of siluer , ten thousand talents : and of brasse , eighteene thousand talents : and one hundred thousand talents of yron .
And they with whom precious stones were found , gaue them to the treasure of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Iehiel the Gershonite .
Then the people reioyced , for that they offred willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord : and Dauid the King also reioyced with great ioy .
¶ Wherefore Dauid blessed the Lord before all the Congregation : and Dauid saide , Blessed bee thou , Lord God of Israel our father , for euer and euer .
Thine , O Lord , is the greatnes , and the power , and the glory , & the victorie , and the maiestie : for all that is in the heauen & in the earth , is thine : thine is the kingdome , O Lord , and thou art exalted as head aboue all .
Both riches , and honour come of thee , and thou reignest ouer all , and in thine hand is power and might , and in thine hand it is to make great , and to giue strength vnto all .
Now therefore , our God , wee thanke thee , and praise thy glorious Name .
But who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine owne haue we giuen thee .
For we are strangers before thee , and soiourners , as were all our fathers : Our dayes on the earth are as a shadow , and there is none abiding .
O Lord our God , all this store that we haue prepared to build thee an house for thine holy Name , commeth of thine hand , and is all thine owne .
I know also , my God , that thou triest the heart , and hast pleasure in vprightnesse . As for me , in the vprightnes of mine heart I haue willingly offered all these things : and now haue I seene with ioy , thy people which are present here , to offer willingly vnto thee .
O Lord God of Abraham , Isaac and of Israel our fathers , keepe this for euer in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people , and prepare their heart vnto thee :
And giue vnto Solomon my sonne a perfect heart to keepe thy Commaundements , thy testimonies , and thy statutes , and to doe all these things , and to build the pallace , for the which I haue made prouision .
¶ And Dauid said to all the Congregation : Nowe blesse the Lord your God . And all the Congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers , and bowed downe their heads , and worshipped the Lord , and the King .
And they sacrificed sacrifices vnto the Lord , & offered burnt offerings vnto the Lord on the morrow after that day , euen a thousand bullockes , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambes , with their drinke offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
And did eate and drinke before the Lord on that day with great gladnesse , and they made Solomon the sonne of Dauid King the second time , and anointed him vnto the Lord to be the chiefe gouernour , and Zadok to be Priest .
Then Solomon sate on the throne of the Lord , as king in stead of Dauid his father , and prospered , and all Israel obeyed him .
And all the princes and the mightie men , and all the sonnes likewise of king Dauid , submitted themselues vnto Solomon the King .
And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed vpon him such royal maiestie , as had not bene on any king before him in Israel .
¶ Thus Dauid the sonne of Iesse , reigned ouer all Israel .
And the time that he reigned ouer Israel , was fourtie yeeres . Seuen yeeres reigned hee in Hebron , and thirtie and three yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem .
And he died in a good old age , full of dayes , riches and honour : and Solomon his sonne reigned in his stead .
Now the acts of Dauid the King first and last , behold , they are written in the booke of Samuel the Seer , and in the booke of Nathan the Prophet , and in the booke of Gad the Seer ,
<NON-VERSE>
Paul called to be an Apostle of Iesus Christ , through the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother ,
Unto the Church of God which is at Corinth , to them that are sanctified in Christ Iesus , called to be Saints , with all that in euery place call vpon the Name of Iesus Christ our Lord , both theirs and ours .
Grace be vnto you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Iesus Christ .
I thanke my God alwayes on your behalfe , for the grace of God which is giuen you by Iesus Christ ,
That in euery thing yee are enriched by him , in all vtterance , and in all knowledge :
Euen as the Testimony of Christ was confirmed in you .
So that yee come behinde in no gift ; wayting for the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ ,
Who shall also confirme you vnto the end , that yee may be blamelesse in the day of our Lord Iesus Christ .
God is faithful by whom ye were called vnto the felowship of his Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord .
Now I beseech you brethren by the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ , that yee all speake the same thing , and that there be no diuisions among you : but that ye be perfectly ioyned together in the same minde , and in the same iudgement .
For it hath bene declared vnto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Cloe , that there are contentions among you .
Now this I say , that euery one of you saith , I am of Paul , and I of Apollo , and I of Cephas , and I of Christ .
Is Christ diuided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were yee baptized in the name of Paul ?
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Gospel : not with wisedome of words , lest the Crosse of Christ should be made of none effect .
For the preaching of the Crosse is to them that perish , foolishnesse : but vnto vs which are saued , it is the power of God .
For it is written , I will destroy the wisedome of the wise , and wil bring to nothing the vnderstanding of the prudent .
Where is the wise ? where is the Scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? Hath not God made foolish the wisedome of this world ?
For after that , in the wisedom of God , the world by wisedome knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching , to saue them that beleeue .
For the Iewes require a signe , and the Greekes seeke after wisedome .
But wee preach Christ crucified , vnto the Iewes a stumbling block , and vnto the Greekes , foolishnesse :
But vnto them which are called , both Iewes and Greekes , Christ , the power of God , & the wisedome of God .
Because the foolishnesse of God is wiser then men : and the weakenesse of God is stronger then men .
For ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble are called .
But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world , to confound the wise : and God hath chosen the weake things of the world , to confound the things which are mighty :
And base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are ,
That no flesh should glory in his presence .
But of him are ye in Christ Iesus , who of God is made vnto vs wisedome , and righteousnesse , and sanctification , and redemption :
<NON-VERSE>
And I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellencie of speech , or of wisedome , declaring vnto you the testimony of God .
For I determined not to know any thing among you , saue Iesus Christ , and him crucified .
And I was with you in weakenesse , and in feare , and in much trembling .
And my speech , and my preaching was not with entising words of mans wisedome , but in demonstration of the Spirit , and of power :
That your faith should not stand in the wisdome of men , but in the power of God .
Howbeit wee speake wisedome among them that are perfect : yet not the wisedome of this worlde , nor of the Princes of this worlde , that come to nought :
But wee speake the wisedome of God in a mysterie , euen the hidden wisedome which God ordeined before the world , vnto our glory .
Which none of the princes of this world knewe : for had they knowen it , they would not haue crucified the Lord of glory .
But as it is written , Eye hath not seene , nor eare heard , neither haue entred into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that loue him .
But God hath reueiled them vnto vs by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deepe things of God .
For what man knoweth the things of a man , saue the spirit of man which is in him ? Euen so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
Now wee haue receiued , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is of God , that wee might know the things that are freely giuen to vs of God .
Which things also we speake , not in the words which mans wisedome teacheth , but which the holy Ghost teacheth , comparing spiritual things with spirituall .
But the naturall man receiueth not the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishnesse vnto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
But he that is spirituall , iudgeth all things , yet he himselfe is iudged of no man .
<NON-VERSE>
And I , brethren , could not speake vnto you as vnto spirituall , but as vnto carnall , euen as vnto babes in Christ .
I haue fed you with milke , and not with meate : for hitherto yee were not able to beare it , neither yet now are ye able .
For ye are yet carnall : for whereas there is among you enuying , and strife , and diuisions , are ye not carnall , and walke as men ?
For while one saieth , I am of Paul , and another , I am of Apollo , are ye not carnall ?
Who then is Paul ? and who is Apollo ? but ministers by whom ye beleeued , euen as the Lord gaue to euery man .
I haue planted , Apollo watered : but God gaue the encrease .
So then , neither is he that planteth any thing , neither hee that watereth : but God that giueth the increase .
Now hee that planteth , and hee that watereth , are one : and euery man shal receiue his own reward according to his owne labour .
For wee are labourers together with God , ye are Gods husbandry , yee are Gods building .
According to the grace of God which is giuen vnto mee , as a wise master builder I haue laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let euery man take heede how hee buildeth thereupon .
For other foundation can no man lay , then that is laide , which is Iesus Christ .
If any mans worke abide which he hath built thereupon , he shal receiue a reward .
If any mans worke shall bee burnt , he shall suffer losse : but he himselfe shall be saued : yet so , as by fire .
Knowe yee not that yee are the Temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
If any man defile the Temple of God , him shall God destroy : for the Temple of God is holy , which Temple ye are .
Let no man deceiue himselfe : If any man among you seemeth to bee wise in this world , let him become a foole , that he may be wise .
For the wisedome of this world is foolishnesse with God : for it is written , Hee taketh the wise in their owne craftinesse .
And againe , The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vaine .
Therefore let no man glory in men , for all things are yours .
Whether Paul , or Apollo , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come , all are yours .
<NON-VERSE>
Let a man so account of vs , as of the ministers of Christ , and stewards of the mysteries of God .
Moreouer , it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithfull .
But with mee it is a very small thing that I should bee iudged of you , or of mans iudgement : yea , I iudge not mine owne selfe .
For I know nothing by my selfe , yet am I not hereby iustified : but hee that iudgeth me is the Lord .
Therefore iudge nothing before the time , vntill the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkenesse , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall euery man haue prayse of God .
And these things , brethren , I haue in a figure transferred to my selfe , and to Apollo , for your sakes : that ye might learne in vs not to thinke of men , aboue that which is written , that no one of you bee puffed vp for one against another .
For who maketh thee to differ from another ? And what hast thou that thou didst not receiue ? Now if thou didst receiue it , why doest thou glory as if thou hadst not receiued it ?
Now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye haue reigned as kings without vs , and I would to God ye did reigne , that we also might reigne with you .
For I thinke that God hath set forth vs the Apostles last , as it were approued to death . For wee are made a spectacle vnto the world , and to Angels , and to men .
We are fooles for Christs sake , but ye are wise in Christ . We are weake , but ye are strong : yee are honourable , but we are despised .
Euen vnto this present houre we both hunger and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and haue no certaine dwelling place ,
And labour , working with our owne hands : being reuiled , wee blesse : being persecuted , we suffer it :
Being defamed , we intreate : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the off - scouring of all things vnto this day .
I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloued sonnes I warne you .
For though you haue ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet haue yee not many fathers : For in Christ Iesus I haue begotten you through the Gospel .
Wherefore I beseech you , be yee followers of me .
For this cause haue I sent vnto you Timotheus , who is my beloued sonne , and faithfull in the Lord , who shal bring you into remembrance of my wayes which be in Christ , as I teach euery where in euery Church .
Nowe some are puffed vp as though I would not come to you .
But I wil come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will knowe , not the speach of them which are puffed vp , but the power .
For the kingdome of God is not in word , but in power .
<NON-VERSE>
It is reported commonly , that there is fornication among you , and such fornication , as is not so much as named amongst the Gentiles , that one should haue his fathers wife .
And yee are puffed vp , and haue not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed , might bee taken away from among you . For I verily as absent in body , but present in spirit , haue iudged alreadie , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
In the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ , when yee are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Iesus Christ ,
To deliuer such a one vnto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus .
Your glorying is not good : know ye not that a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe ?
Purge out therefore the olde leauen , that ye may be a new lumpe , as ye are vnleauened . For euen Christ our Passeouer is sacrificed for vs .
Therefore let vs keepe the Feast , not with old leauen , neither with the leauen of malice and wickednesse : but with the vnleauened bread of sinceritie and trueth .
I wrote vnto you in an Epistle , not to company with fornicators .
Yet not altogether with the fornicatours of this world , or with the couetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must yee needs goe out of the world .
But now I haue written vnto you , not to keepe company , if any man that is called a brother bee a fornicator , or couetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner : with such a one , no , not to eate .
For what haue I to doe to iudge them also that are without ? doe not ye iudge them that are within ?
<NON-VERSE>
Dare any of you , hauing a matter against another , goe to law before the vniust , and not before the Saints ?
Do ye not know that the Saints shall iudge the world ? And if the world shalbe iudged by you , are ye vnworthy to iudge the smallest matters ?
Know ye not that we shall iudge Angels ? How much more things that perteine to this life ?
If then yee haue iudgements of things perteining to this life , set them to iudge who are least esteemed in the Church .
Now therefore , there is vtterly a fault among you , because yee goe to law one with another : Why doe ye not rather take wrong ? Why doe yee not rather suffer your selues to be defrauded ?
Nay , you do wrong and defraud , and that your brethren .
Know yee not that the vnrighteous shall not inherite the kingdome of God ? Be not deceiued : neither fornicatours , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselues with mankinde ,
Nor theeues , nor couetous , nor drunkards , nor reuilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of God .
And such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are iustified in the Name of the Lord Iesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
All things are lawfull vnto mee , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawfull for mee , but I will not bee brought vnder the power of any .
Meats for the belly , and the belly for meates : but God shall destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord : and the Lord for the body .
And God hath both raised vp the Lord , and will also raise vp vs by his owne power .
Know yee not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
What , know ye not that he which is ioyned to an harlot , is one body ? for two ( saith he ) shalbe one flesh .
But hee that is ioyned vnto the Lord , is one spirit .
Flee fornication : Euery sinne that a man doeth , is without the body : but he that committeth fornication , sinneth against his owne body .
What , know ye not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghost which is in you , which yee haue of God , and ye are not your owne ?
<NON-VERSE>
Now concerning the things wherof ye wrote vnto me , It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
Neuerthelesse , to auoid fornication , let euery man haue his owne wife , and let euery woman haue her owne husband .
Let the husband render vnto the wife due beneuolence : and likewise also the wife vnto the husband .
The wife hath not power of her owne body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his owne body , but the wife .
Defraud you not one the other , except it bee with consent for a time , that yee may giue your selues to fasting and prayer , and come together againe , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinencie .
But I speake this by permission , and not of commandement .
For I would that all men were euen as I my selfe : but euery man hath his proper gift of God , one after this maner , and another after that .
I say therefore to the vnmaried and widowes , It is good for them if they abide euen as I .
But if they cannot conteine , let them marry : for it is better to marrie then to burne .
And vnto the married , I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
But and if shee depart , let her remaine vnmaried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
But to the rest speake I , not the Lord , If any brother hath a wife that beleeueth not , and shee bee pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
And the woman which hath an husband that beleeueth not , and if hee be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leaue him .
For the vnbeleeuing husband is sanctified by the wife , and the vnbeleeuing wife is sanctified by the husband ; else were your children vncleane , but now are they holy .
But if the vnbeleeuing depart , let him depart . A brother or a sister is not vnder bondage in such cases : but God hath called vs to peace .
For what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt saue thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt saue thy wife ?
But as God hath distributed to euery man , as the Lord hath called euery one , so let him walke , and so ordeine I in all Churches .
Is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become vncircumcised : Is any called in vncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
Circumcision is nothing , and vncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the Commandements of God .
Let euery man abide in the same calling wherein he was called .
Art thou called being a seruant ? care not for it : but if thou maist be made free , vse it rather .
For he that is called in the Lord , being a seruant , is the Lords free man : likewise also hee that is called being free , is Christs seruant .
Ye are bought with a price , be not ye the seruants of men .
Brethren , let euery man wherin he is called , therein abide with God .
Nowe concerning virgins , I haue no commaundement of the Lord : yet I giue my iudgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithfull .
I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distresse , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
Art thou bound vnto a wife ? seeke not to bee loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seeke not a wife .
But and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned , and if a virgin marry , shee hath not sinned : neuerthelesse , such shall haue trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
But this I say , brethren , the time is short . It remaineth , that both they that haue wiues , be as though they had none :
And they that weepe , as though they wept not : and they that reioyce , as though they reioyced not : and they that buy , as though they possessed not :
And they that vse this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin : the vnmaried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that shee may be holy , both in body and in spirit : but she that is married , careth for the things of the worlde , how shee may please her husband .
And this I speake for your owne profite , not that I may cast a snare vpon you , but for that which is comely , and that you may attend vpon the Lord without distraction .
But if any man thinke that he behaueth himselfe vncomely toward his virgin , if she passe the floure of her age , and neede so require , let him doe what hee will , hee sinneth not : let them marry .
Neuerthelesse , hee that standeth stedfast in his heart , hauing no necessitie , but hath power ouer his owne will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keepe his virgin , doeth well .
So then he that giueth her in mariage , doeth wel : but he that giueth her not in mariage , doeth better .
The wife is bound by the Lawe as long as her husband liueth : but if her husband bee dead , shee is at liberty to bee maried to whom shee will , onely in the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Now as touching things offered vnto idoles , wee know that wee all haue knowledge . Knowledge puffeth vp : but Charitie edifieth .
And if any man thinke that hee knoweth any thing , hee knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
But if any man loue God , the same is knowen of him .
As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice vnto idoles , wee know that an idole is nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
For though there bee that are called gods , whether in heauen or in earth ( as there be gods many , and lords many : )
But to vs there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him , and one Lord Iesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
Howbeit there is not in euerie man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idole vnto this houre , eate it as a thing offred vnto an idole , and their conscience being weake , is defiled .
But meate commendeth vs not to God : for neither if we eate , are we the better : neither if wee eate not , are we the worse .
But take heed lest by any meanes , this libertie of yours become a stumbling blocke to them that are weake .
For if any man see thee which hast knowledge , sit at meat in the idols temple : shall not the conscience of him which is weake , be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols ?
And through thy knowledge shal the weake brother perish , for whome Christ died ?
But when ye sinne so against the brethren , and wound their weake conscience , ye sinne against Christ .
<NON-VERSE>
Am I not an Apostle ? am I not free ? haue I not seene Iesus Christ our Lord ? Are not you my worke in the Lord ?
If I bee not an Apostle vnto others , yet doubtlesse I am to you : for the seale of mine Apostleship are yee in the Lord .
Mine answere to them that doe examine me , is this :
Haue wee not power to eate and to drinke ?
Haue we not power to lead about a sister a wife aswel as other Apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
Or I onely and Barnabas , haue not we power to forbeare working ?
Who goeth a warfare any time at his owne charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruite thereof ? or who feedeth a flocke , and eateth not of the milke of the flocke ?
Say I these things as a man ? or saith not the Law the same also ?
For it is written in the Law of Moyses , Thou shalt not muzzell the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne : doth God take care for oxen ?
Or saith hee it altogether for our sakes ? for our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that hee that ploweth , should plow in hope : and that hee that thresheth in hope , should bee partaker of his hope .
If we haue sowen vnto you spirituall things , is it a great thing if wee shall reape your carnall things ?
If others bee partakers of this power ouer you , are not we rather ? Neuerthelesse , we haue not vsed this power : but suffer all things , lest wee should hinder the Gospel of Christ .
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things , liue of the things of the Temple ? and they which wait at the altar , are partakers with the altar ?
Euen so hath the Lord ordeined , that they which preach the Gospel , should liue of the Gospel .
But I haue vsed none of these things . Neither haue I written these things , that it should bee so done vnto me : for it were better for me to die , then that any man should make my glorying voyd .
For though I preach the Gospel , I haue nothing to glorie of : for necessitie is laid vpon mee , yea , woe is vnto me , if I preach not the Gospel .
For if I doe this thing willingly , I haue a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the Gospel is committed vnto me .
What is my reward then ? verily that when I preach the Gospel , I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the Gospel .
For though I bee free from all men , yet haue I made my selfe seruant vnto all , that I might gaine the more .
And vnto the Iewes , I became as a Iew , that I might gaine the Iewes : to them that are vnder the Law , as vnder the Law , that I might gaine them that are vnder the Law :
To them that are without Law , as without Law ( being not without Law to God , but vnder the Law to Christ , ) that I might gaine them that are without Law .
To the weake became I as weake , that I might gaine the weake : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all meanes saue some .
And this I doe for the Gospels sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
Know yee not that they which runne in a race , runne all , but one receiueth the price ? So runne , that yee may obtaine .
And euery man that striueth for the masterie , is temperate in all things : Now they doe it to obtaine a corruptible crowne , but we an incorruptible .
I therefore so runne , not as vncertainely : so fight I , not as one that beateth the ayre :
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer brethren , I would not that yee should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were vnder the cloud , and all passed thorow the Sea :
And were all baptized vnto Moyses in the cloud , and in the sea :
And did all eat the same spirituall meat :
And did all drinke the same spirituall drinke : ( for they dranke of that spirituall Rocke that followed them : and that Rocke was Christ )
But with many of them God was not well pleased : for they were ouerthrowen in the wildernesse .
Now these things were our examples , to the intent wee should not lust after euil things , as they also lusted .
Neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them , as it is written , The people sate downe to eate and drinke , and rose vp to play .
Neither let vs commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twentie thousand .
Neither let vs tempt Christ , as some of them also tempted , and were destroyed of serpents .
Neither murmure ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
Now all these things happened vnto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , vpon whom the ends of the world are come .
Wherefore , let him that thinketh he standeth , take heed lest he fall .
There hath no temptation taken you , but such as is common to man : but God is faithfull , who wil not suffer you to bee tempted aboue that you are able : but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may bee able to beare it .
Wherefore my dearely beloued , flee from idolatrie .
I speake as to wise men : iudge ye what I say .
The cup of blessing which wee blesse , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we breake , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
For we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all partakers of that one bread .
Behold Israel after the flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices , partakers of the Altar ?
What say I then ? that the idole is any thing ? or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ?
But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to deuils , and not to God : and I would not that yee should haue fellowship with deuils .
Yee cannot drinke the cup of the Lord , and the cup of deuils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lords Table , and of the table of deuils .
Doe we prouoke the Lord to iealousie ? are we stronger then he ?
All things are lawfull for me , but all things are not expedient : All things are lawfull for mee , but all things edifie not .
Let no man seeke his owne : but euery man anothers wealth .
Whatsoeuer is solde in the shambles , that eate , asking no question for conscience sake .
But if any man say vnto you , This is offered in sacrifice vnto idoles , eate not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake . The earth is the Lords , and the fulnesse thereof .
Conscience I say , not thine owne , but of the others : for why is my libertie iudged of another mans conscience ?
For , if I by grace be a partaker , why am I euill spoken of , for that for which I giue thankes ?
Whether therfore ye eat or drinke , or whatsoeuer ye doe , doe all to the glory of God .
Giue none offence , neither to the Iewes , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the Church of God :
<NON-VERSE>
Be yee followers of mee , euen as I also am of Christ .
Now I prayse you , brethren , that you remember me in all things , and keepe the ordinances , as I deliuered them to you .
But I would haue you knowe , that the head of euery man is Christ : and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
For if the woman be not couered , let her also bee shorne : but if it bee a shame for a woman to be shorne or shauen , let her be couered .
For a man in deede ought not to couer his head , forasmuch as hee is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
For the man is not of the woman : but the woman of the man .
Neither was the man created for the woman : but the woman for the man .
For this cause ought the woman to haue power on her head , because of the Angels .
Neuerthelesse , neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man in the Lord .
For as the woman is of the man : euen so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of God .
But if a woman haue long haire , it is a glory to her : for her haire is giuen her for a couering .
But if any man seeme to be contentious , we haue no such custome , neither the Churches of God .
Now in this that I declare vnto you , I praise you not , that you come together not for the better , but for the worse .
For first of all when yee come together in the Church , I heare that there be diuisions among you , and I partly beleeue it .
For in eating , euery one taketh before other , his owne supper : and one is hungry , and an other is drunken .
What , haue ye not houses to eate and to drinke in ? Or despise yee the Church of God , and shame them that haue not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I prayse you not .
For I haue receiued of the Lord that which also I deliuered vnto you , that the Lord Iesus , the same night in which he was betrayed , tooke bread :
And when he had giuen thanks , he brake it , and sayd , Take , eate , this is my body , which is broken for you : this doe in remembrance of mee .
After the same manner also hee tooke the cup when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new Testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drinke it , in remembrance of me .
For as often as ye eate this bread , and drinke this cup , yee doe shew the Lords death till he come .
Wherefore , whosoeuer shall eate this bread , and drinke this cup of the Lord vnworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
But let a man examine himselfe , and so let him eate of that bread , and drinke of that cup .
For hee that eateth and drinketh vnworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himselfe , not discerning the Lords body .
For this cause many are weake and sickly among you , and many sleepe .
For if we would iudge our selues , we should not be iudged .
But when we are iudged , we are chastened of the Lord , that wee should not be condemned with the world .
Wherefore my brethren , when ye come together to eate , tary one for another .
<NON-VERSE>
Now concerning spirituall giftes , brethren , I would not haue you ignorant .
Yee know that yee were Gentiles , caryed away vnto these dumbe idoles , euen as ye were led .
And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
And there are diuersities of operations , but it is the same God , which worketh all in all .
But the manifestation of the spirit , is giuen to euery man to profit withall .
For to one is giuen by the spirit , the word of wisedome , to another the word of knowledge , by the same spirit .
To another faith , by the same spirit : to another the gifts of healing , by the same spirit :
To another the working of miracles , to another prophecie , to another discerning of spirits , to another diuers kindes of tongues , to another the interpretation of tongues .
But all these worketh that one and the selfe same spirit , diuiding to euery man seuerally as he will .
For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the membrs of that one body , being many , are one bodie : so also is Christ .
For by one spirit are we all baptized into one bodie , whether wee bee Iewes or Gentiles , whether wee bee bond or free : and haue beene all made to drinke into one spirit .
For the body is not one member , but many .
If the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body : is it therefore not of the body ?
And if the eare shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body : is it therefore not of the body ?
If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ? But now hath God set the members , euery one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
And if they were all one member , where were the body ?
But now are they many members , yet but one body .
That there should be no schisme in the body : but that the members should haue the same care one for another .
And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it : or one member be honoured , all the members reioyce with it .
Now yee are the body of Christ , and members in particular . And God hath set some in the Church , first Apostles , secondarily Prophets , thirdly Teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helpes in gouernments , diuersities of tongues .
Are all Apostles ? are all Prophets ? are all Teachers ? are all workers of miracles ? Haue all the gifts of healing ? doe all speake with tongues ? doe all interpret ?
<NON-VERSE>
Though I speake with the tongues of men & of Angels , and haue not charity , I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal .
And though I haue the gift of prophesie , and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge : and though I haue all faith , so that I could remooue mountaines , and haue no charitie , I am nothing .
And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore , and though I giue my body to bee burned , and haue not charitie , it profiteth me nothing .
Charitie suffereth long , and is kinde : charitie enuieth not : charitie vaunteth not it selfe , is not puffed vp ,
Doeth not behaue it selfe vnseemly , seeketh not her owne , is not easily prouoked , thinketh no euill ,
Reioyceth not in iniquitie , but reioyceth in the trueth :
Beareth all things , beleeueth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
Charitie neuer faileth : but whether there be prophesies , they shall faile ; whether there bee tongues , they shall cease ; whether there bee knowledge , it shall vanish away .
For we know in part , and we prophesie in part .
But when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part , shalbe done away .
When I was a childe , I spake as a childe , I vnderstood as a childe , I thought as a childe : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
For now we see through a glasse , darkely : but then face to face : now I know in part , but then shall I know euen as also I am knowen .
<NON-VERSE>
Follow after charitie , and desire spirituall giftes , but rather that yee may prophesie .
For he that speaketh in an vnknowen tongue , speaketh not vnto men , but vnto God : for no man vnderstandeth him : howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
But he that prophesieth , speaketh vnto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
He that speaketh in an vnknowen tongue , edifieth himselfe : but hee that prophesieth , edifieth the Church .
I would that yee all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is hee that prophesieth , then hee that speaketh with tongues , except hee interprete , that the Church may receiue edifying .
Now brethren , if I come vnto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speake to you either by reuelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
And euen things without life giuing sound , whether pipe or harpe , except they giue a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be knowen what is piped or harped ?
For if the trumpet giue an vncertaine sound , who shall prepare himselfe to the battell ?
So likewise you , except ye vtter by the tongue words easie to be vnderstood , how shall it be knowen what is spoken ? for ye shall speake into the aire .
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an vnknowen tongue , pray that he may interprete .
For if I pray in an vnknowen tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my vnderstanding is vnfruitfull .
What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and wil pray with vnderstanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the vnderstanding also .
Else , when thou shalt blesse with the spirit , how shall hee that occupieth the roome of the vnlearned , say Amen at thy giuing of thankes , seeing he vnderstandeth not what thou sayest ?
For thou verily giuest thankes well : but the other is not edified .
I thanke my God , I speake with tongues more then you all .
Yet in the Church I had rather speake fiue words with my vnderstanding , that by my voyce I might teach others also , then ten thousand words in an vnknowen tongue .
Brethren , bee not children in vnderstanding : how be it , in malice be yee children , but in vnderstanding be men .
In the Law it is written , With men of other tongues , and other lippes will I speake vnto this people : and yet for all that will they not heare me , saith the Lord .
But if all prophesie , and there come in one that beleeueth not , or one vnlearned : he is conuinced of all , he is iudged of all .
And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest , and so falling downe on his face , hee will worship God , and report that God is in you of a trueth .
How is it then brethren ? when ye come together , euery one of you hath a Psalme , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a reuelation , hath an interpretation : Let all things be done vnto edifying .
If any man speake in an vnknowen tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course , and let one interprete .
But if there be no interpreter , let him keepe silence in the Church , and let him speake to himselfe , and to God .
Let the Prophets speake two or three , and let the other iudge .
If any thing be reueiled to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
For yee may all prophesie one by one , that all may learne , and all may be comforted .
And the spirits of the Prophets are subiect to the Prophets .
For God is not the authour of confusion , but of peace , as in all Churches of the Saints .
Let your women keepe silence in the Churches , for it is not permitted vnto them to speake ; but they are commanded to bee vnder obedience : as also saith the Law .
And if they will learne any thing , let them aske their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speake in the Church .
What ? came the word of God out from you ? or came it vnto you onely ?
If any man thinke himselfe to be a Prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge , that the things that I write vnto you , are the commandements of the Lord .
But if any man bee ignorant , let him be ignorant .
Wherefore brethren , couet to prophesie , and forbid not to speake with tongues .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer brethren , I declare vnto you the Gospel which I preached vnto you , which also you haue receiued , and wherein yee stand .
By which also yee are saued , if yee keepe in memorie what I preached vnto you , vnlesse yee haue beleeued in vaine .
For I deliuered vnto you first of all , that which I also receiued , how that Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures :
And that he was buried , and that he rose againe the third day according to the Scriptures .
And that he was seene of Cephas , then of the twelue .
And that hee was seene of aboue fiue hundred brethren at once : of whom the greater part remaine vnto this present , but some are fallen asleepe .
After that , he was seen of Iames , then of all the Apostles .
And last of all he was seene of me also , as of one borne out of due time .
For I am the least of the Apostles , that am not meet to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the Church of God .
But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed vpon me , was not in vaine : But I laboured more abundantly then they all , yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me :
Therefore , whether it were I or they , so we preach , aud so ye beleeued .
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you , that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen .
And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vaine , and your faith is also vaine :
Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God , because we haue testified of God , that he raised vp Christ : whom hee raised not vp , if so bee that the dead rise not .
For if the dead rise not , then is not Christ raised .
And if Christ be not raised , your faith is vaine , ye are yet in your sinnes .
Then they also which are fallen asleepe in Christ , are perished .
If in this life only we haue hope in Christ , wee are of all men most miserable .
But now is Christ risen from the dead , and become the first fruits of them that slept .
For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
For as in Adam all die , euen so in Christ shall all be made aliue .
But euery man in his owne order . Christ the first fruits , afterward they that are Christs , at his comming .
Then commeth the end , when he shall haue deliuered vp the kingdome to God euen the Father , when he shall haue put downe all rule , and all authority and power .
For he must reigne , till hee hath put all enemies vnder his feete .
The last enemie that shall be destroyed , is death .
For he hath put all things vnder his feete ; but when hee saith all things are put vnder him , it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things vnder him .
And when all things shall bee subdued vnto him , then shal the Sonne also himselfe bee subiect vnto him that put all things vnder him , that God may be all in all .
Else what shal they do , which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all , why are they then baptized for the dead ?
And why stand we in ieopardy euery houre ?
I protest by your reioycing which I haue in Christ Iesus our Lord , I die dayly .
If after the maner of men I haue fought with beasts at Ephesus , what aduantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let vs eate and drinke , for to morrowe wee die .
Bee not deceiued : euill communications corrupt good manners .
Awake to righteousnesse , and sinne not : for some haue not the knowledge of God , I speake this to your shame .
And that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare graine , it may chance of wheate , or of some other graine .
But God giueth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to euery seed his owne body .
All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
There are also celestiall bodies , and bodies terrestriall : But the glorie of the celestiall is one , and the glorie of the terrestriall is another .
There is one glory of the sunne , another of the moone , and another glorie of the starres : for one starre differeth from another starre in glorie .
So also is the resurrection of the dead , it is sowen in corruption , it is raised in incorruption .
It is sowen in dishonour , it is raysed in glorie : it is sowen in weakenesse , it is raysed in power :
Howbeit that was not first which is spirituall : but that which is naturall , and afterward that which is spirituall .
The first man is of the earth , earthy : The second man is the Lord from heauen . As is the earthy , such are they that are earthy , and as is the heauenly , such are they also that are heauenly .
And as we haue borne the image of the earthy , wee shall also beare the image of the heauenly .
Now this I say , brethren , that flesh & blood cannot inherite the kingdome of God : neither doth corruption inherite incorruption .
Behold , I shew you a mysterie : we shall not all sleepe , but wee shall all be changed ,
In a moment , in the twinckling of an eye , at the last trumpe , ( for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed . )
For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortall must put on immortalitie .
So when this corruptible shall haue put on incorruption , & this mortall shall haue put on immortality , then shall be brought to passe the saying that is written , Death is swallowed vp in victorie .
O death , where is thy sting ? O graue , where is thy victorie ?
The sting of death is sinne , and the strength of sinne is the law .
But thankes bee to God , which giueth vs the victorie , through our Lord Iesus Christ .

Now concerning the collection for the Saints , as I haue giuen order to the Churches of Galatia , euen so doe ye .
Upon the first day of the weeke , let euery one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
And when I come , whomsoeuer you shall approue by your letters , them wil I send to bring your liberality vnto Ierusalem .
And if it be meet that I goe also , they shall goe with me .
Now I wil come vnto you , when I shall passe through Macedonia : for I doe passe through Macedonia .
And it may bee that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that yee may bring me on my iourny , whithersoeuer I goe .
For I will not see you now by the way , but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
But I will tarry at Ephesus vntill Pentecost .
For a great doore and effectuall is opened vnto mee , and there are many aduersaries .
Now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without feare : for hee worketh the worke of the Lord , as I also doe .
Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that hee may come vnto me : for I looke for him with the brethren .
As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come vnto you with the brethren , but his wil was not at all to come at this time : but he wil come when hee shall haue conuenient time .
Watch yee , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men : be strong .
Let all your things be done with charitie .
I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they haue addicted themselues to the ministery of the Saints , )
That ye submit your selues vnto such , and to euery one that helpeth with vs and laboureth .
I am glad of the comming of Stephanas , and Fortunatus , and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part , they haue supplied .
For they haue refreshed my spirit and yours : therefore acknowledge yee them that are such .
The Churches of Asia salute you : Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the Church that is in their house .
All the brethren greet you : greet ye one another with an holy kisse .
The salutation of me Paul , with mine owne hand .
If any man loue not the Lord Iesus Christ , let him bee Anathema Maranatha . The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you .

That which was from the beginning , which wee haue heard , which wee haue seene with our eyes , which wee haue looked vpon , and our hands haue handled of the word of life .
( For the life was manifested , and we haue seene it , and beare witnes , and shew vnto you that eternall life which was with the Father , and was manifested vnto vs . )
That which wee haue seene and heard , declare we vnto you , that ye also may haue felowship with vs ; and truely our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Sonne Iesus Christ .
And these things write we vnto you , that your ioy may be full .
This then is the message which we haue heard of him , and declare vnto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkenesse at all .
If we say that we haue felowship with him , and walke in darkenesse , we lie , and doe not the trueth .
But if wee walke in the light , as he is in the light , wee haue fellowship one with another , and the blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne clenseth vs from all sinne .
If we say that we haue no sinne , we deceiue our selues , and the trueth is not in vs .
If we confesse our sinnes , hee is faithfull , & iust to forgiue vs our sinnes , and to cleanse vs from all vnrighteousnesse .
<NON-VERSE>
My little children , these things write I vnto you , that ye sinne not . And if any man sinne , we haue an Aduocate with the Father , Iesus Christ the righteous :
And he is the propitiation for our sinnes : and not for ours onely , but also for the sinnes of the whole world .
And hereby wee doe knowe that we know him , if we keepe his commandements .
He that saith , I knowe him , and keepeth not his commandements , is a lyer , and the trueth is not in him .
But who so keepeth his word , in him verely is the loue of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
He that sayeth he abideth in him , ought himselfe also so to walke , euen as he walked .
Brethren , I write no new commandement vnto you , but an olde commandement which ye had from the beginning : the old commandement is the word which ye haue heard from the beginning .
Againe , a new commandement I write vnto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkenesse is past , and the true light now shineth .
He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkenesse euen vntill now .
Hee that loueth his brother , abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
But he that hateth his brother , is in darknesse , and walketh in darknesse , and knoweth not whither hee goeth , because that darknesse hath blinded his eyes .
I write vnto you , little children , because your sinnes are forgiuen you for his Names sake . I write vnto you , fathers , because yee haue knowen him that is from the beginning . I write vnto you , young men , because you haue ouercome the wicked one . I write vnto you , little children , because yee haue knowen the Father .
I haue written vnto you , fathers , because ye haue knowen him that is from the beginning . I haue written vnto you , young men , because yee are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and yee haue ouercome the wicked one .
Loue not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man loue the world , the loue of the Father is not in him .
For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof , but hee that doeth the will of God , abideth for euer .
Little children , it is the last time : and as yee haue heard that Antichrist shall come , euen now are there many Antichrists , whereby wee know that it is the last time .
They went out from vs , but they were not of vs : for if they had beene of vs , they would no doubt haue continued with vs : but they went out that they might be made manifest , that they were not all of vs .
But ye haue an vnction from the holy One , and ye know all things .
I haue not written vnto you , because yee know not the trueth : but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the trueth .
Who is a lier , but hee that denieth that Iesus is the Christ ? hee is Antichrist , that denyeth the Father , and the Sonne .
Whosoeuer denieth the Sonne , the same hath not the Father : but he that acknowledgeth the Sonne , hath the Father also .
Let that therefore abide in you which yee haue heard from the beginning : if that which ye haue heard from the beginning shall remaine in you , yee also shall continue in the Sonne , and in the Father .
And this is the promise that hee hath promised vs , euen eternall life .
These things haue I written vnto you , concerning them that seduce you .
But the anointing which ye haue receiued of him , abideth in you : and yee need not that any man teach you : But , as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is trueth , and is no lye : and euen as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
And now , little children , abide in him , that when hee shall appeare , wee may haue confidence , and not bee ashamed before him at his comming .
<NON-VERSE>
Beholde , what manner of loue the Father hath bestowed vpon vs , that wee should be called the sonnes of God : therfore the world knoweth vs not , because it knewe him not .
Beloued , now are we the sonnes of God , and it doeth not yet appeare , what wee shall be : but wee know , that when he shall appeare , we shall bee like him : for we shall see him as he is .
And euery man that hath this hope in him , purifieth himselfe , euen as he is pure .
Whosoeuer committeth sinne , transgresseth also the lawe : for sinne is the transgression of the law .
And ye know that hee was manifested to take away our sinnes , and in him is no sinne .
Whosoeuer abideth in him , sinneth not : whosoeuer sinneth , hath not seene him , neither knowen him .
Little children , let no man deceiue you : he that doth righteousnes , is righteous , euen as he is righteous .
He that committeth sinne , is of the deuill , for the deuill sinneth from the beginning : for this purpose the Sonne of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the deuill .
Whosoeuer is borne of God , doth not commit sinne : for his seede remaineth in him , and he cannot sinne , because he is borne of God .
In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the deuill : whosoeuer doeth not righteousnesse , is not of God , neither hee that loueth not his brother .
For this is the message that yee heard from the beginning , that wee should loue one another .
Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slewe his brother : and wherefore slewe hee him ? because his owne workes were euill , and his brothers righteous .
Marueile not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
Wee know that wee haue passed from death vnto life , because wee loue the brethren : he that loueth not his brother , abideth in death .
Whosoeuer hateth his brother , is a murtherer , and yee knowe that no murtherer hath eternall life abiding in him .
Hereby perceiue wee the loue of God , because he layd downe his life for vs , and wee ought to lay downe our liues for the brethren .
But who so hath this worlds good , and seeth his brother hath need , and shutteth vp his bowels of compassion from him ; how dwelleth the loue of God in him ?
My little children , let vs not loue in word , neither in tongue , but indeede and in trueth .
And hereby wee know that wee are of the trueth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
For if our heart condemne vs , God is greater then our heart , and knoweth all things .
Beloued , if our heart condemne vs not , then haue wee confidence towards God .
And whatsoeuer we aske , wee receiue of him , because we keepe his commandement , and doe those things that are pleasing in his sight .
And this is his commandement , that we should beleeue on the Name of his Sonne Iesus Christ , and loue one another , as hee gaue vs commandement .
<NON-VERSE>
Beloued , beleeue not euery spirit , but trie the spirits , whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . Hereby know ye the spirit of God : euery spirit that confesseth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh , is of God .
And euery Spirit that confesseth not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh , is not of God : and this is that spirit of Antichrist , whereof you haue heard , that it should come , and euen now already is it in the world .
Ye are of God , little children , and haue ouercome them : because greater is he that is in you , then he that is in the world .
They are of the world : therefore speake they of the world , and the world heareth them .
We are of God : hee that knoweth God , heareth vs : he that is not of God heareth not vs , hereby know wee the spirit of trueth , and the spirit of errour .
Beloued , let vs loue one another ; for loue is of God : and euery one that loueth , is borne of God and knoweth God .
Hee that loueth not , knoweth not God : for God is loue .
In this was manifested the loue of God towards vs , because that God sent his only begotten Sonne into the world , that we might liue through him .
Herein is loue , not that wee loued God , but that he loued vs , and sent his Sonne to be the propitiation for our sins .
Beloued , if God so loued vs , wee ought also to loue one another .
No man hath seene God at any time . If wee loue one another , God dwelleth in vs , and his loue is perfected in vs .
Hereby know wee that we dwell in him and he in vs , because hee hath giuen vs of his Spirit .
And we haue seene , and doe testifie , that the Father sent the Sonne to be the Sauiour of the world .
Whosoeuer shall confesse that Iesus is the Sonne of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
And we haue knowen and beleeued the loue that God hath to vs . God is loue , and hee that dwelleth in loue , dwelleth in God , and God in him .
Herein is our loue made perfect , that wee may haue boldnesse in the day of Iudgement , because as hee is , so are we in this world .
There is no feare in loue , but perfect loue casteth out feare : because feare hath torment : hee that feareth , is not made perfect in loue .
We loue him : because hee first loued vs .
If a man say , I loue God , and hateth his brother , he is a lyar . For hee that loueth not his brother whom hee hath seene , how can he loue God whom he hath not seene ?
<NON-VERSE>
Whosoeuer beleeueth that Iesus is the Christ , is borne of God : and euery one that loueth him that begate , loueth him also that is begotten of him .
By this wee know that wee loue the children of God , when we loue God and keepe his commandements .
For this is the loue of God , that we keepe his commandements , and his commandements are not grieuous .
For whatsoeuer is borne of God , ouercommeth the world , and this is the victorie that ouercommeth the world , euen our faith .
Who is he that ouercommeth the world , but he that beleeueth that Iesus is the Sonne of God ?
And there are three that beare witnesse in earth , the Spirit , and the Water , and the Blood , and these three agree in one .
If we receiue the witnesse of men , the witnesse of God is greater : for this is the witnesse of God , which hee hath testified of his Sonne .
Hee that beleeueth on the Sonne of God , hath the witnesse in himselfe : he that beleeueth not God , hath made him a liar , because he beleeueth not the record that God gaue of his Sonne .
And this is the record , that God hath giuen to vs eternall life , and this life is in his Sonne .
Hee that hath the Sonne , hath life ; and hee that hath not the Sonne , hath not life .
These things haue I written vnto you that beleeue on the Name of the Sonne of God , that ye may know , that ye haue eternall life , and that yee may beleeue on the Name of the Sonne of God .
And this is the confidence that we haue in him , that if wee aske any thing according to his will , hee heareth vs .
And if we know that he heare vs , whatsoeuer wee aske , wee know that we haue the petitions that wee desired of him .
If any man see his brother sinne a sinne which is not vnto death , hee shall aske , and he shall giue him life for them that sinne not vnto death . There is a sinne vnto death : I doe not say that he shall pray for it .
All vnrighteousnes is sinne , and there is a sinne not vnto death .
We know that whosoeuer is borne of God , sinneth not : but hee that is begotten of God , keepeth himselfe , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickednesse .
And we know that the Sonne of God is come , and hath giuen vs an vnderstanding that wee may know him that is true : and wee are in him that is true , euen in his Sonne Iesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternall life .

Now King Dauid was olde , and striken in yeeres , and they couered him with clothes , but hee gate no heate .
Wherefore his seruants said vnto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a yong virgin , and let her stand before the King , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in thy bosome , that my lord the King may get heate .
So they sought for a faire damosel throughout all the coasts of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the King .
And the damosell was very faire , and cherished the king , and ministred to him : but the king knew her not .
¶ Then Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith exalted himselfe , saying , I wil be king : And he prepared him charets and horesemen , and fiftie men to runne before him .
And his father had not displeased him at any time , in saying , Why hast thou done so ? And hee also was a very goodly man , and his mother bare him after Absalom .
And hee conferred with Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the Priest : and they following Adoniiah , helped him .
But Zadok the Priest , and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and Nathan the Prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mightie men which belonged to Dauid , were not with Adoniiah .
And Adoniiah slew sheepe , and oxen , and fat cattell , by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by En - Rogel , and called all his brethren the kings sonnes , and all the men of Iudah the kings seruants .
But Nathan the Prophet , and Benaiah , and the mightie men , and Solomon his brother he called not .
¶ Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath - sheba the mother of Solomon , saying , Hast thou not heard that Adoniiah the son of Haggith doth reigne , and Dauid our lord knoweth it not ?
Now therefore come , let mee , I pray thee , giue thee counsell , that thou mayest saue thine owne life , and the life of thy sonne Solomon .
Goe , and get thee in vnto King Dauid , and say vnto him , Diddest not thou , my lord , O king , sweare vnto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall reigne after mee , and he shall sit vpon my throne ? why then doth Adoniiah reigne ?
Beholde , while thou yet talkest there with the king , I also will come in after thee , and confirme thy words .
¶ And Bath - sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber : and the king was very olde , and Abishag the Shunammite ministred vnto the king .
And Bathsheba bowed , and did obeysance vnto the king : and the king said , What wouldest thou ?
And she said vnto him , My lord , thou swarest by the Lord thy God vnto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall reigne after me , and he shall sit vpon my throne :
And now behold , Adoniiah reigneth ; and now my lord the king , thou knowest it not .
And he hath slaine oxen , and fat cattell , and sheepe in abundance , and hath called all the sonnes of the king , and Abiathar the Priest , and Ioab the captaine of the hoste : but Solomon thy seruant hath he not called .
And thou , my lord O king , the eyes of all Israel are vpon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
Otherwise it shall come to passe , when my lord the king shal sleepe with his fathers , that I and my sonne Solomon shall be counted offenders .
¶ And loe , while shee yet talked with the king , Nathan the Prophet also came in . And they tolde the king , saying , Beholde Nathan the Prophet . And when hee was come in before the king , he bowed himselfe before the king with his face to the ground .
And Nathan said , My lord O king , hast thou said , Adoniiah shall reigne after mee , and hee shall sit vpon my throne ?
For hee is gone downe this day , and hath slaine oxen , and fat cattel , and sheepe in abundance , and hath called all the kings sonnes , and the captaines of the host , and Abiathar the Priest : and behold , they eate and drinke before him , and say , God saue king Adoniiah .
But me , euen me thy seruant , and Zadok the Priest , and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and thy seruant Solomon hath he not called .
Is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it vnto thy seruant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king , after him ?
¶ Then king Dauid answered , and said , Call me Bathsheba . And she came into the kings presence , and stood before the king .
And the king sware , and said , As the Lord liueth , that hath redeemed my soule out of all distresse ,
Euen as I sware vnto thee by the Lord God of Israel , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall reigne after me , and he shal sit vpon my throne in my stead ; euen so wil I certainly doe this day .
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reuerence to the king , and said , Let my lord king Dauid liue for euer .
¶ And king Dauid said , Call me Zadok the Priest , and Nathan the Prophet , and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada . And they came before the king .
The king also saide vnto them , Take with you the seruants of your lord , and cause Solomon my sonne to ride vpon mine owne mule , and bring him downe to Gihon .
And let Zadok the Priest , and Nathan the Prophet , anoint him there King ouer Israel : and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , God saue King Solomon .
Then ye shall come vp after him , that hee may come and sit vpon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I haue appointed him to be ruler ouer Israel , and ouer Iudah .
And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada answered the King , and said , Amen : The Lord God of my lord the king say so too .
As the Lord hath bene with my lord the King , euen so be he with Solomon , and make his throne greater then the throne of my lord King Dauid .
So Zadok the Priest , and Nathan the Prophet , and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites went downe , and caused Solomon to ride vpon King Dauids mule , and brought him to Gihon .
And Zadok the Priest tooke an horne of oile out of the Tabernacle , and anointed Solomon : and they blew the trumpet , and all the people said , God saue King Solomon .
And all the people came vp after him , and the people piped with pipes , and reioyced with great ioy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
¶ And Adoniiah and all the ghests that were with him , heard it as they had made an end of eating : and when Ioab heard the sound of the trumpet , hee said , Wherefore is this noise of the citie , being in an vproare ?
And while hee yet spake , behold , Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar the Priest came , and Adoniiah sayde vnto him , Come in , for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
And Ionathan answered , and said to Adoniiah , Uerily our lorde king Dauid hath made Solomon king .
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the Priest , and Nathan the Prophet , and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they haue caused him to ride vpon the kings mule .
And Zadok the Priest , and Nathan the Prophet haue anointed him king in Gihon : and they are come vp from thence reioycing , so that the citie rang againe : this is the noyse that yee haue heard .
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdome .
And moreouer , the kings seruants came to blesse our lorde king Dauid , saying , God make the name of Solomon better then thy name , and make his throne greater then thy throne . And the king bowed himselfe vpon the bed .
And also thus sayde the King , Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which hath giuen one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes euen seeing it .
And all the guests that were with Adoniiah , were afraid , and rose vp , and went euery man his way .
¶ And Adoniiah feared because of Solomon , and arose , and went , and caught hold on the hornes of the Altar .
And it was tolde Solomon , saying , Behold , Adoniiah feareth King Solomon : for loe , he hath caught hold on the hornes of the Altar , saying , Let King Solomon sweare vnto mee to day , that hee will not slay his seruant with the sword .
And Solomon sayd , If hee will shewe himselfe a worthy man , there shall not an haire of him fall to the earth : but if wickednesse shall be found in him , he shall die .
<NON-VERSE>
Now the dayes of Dauid drew nigh , that he should die , and he charged Solomon his sonne , saying ;
I goe the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and shew thy selfe a man .
And keepe the charge of the Lord thy God , to walke in his wayes , to keepe his Statutes , and his Commandements , & his Iudgements , and his Testimonies , as it is written in the Law of Moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest , and whithersoeuer thou turnest thy selfe :
That the Lord may continue his word which hee spake concerning me , saying , If thy children take heede to their way , to walke before mee in trueth , with all their heart , and with all their soule , there shall not faile thee ( sayd hee ) a man on the throne of Israel .
Moreouer thou knowest also what Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah did to mee , and what he did to the two captaines of the hostes of Israel , vnto Abner the sonne of Ner , and vnto Amasa the sonne of Iether , whom hee slewe , and shed the blood of warre in peace , and put the blood of warre vpon his girdle that was about his loynes , and in his shooes that were on his feet .
Doe therefore according to thy wisedome , and let not his hoare head goe downe to the graue in peace .
But shewe kindnesse vnto the sonnes of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those that eate at thy table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother .
And behold , thou hast with thee Shimei the sonne of Gera , a Beniamite of Bahurim , which cursed mee with a grieuous curse , in the day when I went to Mahanaim : but hee came downe to meete me at Iordane , and I sware to him by the Lord , saying , I will not put thee to death with the sword .
Nowe therefore holde him not guiltlesse : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to doe vnto him , but his hoare head bring thou downe to the graue with blood .
So Dauid slept with his fathers , and was buried in the citie of Dauid .
And the dayes that Dauid raigned ouer Israel , were fourty yeeres : seuen yeeres raigned hee in Hebron , and thirty and three yeeres raigned hee in Ierusalem .
¶ Then sate Solomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father , and his kingdome was established greatly .
¶ And Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon , and she said , Commest thou peaceably ? And he said , Peaceably .
He said moreouer , I haue somewhat to say vnto thee . And she saide , Say on .
And he said , Thou knowest that the kingdome was mine , and that all Israel set their faces on me , that I should raigne : howbeit the kingdome is turned about , and is become my brothers : for it was his from the Lord .
And now I aske one petition of thee , deny me not . And she saide vnto him , Say on .
And hee saide , Speake , I pray thee , vnto Solomon the king ( for hee will not say thee nay ) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife .
And Bathsheba said , Wel , I will speake for thee vnto the king .
¶ Bathsheba therefore went vnto king Solomon , to speake vnto him for Adoniiah : and the king rose vp to meete her , and bowed himselfe vnto her , and sate downe on his throne , and caused a seate to bee set for the Kings mother , and she sate on his right hand .
Then she said , I desire one small petition of thee , I pray thee say me not nay : and the King said vnto her , Aske on , my mother , for I will not say thee nay .
And she saide , Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adoniiah thy brother to wife .
And king Solomon answered , and said vnto his mother , And why doest thou aske Abishag the Shunammite for Adoniiah ? Aske for him the kingdome also ( for he is mine elder brother ) euen for him , and for Abiathar the Priest , & for Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah .
Then king Solomon sware by the Lord , saying , God doe so to me , and more also , if Adoniiah haue not spoken this word against his owne life .
Now therefore as the Lord liueth , which hath established mee , and set mee on the throne of Dauid my father , and who hath made me an house as he promised , Adoniiah shall be put to death this day .
And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and he fell vpon him that he died .
¶ And vnto Abiathar the Priest saide the King , Get thee to Anathoth , vnto thine own fields , for thou art worthy of death : but I will not at this time put thee to death , because thou barest the arke of the Lord God before Dauid my father , and because thou hast bene afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted .
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from beeing Priest vnto the Lord : that hee might fulfill the word of the Lord , which hee spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
¶ Then tidings came to Ioab ( for Ioab had turned after Adoniiah , though hee turned not after Absalom ) and Ioab fled vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the hornes of the Altar .
And it was told king Solomon that Ioab was fled vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord , and behold , hee is by the Altar : Then Solomon sent Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , saying , Goe fall vpon him .
And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord , and said vnto him , Thus saith the king , Come foorth . And he said , Nay , but I will die heere . And Benaiah brought the king word againe , saying , Thus said Ioab , and thus he answered me .
And the king saide vnto him , Doe as he hath said , and fall vpon him , and bury him , that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Ioab shed , from mee , and from the house of my father .
And the Lord shall returne his blood vpon his owne head , who fell vpon two men , more righteous and better then hee , and slew them with the sword , my father Dauid not knowing thereof , to wit , Abner the sonne of Ner , captaine of the hoste of Israel , and Amasa the sonne of Iether , captaine of the hoste of Iudah .
Their blood shall therefore returne vpon the head of Ioab , and vpon the head of his seed for euer : but vpon Dauid , and vpon his seede , and vpon his house , and vpon his throne , shall there bee peace for euer from the Lord .
So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp , and fell vpon him , and slewe him , and hee was buried in his owne house in the wildernesse .
¶ And the king put Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada in his roome ouer the hoste , and Zadok the Priest did the king put in the roume of Abiathar .
¶ And the king sent , and called for Shimei , and said vnto him , Build thee an house in Ierusalem , and dwell there , and goe not forth thence any whither .
For it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , & passest ouer the brooke Kidron , thou shalt know for certaine , that thou shalt surely die : thy blood shal be vpon thine owne head .
And Shimei said vnto the King , The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said , so will thy seruant doe . And Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many dayes .
And it came to passe at the end of three yeeres , that two of the seruants of Shimei ranne away vnto Achish sonne of Maachah king of Gath : and they told Shimei , saying , Beholde , thy seruants be in Gath .
And Shimei arose , and sadled his asse , and went to Gath to Achish , to seeke his seruants : and Shimei went and brought his seruants from Gath .
And it was told Solomon , that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath , and was come againe .
And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said vnto him , Did I not make thee to sweare by the Lord , and protested vnto thee , saying , Know for a certaine , that on the day thou goest out , and walkest abroad any whither , that thou shalt surely die ? And thou saidest vnto me , The word that I haue heard , is good .
Why then hast thou not kept the Oath of the Lord , and the commandement that I haue charged thee with ?
The king said moreuer to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickednesse which thine heart is priuie to , that thou diddest to Dauid my father : therefore the Lord shall returne thy wickednesse vpon thine owne head .
And king Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of Dauid shall bee established before the Lord for euer .

And Solomon made affinitie with Pharaoh king of Egypt , and tooke Pharaohs daughter , and brought her into the citie of Dauid , vntill he had made an end of building his owne house , and the house of the Lord , and the wall of Ierusalem round about .
Only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built vnto the Name of the Lord vntill those dayes .
And Solomon loued the Lord , walking in the statutes of Dauid his father : onely he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places .
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer vp on that Altar .
¶ In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dreame by night : and God sayd , Aske what I shall giue thee .
And Solomon said , Thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant Dauid my father great mercy , according as he walked before thee in trueth , and in righteousnesse , and in vprightnesse of heart with thee , and thou hast kept for him this great kindnesse , that thou hast giuen him a sonne to sit on his throne , as it is this day .
And now , O Lord my God , thou hast made thy seruant King in stead of Dauid my father : and I am but a litle childe : I know not how to goe out or come in .
And thy seruant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen , a great people , that cannot be numbred , nor counted for multitude .
Giue therefore thy seruant an understanding heart , to iudge thy people , that I may discerne betweene good and bad : for who is able to iudge this thy so great a people ?
And the speach pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
And God said vnto him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thy selfe long life , neither hast asked riches for thy selfe , nor hast asked the life of thine enemies , but hast asked for thy selfe vnderstanding to discerne iudgement ;
Behold , I haue done according to thy word : loe , I haue giuen thee a wise and an vnderstanding heart , so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like vnto thee .
And I haue also giuen thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the Kings like vnto thee , all thy dayes .
And if thou wilt walke in my wayes , to keepe my Statutes and my Commandements , as thy father Dauid did walke , then I will lengthen thy dayes .
And Solomon awoke , and behold , it was a dreame : and he came to Ierusalem , and stood before the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , and offered vp burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his seruants .
¶ Then came there two women that were harlots , vnto the king , and stood before him .
And the one woman said , O my lord , I and this woman dwell in one house , and I was deliuered of a childe , with her in the house .
And it came to passe the third day after that I was deliuered , that this woman was deliuered also : and wee were together ; there was no stranger with vs in the house , saue we two in the house .
And this womans childe died in the night : because she ouerlaid it .
And shee arose at midnight , and tooke my sonne from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and layd it in her bosome , and layd her dead childe in my bosome .
And when I rose in the morning to giue my childe sucke , behold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , beholde , it was not my sonne , which I did beare . And the other woman said , Nay , but the liuing is my sonne , and the dead is thy sonne : And this said , No , but the dead is thy sonne , and the liuing is my sonne . Thus they spake before the king .
Then said the King , The one saith , This is my sonne , that liueth , and thy sonne is the dead : and the other saith Nay : but thy sonne is the dead , and my sonne is the liuing .
And the King said , Bring mee a sword . And they brought a sword before the king :
And the king said , Diuide the liuing childe in two , and giue halfe to the one , and halfe to the other .
Then spake the woman whose the liuing childe was , vnto the king , ( for her bowels yerned vpon her sonne ) and she said , O my lord , giue her the liuing childe , and in no wise slay it : But the other said , Let it be neither mine nor thine , but diuide it .
Then the King answered and said , Giue her the liuing child , and in no wise slay it : she is the mother thereof .

So King Solomon was king ouer all Israel .
And these were the Princes which he had , Azariah the sonne of Zadok , the Priest ,
Elihoreph , and Ahiah the sonnes of Shisha , Scribes : Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud the Recorder ;
And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the host : And Zadok and Abiathar were the Priests :
And Azariah the sonne of Nathan was ouer the officers : and Zabud the sonne of Nathan was principall officer , and the kings friend .
And Ahishar was ouer the houshold : and Adoniram the sonne of Abda was ouer the tribute .
¶ And Solomon had twelue officers ouer all Israel , which prouided victuals for the king and his houshold : each man his moneth in a yeere made prouision .
And these are their names : the sonne of Hur in mount Ephraim ,
The sonne of Dekar in Makaz , and in Shaalbim , and Bethshemesh , and Elon - Bethhanan .
The sonne of Heseb in Aruboth , to him pertained Sochoh , and all the land of Hepher ;
The sonne of Abinadab in all the region of Dor , which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife :
Baana the sonne of Ahilud , to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth - shean , which is by Zartanah beneath Iezreel , from Beth - shean to Abel - Meholah , euen vnto the place that is beyond Iokneam :
The sonne of Geber in Ramoth Gilead , to him pertained the townes of Iair the sonne of Manasseh , which are in Gilead : to him also pertained the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , threescore great cities , with walles , and brasen barres .
Ahinadab the sonne of Iddo had Mahanaim .
Ahimaaz was in Naphtali ; he also tooke Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife .
Baanah the sonne of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth : Iehoshaphat the sonne of Paruah in Issachar :
Shimei the sonne of Elah in Beniamin :
Geber the sonne of Uri was in the countrey of Gilead , in the countrey of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and hee was the onely officer which was in the land .
¶ Iudah and Israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merrie .
And Solomon reigned ouer all kingdoms from the riuer vnto the land of the Philistines , and vnto the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and serued Solomon all the dayes of his life .
¶ And Solomons prouision for one day , was thirtie measures of fine floure , and threescore measures of meale ,
Ten fat oxen , and twentie oxen out of the pastures , and an hundred sheepe , beside Harts , and Roe - buckes , and fallow Deere , and fatted foule .
For he had dominion ouer all the region on this side the Riuer , from Tiphsah euen to Azzah ouer all the kings on this side the Riuer : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
And Iudah and Israel dwelt safely , euery man vnder his Uine , and vnder his Figtree , from Dan euen to Beer - sheba , all the dayes of Solomon .
¶ And Solomon had fourtie thousand stalles of horses for his charets , and twelue thousand horsemen .
And those officers prouided victuall for king Solomon , and for all that came vnto king Solomons table , euery man in his moneth : they lacked nothing .
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries , brought they vnto the place where the officers were , euery man according to his charge .
¶ And God gaue Solomon wisdome , and vnderstanding , exceeding much , and largenesse of heart , euen as the sand that is on the sea shoare .
And Solomons wisedome excelled the wisedome of all the children of the East countrey , and all the wisedome of Egypt .
For hee was wiser then all men ; then Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Chalcol , and Darda the sonnes of Mahol : and his fame was in all nations round about .
And he spake three thousand prouerbes : and his songs were a thousand and fiue .
And hee spake of trees , from the Cedar tree that is in Lebanon , euen vnto the Hyssope that springeth out of the wall : hee spake also of beasts , and of foule , and of creeping things , and of fishes .

And Hiram king of Tyre sent his seruants vnto Solomon : ( for hee had heard that they had anointed him King in the roume of his father , ) for Hiram was euer a louer of Dauid .
And Solomon sent to Hiram , saying ,
Thou knowest how that Dauid my father could not build an house vnto the Name of the Lord his God , for the warres which were about him on euery side , vntill the Lord put them vnder the soles of his feet .
But now the Lord my God hath giuen me rest on euery side , so that there is neither aduersary , nor euill occurrent .
And behold , I purpose to build an house vnto the Name of the Lord my God , as the Lord spake vnto Dauid my father , saying , Thy sonne , whom I will set vpon thy throne in thy roume , he shall build an house vnto my Name .
Now therefore command thou , that they hew me Cedar trees out of Lebanon , and my seruants shall bee with thy seruants : and vnto thee will I giue hire for thy seruants , according to all that thou shalt appoint : for thou knowest that there is not among vs , any that can skill to hew timber , like vnto the Sidonians .
¶ And it came to passe when Hiram heard the wordes of Solomon , that hee reioyced greatly , and said , Blessed be the Lord this day , which hath giuen vnto Dauid a wise sonne ouer this great people .
And Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , I haue considered the things which thou sentest to me for : and I will doe all thy desire concerning timber of Cedar , and concerning timber of firre .
My seruants shall bring them downe from Lebanon vnto the Sea : and I wil conuey them by sea in flotes , vnto the place that thou shalt appoint me , and will cause them to be discharged there , and thou shalt receiue them : and thou shalt accomplish my desire , in giuing food for my houshold .
So Hiram gaue Solomon Cedar trees , and Firre trees , according to all his desire .
And Solomon gaue Hiram twentie thousand measures of wheate for food to his houshold , and twentie measures of pure oile : thus gaue Solomon to Hiram yeere by yeere .
And the Lord gaue Solomon wisedome , as hee promised him : and there was peace betweene Hiram and Solomon , and they two made a league together .
¶ And King Solomon raised a leuie out of all Israel , and the leuie was thirtie thousand men .
And hee sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a moneth by courses : a moneth they were in Lebanon , and two moneths at home : and Adoniram was ouer the leuie .
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens , and fourescore thousand hewers in the mountaines :
Besides the chiefe of Solomons officers which were ouer the worke , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled ouer the people that wrought in the worke .
And the king commanded , and they brought great stones , costly stones , and hewed stones , to lay the foundation of the house .

And it came to passe in the foure hundred and fourescore yeere after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth yere of Solomons reigne ouer Israel , in the moneth Zif , which is the second moneth , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
And the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubites , and the breadth thereof twentie cubits , and the height thereof thirtie cubites .
And the porch before the Temple of the house : twentie cubites was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house , and tenne cubites was the breadth thereof before the house .
And for the house he made windowes of narrow lights .
¶ And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walles of the house round about , both of the Temple and of the Oracle : and hee made chambers round about .
The nethermost chamber was fiue cubites broad , and the middle was sixe cubites broad , and the third was seuen cubites broad : for without in the wall of the house hee made narrowed rests round about , that the beames should not bee fastened in the walles of the house .
And the house when it was in building , was built of stone , made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe , nor any toole of yron heard in the house , while it was in building .
The doore for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went vp with winding staires into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
So he built the house and finished it : and couered the house with beams and boards of Cedar .
And then hee built chambers against all the house , fiue cubites high : and they rested on the house with timber of Cedar .
¶ And the word of the Lord came to Solomon , saying ;
Concerning this House which thou art in building , if thou wilt walke in my Statutes , and execute my Iudgments , and keepe all my Commandements to walke in them : then will I performe my word with thee , which I spake vnto Dauid thy father .
And hee built the walles of the house within with boards of Cedar , both the floore of the house , and the walles of the sieling : and hee couered them on the inside with wood , and couered the floore of the house with plankes of firre .
And hee built twentie cubites on the sides of the house , both the floore , and the walles with boards of Cedar : he euen built them for it within , euen for the Oracle , euen for the most holy place .
And the house , that is , the Temple before it , was fortie cubites long .
And the Cedar of the house within was carued with knops , and open flowres : all was Cedar , there was no stone seene .
And the Oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord .
And the Oracle in the forepart , was twenty cubits in length and twentie cubites in breadth , and twentie cubites in the height thereof : and hee ouerlayd it with pure golde , and so couered the Altar which was of Cedar . So Solomon ouerlayd the house within with pure golde : and he made a partition , by the chaines of golde before the Oracle , and he ouerlaid it with gold .
And the whole house he ouerlaid with golde vntill he had finished all the house : also the whole Altar that was by the Oracle he ouerlaide with golde . ¶ And within the Oracle he made two Cherubims of Oliue tree , each ten cubites high .
The height of the one Cherub was ten cubites , and so was it of the other Cherub .
And he set the Cherubims within the inner house : and they stretched foorth the wings of the Cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other Cherub touched the other wall : & their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
And he ouerlayd the Cherubims with golde .
And he carued all the walles of the house round about with carued figures of Cherubims , and palme trees , and open flowers , within & without . And the floore of the house hee ouerlayed with gold , within and without .
¶ And for the entring of the Oracle he made doores of Oliue tree : the lintell and side posts were a fifth part of the wall .
The two doores also were of Oliue tree , and he carued vpon them caruings of Cherubims , and palme trees , and open flowers , and ouerlayd them with gold , and spread gold vpon the Cherubims , and vpon the palme trees . So also made hee for the doore of the Temple postes of Oliue tree a fourth part of the wall .
And the two doores were of firre tree : the two leaues of the one doore were folding , and the two leaues of the other doore were folding .
And he carued thereon Cherubims , and palme trees , and open flowers : and couered them with gold , fitted vpon the carued worke .
¶ And hee built the inner Court with three rowes of hewed stone , and a row of Cedar beames .
But Solomon was building his owne house thirteene yeres , and he finished all his house . ¶ Hee built also the house of the forrest of Lebanon ; the length thereof was a hundred cubites , and the breadth thereof fiftie cubites , and the height thereof thirtie cubites , vpon foure rowes of Cedar pillars , with Cedar beames vpon the pillars .
¶ And he made a porch of pillars , the length thereof was fiftie cubites , and the breadth thereof thirtie cubites : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars , and the thicke beame were before them . ¶ Then hee made a porch for the throne where he might iudge , euen the porch of Iudgement : and it was couered with Cedar from one side of the floore to the other .
¶ And his house where he dwelt , had another court within the porch , which was of the like worke : Solomon made also an house for Pharaohs daughter , ( whom he had taken to wife ) like vnto this porch .
All these were of costly stones , according to the measures of hewed stones , sawed with sawes , within and without , euen from the foundation vnto the coping , and so on the outside toward the great court .
And the foundation was of costly stones , euen great stones ; stones of ten cubites , and stones of eight cubites .
And aboue were costly stones ( after the measures of hewed stones ) and Cedars .
And the great court round about , was with three rowes of hewed stones , and a row of Cedar beames , both for the inner court of the house of the Lord , and for the porch of the house .
¶ And king Solomon sent and fet Hiram out of Tyre .
And the chapiters vpon the two pillars had pomegranates also , aboue , ouer against the belly which was by the networke : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rowes round about , vpon the other chapiter .
And he set vp the pillars in the porch of the temple : and hee set vp the right pillar , and called the name therof Iachin : and he set vp the left pillar , and called the name thereof Boaz .
And vpon the top of the pillars was lillie worke : so was the worke of the pillars finished .
¶ And he made a moulten Sea , ten cubites from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , & his height was fiue cubits : and a line of thirtie cubites did compasse it round about .
And vnder the brimme of it round about there were knops compassing it , ten in a cubite , compassing the sea round about : the knops were cast in two rowes , when it was cast .
It stood vpon twelue oxen , three looking toward the North , and three looking toward the West , and three looking toward the South , and three looking toward the East : and the Sea was set aboue vpon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
And it was an hand breadth thicke , and the brimme thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowres of lillies : it contained two thousand Baths .
¶ And he made ten bases of brasse ; foure cubites was the length of one base , and foure cubites the breadth thereof , and three cubites the height of it . And the worke of the bases was on this maner : they had borders , and the borders were betweene the ledges :
And on the borders that were betweene the ledges were lyons , oxen , and Cherubims : and vpon the ledges there was a base aboue : and beneath the lyons and oxen were certaine additions made of thinne worke .
And euery base had foure brasen wheeles , and plates of brasse : and the foure corners therof had vndersetters : vnder the lauer were vndersetters molten , at the side of euery addition . And the mouth of it within the chapiter , and aboue , was a cubite : but the mouth thereof was round after the worke of the base , a cubite and an halfe : and also vpon the mouth of it were grauings with their borders , foure square not round .
And there were foure vndersetters to the foure corners of one base : and the vndersetters were of the very base it selfe .
And in the top of the base was there a round compasse of halfe a cubite high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof , and the borders thereof were of the same .
For on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graued Cherubims , lions , and palme trees , according to the proportion of euery one , and additions round about .
After this maner he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size .
¶ Then made hee ten lauers of brasse : one lauer conteined fourtie baths : and euery lauer was foure cubites , and vpon euery one of the ten bases , one lauer .
And he put fiue bases on the right side of the house , and fiue on the left side of the house : and he set the Sea on the right side of the house Eastward , ouer against the South .
¶ And Hiram made the lauers , and the shouels , and the basons : So Hiram made an ende of doing all the worke that hee made King Solomon , for the house of the Lord .
The two pillars , and the two bowles of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars : and the two networkes , to couer the two bowles of the chapiters which were vpon the top of the pillars :
And foure hundred Pomegranates for the two networkes , euen two rowes of Pomegranates for one networke , to couer the two bowles of the chapiters that were vpon the pillars :
And the ten bases , and ten lauers on the bases .
And one Sea , and twelue oxen vnder the Sea .
And the pots , and the shouels , and the basons : and all these vessels which Hiram made to King Solomon , for the house of the Lord , were of bright brasse .
In the plaine of Iordane did the king cast them in the clay ground , betweene Succoth and Zarthan .
And Solomon left all the vessels vnweighed , because they were exceeding many : neither was the weight of the brasse found out .
And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained vnto the house of the Lord : the Altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the Shewbread was :
And the candlesticks of pure gold , fiue on the right side , and fiue on the left , before the Oracle , with the flowers , and the lampes , and the tongs of gold ,
And the boules , and the snuffers , and the basons , & the spoones , and the censers of pure gold : and the hindges of gold , both for the doores of the inner house the most Holy place , and for the doores of the house , to wit , of the temple .

Then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chiefe of the fathers of the children of Israel , vnto king Solomon in Ierusalem , that they might bring vp the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , out of the citie of Dauid , which is Zion .
And all the men of Israel assembled themselues vnto king Solomon , at the feast , in the moneth Ethanim , which is the seuenth moneth .
And all the Elders of Israel came , and the Priests tooke vp the Arke .
And they brought vp the Arke of the Lord , and the Tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle , euen those did the Priests & the Leuites bring vp .
And king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled vnto him , were with him before the Arke , sacrificing sheepe , and oxen , that could not bee told nor numbred for multitude .
And the Priests brought in the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord vnto his place , into the Oracle of the house to the most holy place , euen vnder the wings of the Cherubims .
For the Cherubims spread forth their two wings ouer the place of the Arke , and the Cherubims couered the Arke , and the staues thereof aboue .
And they drew out the staues , that the ends of the staues were seene out in the Holy place before the Oracle , and they were not seene without : and there they are vnto this day .
There was nothing in the Arke , saue the two Tables of stone , which Moses put there at Horeb , when the Lord made a Couenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
And it came to passe when the Priests were come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of the Lord ;
So that the Priests could not stand to minister , because of the cloud : for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
¶ Then spake Solomon ; The Lord said that hee would dwell in the thicke darkenesse .
I haue surely built thee an house to dwel in , a setled place for thee to abide in for euer .
And the King turned his face about , and blessed all the Congregation of Israel : ( and all the Congregation of Israel stood . )
And he said , Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ;
Since the day that I brought foorth my people Israel out of Egypt , I chose no citie out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house that my Name might be therein ; but I chose Dauid to be ouer my people Israel .
And it was in the heart of Dauid my father , to builde an house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel .
And the Lord sayd vnto Dauid my father , Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house vnto my Name , thou diddest well that it was in thine heart .
Neuerthelesse , thou shalt not build the house , but thy sonne that shall come foorth out of thy loynes , hee shall build the house vnto my Name .
And the Lord hath perfourmed his word that he spake , and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and haue built an House for the Name of the Lord God of Israel .
And I haue set there a place for the Arke , wherein is the Couenant of the Lord , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
¶ And Solomon stood before the Altar of the Lord , in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel , and spread foorth his handes toward heauen :
And hee said , Lord God of Israel , there is no God like thee , in heauen aboue , or on earth beneath , who keepest couenant and mercy with thy seruants , that walke before thee with all their heart :
Who hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
Therefore now Lord God of Israel , keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father , that thou promisedst him , saying ; There shall not faile thee a man in my sight to sit on the Throne of Israel ; so that thy children take heede to their way , that they walke before me as thou hast walked before me :
And now , O God of Israel , let thy worde ( I pray thee ) bee verified , which thou spakest vnto thy seruant Dauid my father .
But will God indeede dwell on the earth ? Behold , the heauen , and heauen of heauens cannot conteine thee : how much lesse this House that I haue builded ?
Yet haue thou respect vnto the prayer of thy seruant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken vnto the crie and to the prayer , which thy seruant prayeth before thee to day :
That thine eyes may be open toward this house , night and day , euen toward the place of which thou hast said , My Name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken vnto the prayer which thy seruant shall make towards this place .
And hearken thou to the supplication of thy seruant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray towards this place : and heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place , and when thou hearest , forgiue .
¶ If any man trespasse against his neighbour , and an oath be laid vpon him to cause him to sweare , and the oath come before thine Altar in this house :
Then heare thou in heauen , and doe , and iudge thy seruants , condemning the wicked to bring his way vpon his head , and iustifying the righteous , to giue him according to his righteousnesse .
¶ When thy people Israel bee smitten downe before the enemie , because they haue sinned against thee , and shall turne againe to thee , and confesse thy Name , and pray , and make supplication vnto thee in this house :
Then heare thou in heauen , and forgiue the sinne of thy people Israel , and bring them againe vnto the land , which thou gauest vnto their fathers .
¶ When heauen is shut vp , and there is no raine , because they haue sinned against thee : if they pray towards this place , and confesse thy Name , and turne from their sinne , when thou afflictest them :
Then heare thou in heauen , and forgiue the sinne of thy seruants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walke , and giue raine vpon thy land which thou hast giuen to thy people for an inheritance .
¶ If there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blasting , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpiller : if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities , whatsoeuer plague , whatsoeuer sicknes there be ;
What prayer and supplication soeuer be made by any man , or by all thy people Israel , which shall know euery man the plague of his owne heart , and spread forth his handes towards this house :
Then heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place , and forgiue , and do , and giue to euery man according to his wayes , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , euen thou onely knowest the hearts of all the children of men , )
That they may feare thee all the dayes that they liue , in the land which thou gauest vnto our fathers .
Moreouer , concerning a stranger that is not of thy people Israel , but commeth out of a farre countrey , for thy Names sake ;
( For they shall heare of thy great Name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arme ) when hee shall come and pray towards this house :
Heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place , and doe according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for : that all people of the earth may know thy Name , to feare thee , as doe thy people Israel , and that they may know that this house which I haue builded , is called by thy Name .
¶ If thy people goe out to battell against their enemie , whithersoeuer thou shalt send them , and shall pray vnto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I haue built for thy Name :
Then heare thou in heauen their prayer & their supplication , and mainteine their cause .
If they sinne against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliuer them to the enemy , so that they cary them away captiues , vnto the land of the enemy , farre or neere ;
Yet if they shall bethinke themselues , in the land whither they were caried captiues , and repent , and make supplication vnto thee in the land of them that caried them captiues , saying , Wee haue sinned , and haue done peruersly , we haue committed wickednes ;
And so returne vnto thee with all their heart , and with all their soule , in the land of their enemies , which led them away captiue , and pray vnto thee toward their land , which thou gauest vnto their fathers , the city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I haue built for thy Name :
Then heare thou their prayer and their supplication in heauen thy dwelling place , and mainteine their cause ,
And forgiue thy people that haue sinned against thee , and all their transgressions , wherein they haue transgressed against thee , and giue them compassion before them who caried them captiue , that they may haue compassion on them :
For they bee thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest foorth out of Egypt , from the mids of the furnace of iron :
That thine eyes may be open vnto the supplication of thy seruant , and vnto the supplication of thy people Israel , to hearken vnto them in all that they call for vnto thee .
For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy seruant , when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord God .
And it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication vnto the Lord , he arose from before the Altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees , with his handes spread vp to heauen .
And he stood , and blessed all the Congregation of Israel , with a lowd voice , saying ;
Blessed be the Lord , that hath giuen rest vnto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his seruant .
The Lord our God be with vs , as he was with our fathers : let him not leaue vs , nor forsake vs :
That hee may encline our hearts vnto him , to walke in all his wayes , and to keepe his Commaundements , and his Statutes , and his Iudgements which hee commaunded our fathers .
And let these my wordes wherewith I haue made supplication before the Lord , be nigh vnto the Lord our God , day and night , that hee maintaine the cause of his seruant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God : and that there is none else .
Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord your God , to walke in his Statutes , and to keepe his Commandements , as at this day .
¶ And the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifice before the Lord .
And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered vnto the Lord , two and twentie thousand oxen , and an hundred and twentie thousand sheepe : so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
The same day did the king hallow the middle of the Court that was before the house of the Lord : for there hee offered burnt offerings , and meat offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings : because the brasen Altar that was before the Lord , was too little to receiue the burnt offerings , and meat offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings .
And at that time Solomon held a feast , and all Israel with him , a great Congregation , from the entring in of Hamath , vnto the riuer of Egypt , before the Lord our God , seuen dayes and seuen dayes , euen fourteene dayes .

And it came to passe , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the kings house , and all Solomons desire which hee was pleased to doe ,
That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time , as hee had appeared vnto him at Gibeon .
And the Lord said vnto him , I haue heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me : I haue hallowed this house which thou hast built , to put my Name there for euer , and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
And if thou wilt walke before me , as Dauid thy father walked , in integritie of heart , and in vprightnesse , to doe according to all that I haue commanded thee , and wilt keepe my Statutes , and my Iudgements :
Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer , as I promised to Dauid thy father , saying , There shall not faile thee a man vpon the throne of Israel .
But if you shall at all turne from following me , you or your children , and will not keepe my Commandements , and my Statutes , which I haue set before you , but goe and serue other gods , and worship them :
Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I haue giuen them ; and this house which I haue hallowed for my Name , will I cast out of my sight , and Israel shall bee a prouerbe , and a by - word among all people :
And at this house which is high , euery one that passeth by it , shalbe astonished , and shall hisse , and they shal say , Why hath the Lord done thus vnto this land , and to this house ?
And they shall answere , Because they forsooke the Lord their God , who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt , and haue taken hold vpon other gods , and haue worshipped them , and serued them : therefore hath the Lord brought vpon them all this euill .
¶ And it came to passe at the end of twentie yeeres , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the Kings house ,
( Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with Cedar trees , and firre trees , and with golde according to al his desire ) that then Solomon gaue Hiram twentie cities in the land of Galile .
And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had giuen him , and they pleased him not .
And he said , What cities are these which thou hast giuen me , my brother ? And he called them the land of Cabul vnto this day .
And Hiram sent to the king sixe score talents of gold .
¶ And this is the reason of the leuie which king Solomon raised , for to build the house of the Lord , and his owne house , and Millo , and the wall of Ierusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone vp , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slaine the Canaanites that dwelt in the citie , and giuen it for a present vnto his daughter Solomons wife .
And Solomon built Gezer , and Beth - horon the nether ,
And Baalath , and Tadmor in the wildernesse , in the land .
And all the cities of store that Solomon had , and cities for his charets , and cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon disired to build in Ierusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion . And all the people that were left of the Amorites , Hittittes , Perizzites , Hiuites , and Iebusites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
Their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able vtterly to destroy , vpon those did Solomon leuie a tribute of bond - seruice vnto this day .
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of warre , and his seruants , and his princes , and his captaines , and rulers of his charets , and his horsemen .
These were the chiefe of the officers that were ouer Solomons worke , fiue hundred and fiftie , which bare rule ouer the people that wrought in the worke .
¶ But Pharaohs daughter came vp out of the citie of Dauid , vnto her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Millo .
¶ And three times in a yeere did Solomon offer burnt offerings , and peace offerings vpon the Altar which he built vnto the Lord , and he burnt incense vpon the altar that was before the Lord : so he finished the house .
¶ And king Solomon made a nauie of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shoare of the red sea , in the land of Edom .
And Hiram sent in the nauie his seruants , shipmen that had knowledge of the Sea , with the seruants of Solomon .

And when the Queene of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon , concerning the Name of the Lord ; shee came to prooue him with hard questions .
And she came to Ierusalem with a very great traine , with camels that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when shee was come to Solomon , she communed with him , of all that was in her heart .
And Solomon tolde her all her questions : there was not any thing hid from the king , which hee told her not .
And when the Queene of Sheba had seene all Solomons wisedome , and the house that he had built ,
And the meat of his table , and the sitting of his seruants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparell , and his cup bearers , and his ascent by which hee went vp vnto the house of the Lord : there was no more spirit in her .
And she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine owne land , of thy actes and of thy wisedome .
Howbeit , I beleeued not the words , vntill I came and mine eyes had seene it : and beholde , the halfe was not told me : thy wisedom and prosperitie exceedeth the fame which I heard .
Happie are thy men , happy are these thy seruants , which stand continually before thee , and that heare thy wisedom .
Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel ; because the Lord loued Israel for euer , therefore made he thee King , to doe iudgement and iustice .
And she gaue the king an hundred and twentie talents of gold , and of spices very great store , & precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices , as these , which the Queene of Sheba gaue to king Solomon .
And the nauie also of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir , great plentie of Almug trees , and precious stones .
And the king made of the Almug trees , pillars for the house of the Lord , and for the Kings house , Harpes also and Psalteries for singers : there came no such Almug trees , nor were seene vnto this day .
And king Solomon gaue vnto the Queene of Sheba , al her desire whatsoeuer she asked , besides that which Solomon gaue her of his royall bountie : so she turned and went to her owne countrey , she and her seruants . ¶ Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one yere , was sixe hundred , threescore & six talents of gold ,
Besides that he had of the merchant men , and of the traffique of the spicemerchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the gouernours of the countrey .
¶ And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten golde : sixe hundred shekels of golde went to one target .
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold , three pound of gold went to one shield ; and the king put them in the house of the forrest of Lebanon .
¶ Moreouer the king made a great throne of yuorie , and ouerlaide it with the best gold .
The throne had sixe steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stayes on either side on the place of the seate , and two lyons stood beside the stayes .
And twelue lions stood there on the one side and on the other vpon the sixe steps : there was not the like made in any kingdome .
¶ And all king Solomons drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forrest of Lebanon were of pure gold , none were of siluer , it was nothing accounted of in the dayes of Solomon .
For the king had at sea a nauie of Tharshish , with the nauie of Hiram : once in three yeeres came the nauie of Tharshish , bringing golde and siluer , yuorie , and apes , and peacocks .
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth , for riches and for wisedome .
¶ And all the earth sought to Solomon , to heare his wisedom which God had put in his heart .
And they brought euery man his present , vessels of siluer , and vessels of gold , and garments , and armour , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate yeere by yeere .
¶ And Solomon gathered together charets and horsemen . And hee had a thousand and foure hundred charets , and twelue thousand horsemen , whom he bestowed in the cities for charets , and with the king at Ierusalem .

But King Solomon loued many strange women , ( together with the daughter of Pharaoh ) women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Sidonians & Hittites :
Of the nations concerning which the Lord said vnto the children of Israel , Yee shall not goe in to them , neither shall they come in vnto you , for surely they will turne away your heart after their gods : Solomon claue vnto these in loue .
And he had seuen hundred wiues , Princesses , and three hundred concubines : and his wiues turned away his heart .
For it came to passe when Solomon was old , that his wiues turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as was the heart of Dauid his father .
For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddesse of the Zidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Amorites .
And Solomon did euill in the sight of the Lord , and went not fully after the Lord , as did Dauid his father .
Then did Solomon build an hie place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , in the hill that is before Ierusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
And likewise did hee for all his strange wiues , which burnt incense and sacrificed vnto their gods .
¶ And the Lord was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared vnto him twise ,
And had commaunded him concerning this thing , that hee should not goe after other gods : but hee kept not that which the Lord commanded .
Wherefore the Lord said vnto Solomon ; Forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my Couenant , and my Statutes which I haue commanded thee , I wil surely rend the kingdome from thee , and will giue it to thy seruant .
Notwithstanding in thy dayes I wil not doe it , for Dauid thy fathers sake : but I wil rend it out of the hand of thy sonne .
Howbeit , I wil not rend away all the kingdome : but wil giue one tribe to thy sonne , for Dauid my seruants sake , and for Ierusalems sake , which I haue chosen .
¶ And the Lord stirred vp an aduersary vnto Solomon , Hadad the Edomite : hee was of the kings seed in Edom .
For it came to passe when Dauid was in Edom , and Ioab the captaine of the host was gone vp to bury the slaine , after he had smitten euery male in Edom :
( For sixe moneths did Ioab remaine there with all Israel , vntil hee had cut off euery male in Edom . )
That Hadad fled , he and certaine Edomites of his fathers seruants with him , to goe into Egypt : Hadad being yet a litle childe .
And they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran , and they tooke men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , vnto Pharaoh king of Egypt , which gaue him an house , and appointed him vitailes , and gaue him land .
And Hadad found great fauour in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gaue him to wife the sister of his owne wife , the sister of Tahpenes the Queene .
And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his sonne , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaohs house : and Genubath was in Pharaohs houshold among the sonnes of Pharaoh .
And when Hadad heard in Egypt that Dauid slept with his fathers , and that Ioab the captaine of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine owne countrey .
Then Pharaoh said vnto him , But what hast thou lacked with mee , that , behold , thou seekest to goe to thine owne countrey ? And hee answered , Nothing : Howbeit , let mee goe in any wise .
¶ And God stirred him vp another aduersary : Rezon , the sonne of Eliadah , which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah :
And he gathered men vnto him , and became captaine ouer a band , when Dauid slew them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and dwelt therein , and reigned in Damascus .
And he was an aduersarie to Israel all the dayes of Solomon , beside the mischiefe that Hadad did : and he abhorred Israel , and reigned ouer Syria .
¶ And Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , an Ephrathite of Zereda , Solomons seruant , ( whose mothers name was Zeruah a widow woman ) euen he lift vp his hand against the king .
And this was the cause that hee lift vp his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breaches of the citie of Dauid his father .
And the man Ieroboam was a mightie man of valour : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious , hee made him ruler ouer all the charge of the house of Ioseph .
And it came to passe at that time when Ieroboam went out of Ierusalem , that the Prophet Ahiiah the Shilonite found him in the way : and hee had clad himselfe with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
And Ahiiah caught the new garment that was on him , and rent it in twelue pieces .
And he said to Ieroboam , Take thee tenne pieces : for thus sayth the Lord the God of Israel , Behold , I will rent the kingdome out of the hand of Solomon , and will giue ten tribes to thee :
( But hee shall haue one tribe , for my seruant Dauids sake , and for Ierusalems sake , the citie which I haue chosen out of all the tribes of Israel : )
Because that they haue forsaken mee , and haue worshipped Ashtaroth the goddesse of the Zidonians , Chemosh the god of the Moabites , and Milcom the god of the children of Anunon , and haue not walked in my wayes , to doe that which is right in mine eyes , and to keepe my Statutes , and my Iudgements , as did Dauid his father .
Howbeit , I will not take the whole kingdome out of his hand : but I will make him Prince all the dayes of his life , for Dauid my seruants sake , whom I chose , because hee kept my Commandements and my Statutes :
But I will take the kingdome out of his sonnes hand , and will giue it vnto thee , euen ten tribes .
And vnto his sonne will I giue one tribe , that Dauid my seruant may haue a light alway before me in Ierusalem , the citie which I haue chosen me to put my Name there .
And I will take thee , and thou shalt reigne according to all that thy soule desireth , and shalt be King ouer Israel .
And it shall be , if thou wilt hearken vnto all that I command thee , and wilt walke in my wayes , and doe that is right in my sight , to keepe my Statutes and my Commandements , as Dauid my seruant did ; that I will be with thee , and build thee a sure house , as I built for Dauid , and will giue Israel vnto thee .
And I will for this afflict the seed of Dauid , but not for euer .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Ieroboam , and Ieroboam arose , and fledde into Egypt , vnto Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt vntill the death of Solomon .
¶ And the rest of the actes of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisedome , are they not written in the booke of the actes of Solomon ?
And the time that Solomon reigned in Ierusalem , ouer all Israel , was fourtie yeeres .
<NON-VERSE>
And Rehoboam went to Shechem : for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king .
And it came to passe when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it ( for hee was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Ieroboam dwelt in Egypt : )
That they sent , and called him : and Ieroboam and all the Congregation of Israel came , and spake vnto Rehoboam , saying ;
Thy father made our yoke grieuous : now therefore , make thou the grieuous seruice of thy father , and his heauy yoke which he put vpon vs , lighter , and we will serue thee .
And hee said vnto them , Depart yet for three daies , then come againe to me . And the people departed .
¶ And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father , while he yet liued , and said , How doe you aduise , that I may answere this people ?
And they spake vnto him , saying , If thou wilt be a seruant vnto this people this day , and wilt serue them , and answere them , and speake good words to them , then they will be thy seruants for euer .
But hee forsooke the counsell of the old men , which they had giuen him , and consulted with the yong men , that were growen vp with him , and which stood before him .
And hee said vnto them , What counsell giue ye , that we may answere this people , who haue spoken to mee , saying , Make the yoke which thy father did put vpon vs , lighter ?
And the young men that were growen vp with him , spake vnto him , saying , Thus shalt thou speake vnto this people that spake vnto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heauy , but make thou it lighter vnto vs ; thus shalt thou say vnto them , My litle finger shall bee thicker then my fathers loynes .
And now whereas my father did lade you with a heauy yoke , I wil adde to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whippes , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
¶ So Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed , saying , Come to me againe the third day .
And the king answered the people roughly , and forsooke the old mens counsell that they gaue him :
And spake to them after the counsell of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heauy , and I will adde to your yoke ; my father also chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
Wherefore the king hearkened not vnto the people : for the cause was from the Lord , that hee might performe his saying , which the Lord spake by Ahiiah the Shilonite vnto Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat .
¶ So when all Israel saw that the king hearkned not vnto them , the people answered the king , saying , What portion haue we in Dauid ? neither haue we inheritance in the sonne of Iesse : to your tents , O Israel : nowe see to thine owne house , Dauid . So Israel departed vnto their tents .
But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Iudah , Rehoboam reigned ouer them .
Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was ouer the tribute , and all Israel stoned him with stones that hee died : therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him vp to his charet , to flee to Ierusalem .
So Israel rebelled against the house of Dauid vnto this day .
And it came to passe when all Israel heard that Ieroboam was come againe , that they sent and called him vnto the Congregation , and made him king ouer all Israel : there was none that followed the house of Dauid , but the tribe of Iudah onely .
¶ And when Rehoboam was come to Ierusalem , hee assembled all the house of Iudah , with the tribe of Beniamin , an hundred and fourescore thousand chosen men which were warriers , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdome againe to Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon .
But the word of God came vnto Shemaiah , the man of God , saying ,
Speake vnto Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon king of Iudah , and vnto all the house of Iudah and Beniamin , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not goe vp , nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel : returne euery man to his house , for this thing is from me . They hearkened therefore to the word of the Lord , and returned to depart , according to the word of the Lord .
¶ Then Ieroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim , and dwelt therein , and went out from thence , and built Penuel .
And Ieroboam said in his heart , Now shall the kingdome returne to the house of Dauid :
If this people goe vp , to doe sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Ierusalem , then shall the heart of this people turne againe vnto their lorde , euen vnto Rehoboam king of Iudah , and they shall kill mee , and goe againe to Rehoboam king of Iudah .
Whereupon the king tooke counsell , and made two calues of gold , and said vnto them , It is too much for you to goe vp to Ierusalem : Behold thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt .
And he set the one in Bethel , and the other put he in Dan .
And this thing became a sinne : for the people went to worship before the one , euen vnto Dan .
And he made an house of hie places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sonnes of Leui .
And Ieroboam ordeined a feast in the eight moneth , on the fifteenth day of the moneth , like vnto the feast that is in Iudah , and he offered vpon the altar ( so did he in Bethel , ) sacrificing vnto the calues that he had made : and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made .
<NON-VERSE>
And behold , there came a man of God out of Iudah by the word of the Lord vnto Bethel : and Ieroboam stood by the altar to burne incense .
And hee cried against the altar in the word of the Lord , and said , O altar , altar , thus saith the Lord , Behold , a child shalbe borne vnto the house of Dauid , Iosiah by name , and vpon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burne incense vpon thee , and mens bones shall bee burnt vpon thee .
And he gaue a signe the same day , saying , This is the signe which the Lord hath spoken : Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are vpon it , shalbe powred out .
And it came to passe when king Ieroboam heard the saying of the man of God , which had cried against the altar in Bethel , that he put forth his hand from the altar , saying , Lay hold on him : And his hand which hee put foorth against him , dried vp , so that hee could not pull it in againe to him .
The altar also was rent , and the ashes powred out from the altar , according to the signe which the man of God had giuen by the word of the Lord .
And the king answered , and said vnto the man of God , Intreat now the face of the Lord thy God , and pray for mee , that my hand may be restored mee againe . And the man of God besought the Lord , and the kings hand was restored againe , and became as it was before .
And the king said vnto the man of God , Come home with mee , and refresh thy selfe , and I wil giue thee a reward .
And the man of God said vnto the king , If thou wilt giue mee halfe thine house , I will not goe in with thee , neither will I eat bread , nor drinke water in this place :
For so was it charged mee by the word of the Lord , saying , Eate no bread , nor drinke water , nor turne again by the same way that thou camest .
So he went another way , and returned not by the way that hee came to Bethel .
¶ Now there dwelt an old Prophet in Bethel , and his sonne came and told him all the workes that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which hee had spoken vnto the king , them they tolde also to their father .
And their father said vnto them , What way went he ? for his sonnes had seene what way the man of God went , which came from Iudah .
And hee saide vnto his sonnes , Saddle me the asse . So they sadled him the asse , and he rode thereon ,
And went after the man of God , and found him sitting vnder an oke ; and he said vnto him , Art thou the man of God that camest from Iudah ? And he said , I am .
Then hee said vnto him , Come home with me , and eate bread .
And he said , I may not returne with thee , nor goe in with thee : neither will I eat bread , nor drinke water with thee in this place .
For it was said to mee by the word of the Lord , Thou shalt eate no bread , nor drinke water there , nor turne againe to go by the way that thou camest .
He said vnto him , I am a prophet also as thou art , and an angel spake vnto me by the word of the Lord , saying , Bring him backe with thee into thine house , that he may eat bread , and drinke water : But he lied vnto him .
So he went backe with him , and did eate bread in his house , and dranke water .
¶ And it came to passe as they sate at the table , that the word of the Lord came vnto the prophet that brought him backe :
And he cried vnto the man of God that came from Iudah , saying , Thus saith the Lord , Forasmuch as thou hast disobeied the mouth of the Lord , and hast not kept the commandement which the Lord thy God commanded thee ,
But camest backe , and hast eaten bread , and drunke water , in the place , of the which the Lord did say to thee , Eate no bread , and drinke no water ; thy carcaise shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy fathers .
¶ And it came to passe after he had eaten bread , and after hee had drunke , that he sadled for him the asse , to wit , for the Prophet , whome hee had brought backe .
And when he was gone , a lyon met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcaise was cast in the way , and the asse stood by it , the lyon also stood by the carcaise .
And beholde , men passed by , and saw the carcaise cast in the way , and the lyon standing by the carcaise : and they came and told it in the citie where the old prophet dwelt .
And when the prophet that brought him back from the way , heard thereof , he said , It is the man of God , who was disobedient vnto the word of the Lord : therefore the Lord hath deliuered him vnto the lion , which hath torne him , and slaine him , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake vnto him .
And he spake to his sonnes , saying , Saddle me the asse : and they sadled him .
And he went and found his carcaise cast in the way , and the asse and the lyon standing by the carcaise : the lyon had not eaten the carcaise , nor torne the asse .
And the prophet tooke vp the carcaise of the man of God , and laid it vpon the asse , and brought it backe : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourne , and to burie him .
And hee laid his carcaise in his owne graue , and they mourned ouer him , saying , Alas my brother .
And it came to passe after hee had buried him , that he spake to his sonnes , saying , When I am dead , then bury me in the sepulchre , wherein the man of God is buried , lay my bones beside his bones .
For the saying which hee cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , shall surely come to passe .
¶ After this thing , Ieroboam returned not from his euill way , but made againe of the lowest of the people priests of the high places : whosoeuer would , he consecrated him , and he became one of the priests of the high places .

At that time Abiiah the sonne of Ieroboam fell sicke .
And Ieroboam said to his wife , Arise , I pray thee , and disguise thy selfe , that thou be not knowen to be the wife of Ieroboam : and get thee to Shiloh : Behold , there is Ahiiah the Prophet , which told mee that I should be king ouer this people .
And take with thee ten loaues , and cracknels , and a cruse of honie , and goe to him : he shall tell thee what shall become of the childe .
And Ieroboams wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahiiah : but Ahiiah could not see , for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Ahiiah , Behold , the wife of Ieroboam commeth to aske a thing of thee for her sonne , for hee is sicke : thus and thus shalt thou say vnto her : for it shall be when shee commeth in , that shee shall faine her selfe to be another woman .
And it was so , when Ahiiah heard the sound of her feet , as she came in at the doore , that hee said , Come in , thou wife of Ieroboam , why fainest thou thy selfe to be another ? for I am sent to thee with heauie tidings .
Goe , tell Ieroboam , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince ouer my people Israel ,
And rent the kingdome away from the house of Dauid , and gaue it thee : and yet thou hast not beene as my seruant Dauid , who kept my Commandements , and who followed mee with all his heart , to doe that onely which was right in mine eyes ,
But hast done euill aboue all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to prouoke me to anger , and hast cast me behinde thy backe :
Therefore behold , I will bring euill vpon the house of Ieroboam , and will cut off from Ieroboam , him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut vp and left in Israel , and will take away the remnant of the house of Ieroboam , as a man taketh away dung , till it be all gone .
Him that dieth of Ieroboam in the citie , shall the dogs eate : and him that dieth in the field , shall the foules of the aire eate : for the Lord hath spoken it .
Arise thou therefore , get thee to thine owne house : and when thy feete enter into the citie , the child shall die .
And all Israel shall mourne for him , and bury him : for he onely of Ieroboam shal come to the graue , because in him there is found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel , in the house of Ieroboam .
Moreouer , the Lord shall raise him vp a king ouer Israel , who shal cut off the house of Ieroboam that day : but what ? euen now .
For the Lord shall smite Israel , as a reede is shaken in the water , and hee shall root vp Israel out of this good land , which hee gaue to their fathers , and shall scatter them beyond the Riuer , because they haue made their groues , prouoking the Lord to anger .
And hee shall giue Israel vp , because of the sinnes of Ieroboam , who did sinne , & who made Israel to sinne .
¶ And Ieroboams wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah : and when shee came to the threshold of the doore , the child died .
And they buried him , and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the Lord , which hee spake by the hand of his seruant Ahiiah the Prophet .
And the rest of the actes of Ieroboam , how hee warred , and how hee reigned , behold , they are written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel .
And the dayes which Ieroboam reigned , were two and twentie yeeres : and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ And Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon reigned in Iudah : Rehoboam was fourtie and one yeeres olde when he began to reigne , and hee reigned seuenteene yeeres in Ierusalem , the citie which the Lord did chuse out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his Name there : and his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitesse .
And Iudah did euill in the sight of the Lord , and they prouoked him to iealousie with their sinnes which they had committed , aboue all that their fathers had done .
For they also built them high places , and images , and groues on euery high hill , and vnder euery greene tree .
And there were also Sodomites in the land , and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
¶ And it came to passe in the fift yeere of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came vp against Ierusalem :
And he tooke away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the kings house , hee euen tooke away all : and he tooke away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them vnto the hands of the chiefe of the guard , which kept the doore of the kings house .
And it was so , when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard bare them , and brought them backe into the guard - chamber .
¶ Nowe the rest of the actes of Rehoboam , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam all their dayes .
<NON-VERSE>
Nowe in the eighteenth yeere of king Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , reigned Abiiam ouer Iudah .
Three yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
And he walked in all the sinnes of his father , which hee had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of Dauid his father .
Neuerthelesse , for Dauids sake did the Lord his God giue him a lampe in Ierusalem , to set vp his sonne after him , and to establish Ierusalem :
Because Dauid did that which was right in the eies of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the daies of his life , saue onely in the matter of Uriiah the Hittite . And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam all the dayes of his life .
Now the rest of the actes of Abiiam , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah ? And there was warre betweene Abiiam and Ieroboam .
And Abiiam slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the citie of Dauid : and Asa his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ And in the twentieth yeere of Ieroboam king of Israel , reigned Asa ouer Iudah .
And forty and one yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
And Asa did that which was right in the eies of the Lord , as did Dauid his father .
And hee tooke away the Sodomites out of the land , and remooued all the idoles that his fathers had made .
And also Maachah his mother , euen her hee remoued from being Queene , because she had made an idole in a groue , and Asa destroyed her idole , and burnt it by the brooke Kidron .
But the high places were not remooued : neuerthelesse , Asa his heart was perfect with the Lord all his dayes .
And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himselfe had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , siluer , and gold , and vessels .
¶ And there was war betweene Asa and Baasha King of Israel all their dayes .
And Baasha king of Israel went vp against Iudah , and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to goe out or come in to Asa king of Iudah .
Then Asa tooke all the siluer and the golde that were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the kings house , and deliuered them into the hand of his seruants : and king Asa sent them to Benhadad the sonne of Tabrimon , the sonne of Hezion king of Syria , that dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
There is a league betweene me and thee , and betweene my father and thy father : behold , I haue sent vnto thee a present of siluer and gold ; come and breake the league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me .
So Benhadad hearkened vnto king Asa , and sent the captaines of the hosts , which he had , against the cities of Israel , and smote Iion , and Dan , and Abel - Bethmaachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
And it came to passe when Baasha heard thereof , that hee left off building of Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah .
Then king Asa made a Proclamation throughout all Iudah , ( none was exempted : ) and they tooke away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha had builded , and king Asa built with them Geba of Beniamin , and Mizpah .
The rest of all the acts of Asa , and all his might , and all that he did , and the cities which hee built , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah ? Neuerthelesse in the time of his old age , hee was diseased in his feete .
And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers , in the citie of Dauid his father : and Iehoshaphat his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ And Nadab the sonne of Ieroboam began to reigne ouer Israel , in the second yeere of Asa king of Iudah , and reigned ouer Israel two yeeres .
And he did euill in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sinne wherewith hee made Israel to sinne .
¶ And Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him , and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belongeth to the Philistines , ( for Nadab and all Israel layd siege to Gibbethon , )
Euen in the third yeere of Asa king of Iudah , did Baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead .
And it came to passe when hee raigned , that he smote all the house Ieroboam , hee left not to Ieroboam any that breathed , vntill hee had destroyed him , according vnto the saying of the Lord , which hee spake by his seruant Ahiiah the Shilonite :
Because of the sinnes of Ieroboam which he sinned , and which hee made Israel sinne , by his prouocation wherewith he prouoked the Lord God of Israel to anger .
¶ Now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
And there was warre betweene Asa and Baasha king of Israel al their dayes .
In the third yeere of Asa King of Iudah , began Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah to reigne ouer all Israel in Tirzah , twentie and foure yeeres .
<NON-VERSE>
Then the word of the Lord came to Iehu the sonne of Hanani , against Baasha , saying ,
Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust , and made thee Prince ouer my people Israel , and thou hast walked in the way of Ieroboam , and hast made my people Israel to sinne , to prouoke mee to anger with their sinnes :
Behold , I will take away the posteritie of Baasha , and the posteritie of his house : and will make thy house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat .
Him that dieth of Baasha in the citie , shall the dogs eate : and him that dieth of his in the fields , shall the foules of the aire eate .
Now the rest of the actes of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
So Baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in Tirzah , and Elah his sonne reigned in his stead .
And also by the hand of the prophet Iehu the sonne of Hanani , came the word of the Lord against Baasha , and against his house , euen for all the euill that hee did in the sight of the Lord , in prouoking him to anger with the worke of his hands , in being like the house of Ieroboam , and because he killed him .
¶ In the twentieth and sixt yeere of Asa king of Iudah , began Elah the sonne of Baasha to reigne ouer Israel in Tirzah , two yeeres .
And his seruant Zimri ( captaine of halfe his charets ) conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himselfe drunke in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah .
And Zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twentie and seuenth yeere of Asa king of Iudah , and reigned in his stead .
¶ And it came to passe when hee began to reigne , assoone as hee sate on his throne , that he slew all the house of Baasha : hee left him not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of his kinsfolkes , nor of his friends .
Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake against Baasha by Iehu the prophet ,
For all the sinnes of Baasha and the sinnes of Elah his sonne , by which they sinned , and by which they made Israel to sinne , in prouoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
Now the rest of the actes of Elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
¶ In the twentie and seuenth yeere of Asa king of Iudah , did Zimri reigne seuen dayes in Tirzah : and the people were encamped against Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines .
And the people that were encamped , heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slaine the king : Wherfore all Israel made Omri the captaine of the hoste , king ouer Israel that day , in the campe .
And Omri went vp from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
And it came to passe when Zimri saw that the citie was taken , that hee went into the palace of the kings house , and burnt the kings house ouer him with fire , and died ,
For his sinnes which he sinned in doing euill in the sight of the Lord , in walking in the way of Ieroboam , and in his sinne which he did , to make Israel sinne .
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that hee wrought , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
¶ Then were the people of Israel diuided into two parts : halfe of the people followed Tibni the sonne of Ginath , to make him king : and halfe followed Omri .
But the people that followed Omri preuailed against the people that followed Tibni the sonne of Ginath : so Tibni died , and Omri reigned .
¶ In the thirtie and one yeere of Asa king of Iudah , began Omri to reigne ouer Israel twelue yeeres : sixe yeeres reigned he in Tirzah .
And hee bought the hill Samaria of Shemer , for two talents of siluer , and built on the hill , and called the name of the citie which hee built , after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill , Samaria .
¶ But Omri wrought euil in the eyes of the Lord , and did worse then all that were before him .
For he walked in all the way of Ieroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sinne wherewith hee made Israel to sinne , to prouoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
Now the rest of the acts of Omri , which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
So Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria , and Ahab his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ And in the thirtie and eight yeere of Asa king of Iudah , began Ahab the sonne of Omri to reigne ouer Israel , and Ahab the sonne of Omri reigned ouer Israel in Samaria , twentie and two yeeres .
And Ahab the sonne of Omri did euill in the sight of the Lord , aboue all that were before him .
And it came to passe , as if it had beene a light thing for him to walke in the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat ; that hee tooke to wife Iezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians , and went and serued Baal , and worshipped him .
And hee reared vp an Altar for Baal , in the house of Baal , which hee had built in Samaria .
And Ahab made a groue , and Ahab did more to prouoke the Lord God of Israel to anger , then all the kings of Israel that were before him .
<NON-VERSE>
And Eliiah the Tishbite , who was of the inhabitants of Gilead , said vnto Ahab , As the Lord God of Israel liueth , before whome I stand , there shall not be deaw nor raine these yeres , but according to my word .
And the worde of the Lord came vnto him , saying ,
Get thee hence , and turne thee Eastward , and hide thy selfe by the brooke Cherith , that is before Iordane .
And it shall bee , that thou shalt drinke of the brooke , and I haue commanded the rauens to feed thee there .
So hee went , and did according vnto the word of the Lord : for hee went and dwelt by the brooke Cherith , that is before Iordane .
And the rauens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the euening : and hee dranke of the brooke .
And it came to passe after a while , that the brooke dryed vp , because there had beene no raine in the land .
¶ And the word of the Lord came vnto him , saying ,
Arise , get thee to Zarephath , which belongeth to Zidon , and dwell there : behold , I haue commaunded a widow woman there to sustaine thee .
So he arose , and went to Zarephath : and when he came to the gate of the citie , behold , the widow woman was there gathering of stickes : and he called to her , and said , Fetch me , I pray thee , a little water in a vessell , that I may drinke .
And as shee was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring mee , I pray thee , a morsell of bread in thine hand .
And she said , As the Lord thy God liueth , I haue not a cake , but an handfull of meale in a barrell , and a little oyle in a cruse : and behold , I am gathering two stickes , that I may goe in , and dresse it for me and my sonne , that we may eate it , and die .
And Eliiah said vnto her , Feare not , goe , and doe as thou hast said : but make mee thereof a little cake first , and bring it vnto mee , and after make for thee , and for thy sonne .
For thus saith the Lord God of Israel , The barrell of meale shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oile faile , vntill the day that the Lord sendeth raine vpon the earth .
And shee went , and did according to the saying of Eliiah : and she , and he , and her house did eate many dayes .
And the barrell of meale wasted not , neither did the cruse of oyle faile , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Eliiah .
¶ And it came to passe after these things , that the sonne of the woman , the mistresse of the house , fell sicke , and his sickenesse was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
And shee sayd vnto Eliiah , What haue I to doe with thee ? O thou man of God ! Art thou come vnto me to call my sinne to remembrance , and to slay my sonne ?
And he said vnto her , Giue me thy sonne . And he tooke him out of her bosome , and caried him vp into a loft , where he abode , and laide him vpon his owne bed .
And hee cried vnto the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , hast thou also brought euill vpon the widow , with whom I soiourne , by slaying her sonne ?
And he stretched himselfe vpon the child three times , and cried vnto the Lord , and said ; O Lord my God , I pray thee , let this childes soule come into him againe .
And the Lord heard the voice of Eliiah , and the soule of the child came into him againe , and he reuiued .
And Eliiah tooke the childe , and brought him downe out of the chamber into the house , and deliuered him vnto his mother : and Eliiah said , See , thy sonne liueth .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe after many daies , that the word of the Lord came to Eliiah in the third yeere , saying , Goe shewe thy selfe vnto Ahab , and I will send raine vpon the earth .
And Eliiah went to shew himselfe vnto Ahab , and there was a sore famine in Samaria .
And Ahab called Obadiah which was the gouernour of his house : ( now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly :
For it was so , when Iezebel cut off the Prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah tooke an hundred Prophets , and hid them by fiftie in a caue , and fed them with bread and water . )
And Ahab said vnto Obadiah , Goe into the land , vnto all fountaines of water , and vnto all brookes : peraduenture we may finde grasse to saue the horses and mules aliue , that we leese not all the beasts .
So they diuided the land betweene them to passe throughout it : Ahab went one way by himselfe , and Obadiah went another way by himselfe .
¶ And as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Eliiah met him : and hee knew him , and fell on his face , and said ; Art thou that my lord Eliiah ?
And he answered him , I am : goe , tell thy lord , Behold , Eliiah is here .
And he said , What haue I sinned , that thou wouldest deliuer thy seruant into the hand of Ahab , to slay mee ?
As the Lord thy God liueth , there is no nation or kingdome , whither my lord hath not sent to seeke thee : and when they said , He is not there , hee tooke an oath of the kingdome and nation , that they found thee not .
And now thou sayest , Goe , tell thy lord , Behold , Eliiah is here .
And it shall come to passe , as soone as I am gone from thee , that the spirit of the Lord shall cary thee whither I know not ; and so when I come and tell Ahab , and he cannot finde thee , he shall slay mee : but I thy seruant feare the Lord from my youth .
Was it not told my lord , what I did when Iezebel slew the Prophets of the Lord ? How I hid an hundred men of the Lords Prophets , by fiftie in a caue , and fedde them with bread and water ?
And now thou sayest , Goe , tell thy lord , Behold , Eliiah is here : and hee shall slay me .
And Eliiah said , As the Lord of hostes liueth , before whom I stand , I will surely shew my selfe vnto him to day .
So Obadiah went to meete Ahab , and told him : and Ahab went to meete Eliiah .
¶ And it came to passe when Ahab saw Eliiah , that Ahab saide vnto him , Art thou hee that troubleth Israel ?
And hee answered , I haue not troubled Israel , but thou and thy fathers house , in that yee haue forsaken the Commandements of the Lord , and thou hast followed Baalim .
Now therefore send , and gather to mee all Israel vnto mount Carmel , and the prophets of Baal foure hundred and fiftie , and the prophets of the groues foure hundred , which eate at Iezebels table .
So Ahab sent vnto all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together vnto mount Carmel .
And Eliiah came vnto all the people , and said , how long halt yee betweene two opinions ? If the Lord bee God , follow him : but if Baal , then follow him : and the people answered him not a word .
Then said Eliiah vnto the people , I , euen I onely remaine a Prophet of the Lord : but Baals prophets are foure hundred and fiftie men .
Let them therefore giue vs two bullocks , and let them chuse one bullocke for themselues , and cut it in pieces , and lay it on wood , and put no fire vnder : and I will dresse the other bullocke , and lay it on wood , and put no fire vnder .
And call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the Name of the Lord : and the God that answereth by fire , let him be God . And all the people answered , and said , It is well spoken .
And Eliiah said vnto the prophets of Baal , Chuse you one bullocke for your selues , and dresse it first , for yee are many : and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire vnder .
And they took the bullocke which was giuen them , and they dressed it , and called on the name of Baal from morning , euen vntil noone , saying , O Baal , heare vs . But there was no voyce , nor any that answered : And they leapt vpon the altar which was made .
And it came to passe at noone , that Eliiah mocked them , and saide , Crie aloud : for he is a god , either he is talking , or he is pursuing , or hee is in a iourney , or peraduenture he sleepeth , and must be awaked .
And they cried loud , and cut themselues after their maner , with kniues , and lancers , till the blood gushed out vpon them .
And it came to passe when midday was past , and they prophesied vntil the time of the offering of the euening sacrifice ; that there was neither voice , nor any to answere , nor any that regarded .
And Eliiah said vnto all the people , Come neere vnto me . And all the people came neere vnto him . And he repaired the Altar of the Lord that was broken downe .
And Eliiah tooke twelue stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sonnes of Iacob , vnto whome the word of the Lord came , saying , Israel shall bee thy name .
And with the stones hee built an altar in the Name of the Lord , and hee made a trench about the altar , as great as would containe two measures of seed . And he put the wood in order , and cut the bullocke in pieces , and laide him on the wood , and said , Fill foure barrels with water , and powre it on the burnt sacrifice , and on the wood .
And hee said , Doe it the second time . And they did it the second time . And he said , Doe it the third time . And they did it the third time .
And the water ran round about the altar , and hee filled the trench also with water .
And it came to passe at the time of the offering of the euening sacrifice , that Eliiah the prophet came neere and said , Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , Let it bee knowen this day that thou art God in Israel , and that I am thy seruant , and that I haue done all these things at thy word .
Heare me , O Lord , heare me , that this people may know that thou art the Lord God , and that thou hast turned their heart backe againe .
Then the fire of the Lord fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked vp the water that was in the trench .
And when all the people sawe it , they fell on their faces : and they saide , The Lord , he is the God , the Lord , he is the God .
And Eliiah saide vnto them , Take the prophets of Baal , let not one of them escape : And they tooke them , and Eliiah brought them downe to the brooke Kishon , and slewe them there .
¶ And Eliiah said vnto Ahab , Get thee vp , eate and drinke , for there is a sound of abundance of raine .
So Ahab went vp to eate and to drinke , and Eliiah went vp to the top of Carmel , and he cast himselfe downe vpon the earth , and put his face betweene his knees ,
And said to his seruant , Goe vp now , looke toward the Sea . And hee went vp , and looked , and saide , There is nothing . And he said , Goe againe seuen times .
And it came to passe at the seuenth time , that he said , Behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the Sea , like a mans hand . And he said , Goe vp , say vnto Ahab , Prepare thy charet , and get thee downe , that the raine stop thee not .
And it came to passe in the meane while , that the heauen was blacke with cloudes and winde , and there was a great raine : and Ahab rode and went to Iezreel .
<NON-VERSE>
And Ahab told Iezebel all that Eliiah had done , and withall , how hee had slaine all the Prophets with the sword .
Then Iezebel sent a messenger vnto Eliiah , saying ; So let the gods do to me , and more also , if I make not thy life as the life of one of them , by to morrow about this time .
And when he saw that , hee arose , and went for his life , and came to Beersheba , which belongeth to Iudah , and left his seruant there .
¶ But he himselfe went a dayes iourney into the wildernesse , and came and sate downe vnder a Iuniper tree : and hee requested for himselfe that hee might die , and sayd , It is enough , now O Lord , take away my life : for I am not better then my fathers .
And as hee lay and slept vnder a Iuniper tree , behold then , an Angel touched him , and sayd vnto him , Arise , and eate .
And he looked , and behold , there was a cake baken on the coales , and a cruse of water at his head : and hee did eate and drinke , and laide him downe againe .
And the Angel of the Lord came againe the second time , and touched him , and sayd , Arise , and eate , because the iourney is too great for thee .
And hee arose , and did eate and drinke , and went in the strength of that meate fourtie dayes and fourtie nights , vnto Horeb the mount of God .
¶ And he came thither vnto a caue , and lodged there , and behold , the word of the Lord came to him , and he said vnto him , What doest thou here , Eliiah ?
And hee sayd , I haue beene very iealous for the Lord God of hostes : for the children of Israel haue forsaken thy Couenant , throwen downe thine Altars , and slaine thy Prophets with the sword : and I , euen I onely am left , and they seeke my life , to take it away .
And he sayd , Goe forth , and stand vpon the mount before the Lord . And beholde , the Lord passed by , and a great and strong winde rent the mountaines , and brake in pieces the rockes , before the Lord ; but the Lord was not in the winde : and after the winde an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
And after the earthquake , a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire : and after the fire , a still small voice .
And it was so , when Eliiah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entring in of the caue : and behold , there came a voice vnto him , and sayd , What doest thou here , Eliiah ?
And he sayd , I haue beene very iealous for the Lord God of hostes , because the children of Israel haue forsaken thy Couenant , throwen downe thine Altars , and slaine thy Prophets with the sword , and I , euen I onely am left , and they seeke my life , to take it away .
And the Lord sayd vnto him , Goe , returne on thy way to the wildernesse of Damascus : and when thou commest , anoint Hazael to be King ouer Syria .
And Iehu the sonne of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to bee king ouer Israel : and Elisha the sonne of Shaphat of Abel Meholah , shalt thou annoint to be Prophet in thy roume .
And it shall come to passe , that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael , shall Iehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of Iehu , shall Elisha slay .
Yet I haue left me seuen thousand in Israel , all the knees which haue not bowed vnto Baal , and euery mouth which hath not kissed him .
¶ So hee departed thence and found Elisha the sonne of Shaphat , who was plowing with twelue yoke of oxen before him , and hee with the twelfth : and Eliiah passed by him , and cast his mantle vpon him .
And he left the oxen , and ranne after Eliiah , and said , Let mee , I pray thee , kisse my father and my mother , and then I wil follow thee : and he said vnto him , Goe backe againe ; for what haue I done to thee ?
<NON-VERSE>
And Benhadad the King of Syria gathered all his hoste together , and there were thirtie and two kings with him , and horses , and charets : and hee went vp and besieged Samaria , and warred against it .
And hee sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel , into the city , and saide vnto him , Thus saith Benhadad ,
Thy siluer and thy gold is mine , thy wiues also , and thy children , euen the goodliest , are mine .
And the king of Israel answered , and said , My lord O king , according to thy saying , I am thine , and all that I haue .
And the messengers came againe , and saide , Thus speaketh Benhadad , saying , Although I haue sent vnto thee , saying , Thou shalt deliuer me thy siluer , and thy gold , and thy wiues , and thy children :
Yet I will send my seruants vnto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of thy seruants ; and it shall be , that whatsoeuer is pleasant in thine eies , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
Then the king of Israel called all the Elders of the land , and saide ; Marke , I pray you , and see how this man seeketh mischiefe : for hee sent vnto me for my wiues , and for my children , and for my siluer , and for my gold , and I denied him not .
And all the Elders , and all the people said vnto him ; Hearken not vnto him , nor consent .
Wherefore hee said vnto the messengers of Benhadad , Tell my lord the king , All that thou diddest send for to thy seruant at the first , I will doe : but this thing I may not doe . And the messengers departed , and brought him word againe .
And Benhadad sent vnto him , and said , The gods doe so vnto me and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me .
And the king of Israel answered , and said , Tell him , Let not him that girdeth on his harnesse , boast himselfe , as he that putteth it off .
And it came to passe , when Benhadad heard this message ( as hee was drinking , he and the kings in the pauilions ) that hee said vnto his seruants , Set yourselues in aray . And they set themselues in aray against the citie .
¶ And behold , there came a Prophet vnto Ahab king of Israel , saying , Thus saith the Lord , Hast thou seene all this great multitude ? behold , I will deliuer it into thine hand this day , and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord .
And Ahab saide , By whom ? and he saide , Thus saith the Lord , Euen by the young men of the Princes of the prouinces : Then he said , Who shall order the battell ? And hee answered , Thou .
Then he numbred the young men of the Princes of the prouinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two : and after them hee numbred all the people , euen all the children of Israel , being seuen thousand .
And they went out at noone : But Benhadad was drinking himselfe drunke in the pauilions , hee and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him . And the young men of the Princes of the Prouinces went out first , and Benhadad sent out , and they told him , saying , There are men come out of Samaria .
And he said , Whether they be come out for peace , take them aliue : or whether they be come out for warre , take them aliue .
So these yong men of the princes of the prouinces , came out of the citie , and the armie which followed them :
And they slew euery one his man : and the Syrians fled , and Israel pursued them : and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse , with the horsemen .
And the king of Israel went out , and smote the horses and charets , and slewe the Syrians with a great slaughter .
¶ And the Prophet came to the king of Israel , and said vnto him , Goe , strengthen thy selfe , and marke and see what thou doest : for at the returne of the yeere , the king of Syria will come vp against thee .
And the seruants of the King of Syria said vnto him , Their gods are gods of the hilles , therefore they were stronger then wee : but let vs fight against them in the plaine , and surely we shall be stronger then they .
And doe this thing , Take the kings away , euery man out of his place , and put captaines in their roumes .
And number thee an armie , like the armie that thou hast lost , horse for horse , and charet for charet : and wee will fight against them in the plaine , and surely wee shall be stronger then they . And hee hearkened vnto their voice , and did so .
And it came to passe at the returne of the yeere , that Benhadad numbred the Syrians , and went vp to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
And the children of Israel were numbred , and were all present , and went against them : and the children of Israel pitched before them , like two little flockes of kids : but the Syrians filled the countrey .
¶ And there came a man of God , and spake vnto the king of Israel , and sayd , Thus sayth the Lord , Because the Syrians haue sayde , The Lord is God of the hilles , but hee is not God of the valleys : therefore will I deliuer all this great multitude into thine hand , and yee shall know that I am the Lord .
And they pitched one ouer against the other seuen daies , and so it was , that in the seuenth day the battell was ioyned : and the children of Israel slewe of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day .
But the rest fled to Aphek , into the citie , and there a wall fell vpon twentie and seuen thousand of the men that were left : and Benhadad fled , and came into the citie , into an inner chamber .
¶ And his seruants said vnto him , Behold now , wee haue heard that the kings of the house of Israel are mercifull kings : let vs , I pray thee , put sackcloth on our loines , and ropes vpon our heads , and goe out to the king of Israel ; peraduenture he will saue thy life .
So they girded sackcloth on their loynes , and put ropes on their heads , and came to the king of Israel , and said , Thy seruant Benhadad saith , I pray thee , let me liue . And he said , Is he yet aliue ? he is my brother .
Now the men did diligently obserue whether any thing would come from him , and did hastily catch it : and they saide , Thy brother Benhadad . Then he said , Goe ye , bring him : then Benhadad came forth to him : and hee caused him to come vp into the charet .
And Benhadad said vnto him , The cities which my father tooke from thy father , I will restore , and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus , as my father made in Samaria . Then , said Ahab , I will send thee away with this couenant . So he made a couenant with him , and sent him away .
¶ And a certaine man of the sonnes of the Prophets , saide vnto his neighbour in the word of the Lord , Smite me , I pray thee . And the man refused to smite him .
Then said he vnto him , Because thou hast not obeyed the voyce of the Lord , beholde , assoone as thou art departed from me , a lyon shal slay thee . And assoone as hee was departed from him , a lyon found him , and slew him .
Then he found another man , and said , Smite me , I pray thee . And the man smote him , so that in smiting hee wounded him .
So the prophet departed , and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himselfe with ashes vpon his face .
And as the king passed by , he cried vnto the king : and he saide , Thy seruant went out into the mids of the battell , and behold , a man turned aside , and brought a man vnto me , and said , Keep this man : if by any meanes he be missing , then shall thy life be for his life , or else thou shalt pay a talent of siluer .
And as thy seruant was busie here and there , he was gone . And the king of Israel saide vnto him , So shall thy iudgement bee , thy selfe hast discided it .
And he hasted , and tooke the ashes away from his face , and the king of Israel discerned him that hee was of the Prophets .
And hee said vnto him , Thus saith the Lord , Because thou hast let goe out of thy hand , a man whom I appointed to vtter destruction , therfore thy life shall goe for his life , and thy people for his people .

And it came to passe after these things , that Naboth the Iezreelite had a vineyard , which was in Iezreel , hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria .
And Ahab spake vnto Naboth , saying , Giue me thy vineyard , that I may haue it for a garden of herbes , because it is neere vnto my house , and I will giue thee for it a better vineyard then it : or if it seeme good to thee , I will giue thee the worth of it in money .
And Naboth said to Ahab , The Lord forbid it mee , that I should giue the inheritance of my fathers vnto thee .
And Ahab came into his house , heauie , and displeased , because of the word which Naboth the Iezreelite had spoken to him : for he had saide , I will not giue thee the inheritance of my fathers : and he laid him downe vpon his bed , and turned away his face , and would eate no bread .
¶ But Iezebel his wife came to him , and said vnto him , Why is thy spirit so sad , that thou eatest no bread ?
And he said vnto her , Because I spake vnto Naboth the Iezreelite , and said vnto him , Giue mee thy vineyard for money , or else if it please thee , I will giue thee another vineyard for it : And he answered , I wil not giue thee my vineyard .
And Iezebel his wife saide vnto him , Doest thou now gouerne the kingdome of Israel ? Arise , and eate bread , and let thine heart bee merrie : I will giue thee the vineyard of Naboth the Iezreelite .
So shee wrote letters in Ahabs name , and sealed them with his seale , and sent the letters vnto the Elders , and to the Nobles that were in his citie dwelling with Naboth .
And she wrote in the letters , saying , Proclaime a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people :
And set two men , sonnes of Belial before him , to beare witnes against him , saying , Thou diddest blaspheme God and the king : and then carie him out , and stone him that he may die .
And the men of his citie , euen the Elders and the Nobles who were the inhabitants in his citie , did as Iezebel had sent vnto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent vnto them . They proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
And there came in two men , children of Belial , and sate before him : and the men of Belial witnessed against him , euen against Naboth , in the presence of the people , saying , Naboth did blaspheme God and the king . Then they caried him foorth out of the citie , and stoned him with stones , that hee died .
Then they sent to Iezebel , saying , Naboth is stoned , and is dead .
¶ And it came to passe when Iezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead , that Iezebel said to Ahab , Arise , take possession of the Uineyard of Naboth the Iezreelite , which hee refused to giue thee for money : for Naboth is not aliue , but dead .
And it came to passe when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose vp to goe downe to the Uineyard of Naboth the Iezreelite , to take possession of it .
¶ And the word of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite , saying ,
Arise , goe downe to meet Ahab king of Israel , which is in Samaria : behold , hee is in the Uineyard of Naboth , whither he is gone downe to possesse it .
And thou shalt speake vnto him , saying , Thus saith the Lord , Hast thou killed , and also taken possession ? And thou shalt speake vnto him , saying , Thus saith the Lord ; In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth , shall dogges licke thy blood , euen thine .
And Ahab said to Eliiah , Hast thou found me , O mine enemie ? And he answered , I haue found thee : because thou hast sold thy selfe to worke euill in the sight of the Lord .
Behold , I will bring euill vpon thee , and will take away thy posteritie , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut vp , and left in Israel ,
And will make thine house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah , for the prouocation wherewith thou hast prouoked mee to anger , and made Israel to sinne .
And of Iezebel also spake the Lord , saying , The dogs shall eate Iezebel by the wall of Iezreel .
Him that dieth of Ahab in the citie , the dogs shall eate : and him that dieth in the field , shall the foules of the aire eat .
¶ But there was none like vnto Ahab , which did sell himselfe to worke wickednesse in the sight of the Lord , whom Iezebel his wife stirred vp .
And hee did very abominably in following Idoles , according to all things as did the Amorites , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
And it came to passe when Ahab heard those wordes , that hee rent his clothes , and put sackecloth vpon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
And the word of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite , saying ,

And they continued three yeeres without warre betweene Syria and Israel .
And it came to passe on the third yere , that Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah came downe to the king of Israel .
( And the king of Israel said vnto his seruants , Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours , and wee be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ? )
And hee said vnto Iehoshaphat , Wilt thou goe with me to battel to Ramoth Gilead ? And Iehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , I am as thou art , my people as thy people , my horses as thy horses .
And Iehoshaphat said vnto the king of Israel , Enquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord to day .
Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about foure hundred men , and said vnto them , Shall I goe against Ramoth Gilead to battell , or shall I forbeare ? And they said , Goe vp , for the Lord shall deliuer it into the hand of the king .
And Iehoshaphat said , Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord besides , that we might enquire of him ?
And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat , There is yet one man , ( Micaiah the sonne of Imlah ) by whom we may enquire of the Lord ; but I hate him , for he doth not prophesie good concerning me , but euill . And Iehoshaphat said , Let not the King say so .
Then the king of Israel called an Officer , and said , Hasten hither Micaiah the sonne of Imlah .
And the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah sate each on his throne , hauing put on their robes , in a voyd place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria , and all the Prophets prophecied before them .
And Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah made him hornes of yron : and he sayd , Thus saith the Lord , With these shalt thou push the Syrians , vntill thou haue consumed them .
And all the Prophets prophecied so , saying ; Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead , and prosper : for the Lord shall deliuer it into the kings hand .
And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah , spake vnto him , saying , Behold now , the words of the prophets declare good vnto the King with one mouth : let thy word , I pray thee , bee like the word of one of them , and speake that which is good .
And Micaiah sayde , As the Lord liueth , what the Lord saith vnto me , that will I speake .
¶ So he came to the king , and the king sayd vnto him , Micaiah , shall wee goe against Ramoth Gilead to battell , or shall we forbeare ? And he answered him , Go , and prosper : for the Lord shall deliuer it into the hand of the king .
And the king said vnto him , How many times shall I adiure thee , that thou tell me nothing but that which is true , in the Name of the Lord ?
And hee sayd , I saw all Israel scattered vpon the hilles , as sheepe that haue not a shepheard . And the Lord said , These haue no master , let them returne euery man to his house in peace .
And the King of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat , Did I not tell thee , that he would prophecie no good concerning me , but euill ?
And he said , Heare thou therefore the word of the Lord : I sawe the Lord sitting on his Throne , and all the hoste of heauen standing by him , on his right hand and on his left .
And the Lord said , Who shall perswade Ahab , that hee may goe vp and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? And one sayd on this manner , and another said on that manner . And there came forth a spirit , and stood before the Lord , and said , I will perswade him .
And the Lord said vnto him , Wherewith ? And hee sayd , I will goe foorth , and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . And he said , Thou shalt perswade him , and preuaile also : Goe forth , and doe so .
Now therfore behold , the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the Lord hath spoken euill concerning thee .
But Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah went neere , and smote Micaiah on the cheeke , and said , Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me , to speake vnto thee ?
And Micaiah sayde , Beholde , thou shalt see in that day , when thou shalt goe into an inner chamber , to hide thy selfe .
And the King of Israel sayde , Take Micaiah , and cary him backe vnto Amon the gouernour of the citie , and to Ioash the kings sonne :
And say , Thus sayth the King , Put this fellow in the prison , and feede him with bread of affliction , and with water of affliction vntil I come in peace .
And Micaiah saide , If thou returne at all in peace , the Lord hath not spoken by me . And he said , Hearken , O people , euery one of you .
So the King of Israel , and Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah , went vp to Ramoth Gilead .
And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat , I wil disguise my selfe , & enter into the battell , but put thou on thy robes . And the King of Israel disguised himselfe , & went into the battell .
But the King of Syria commanded his thirtie and two Captaines that had rule ouer his charets , saying , Fight neither with small nor great , saue only with the king of Israel .
And it came to passe , when the captaines of the charets saw Iehoshaphat , that they said , Surely it is the king of Israel . And they turned aside to fight against him : and Iehoshaphat cryed out .
And it came to passe , when the captaines of the charets perceiued that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned backe from pursuing him .
And a certaine man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel betweene the ioynts of the harnesse : wherefore hee sayd vnto the driuer of his charet , Turne thine hand , and cary me out of the hoste , for I am wounded . And the battell increased that day : and the king was stayed vp in his charet against the Syrians , and died at euen : and the blood ranne out of the wound , into the mids of the charet .
And there went a proclamation throughout the hoste , about the going downe of the Sunne , saying , Euery man to his citie , and euery man to his owne countrey .
¶ So the King died , and was brought to Samaria , and they buried the king in Samaria .
And one washed the charet in the poole of Samaria , and the dogges licked vp his blood , and they washed his armour , according vnto the word of the Lord which he spake .
Now the rest of the actes of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Iuory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
So Ahab slept with his fathers , and Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ And Iehoshaphat the sonne of Asa began to reigne ouer Iudah in the fourth yeere of Ahab King of Israel .
Iehoshaphat was thirtie and fiue yeeres olde when hee began to reigne , and he reigned twentie and fiue yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
And he walked in all the wayes of Asa his father , hee turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : neuerthelesse , the high places were not taken away : for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places .
And Iehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel .
Now the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat , and his might that hee shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah ?
And the remnant of the Sodomites which remained in the dayes of his father Asa , he tooke out of the land .
There was then no king in Edom : a deputie was king .
Iehoshaphat made shippes of Tharshish to goe to Ophir for golde : but they went not , for the shippes were broken at Ezion Geber .
Then said Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab vnto Iehoshaphat , Let my seruants goe with thy seruants in the ships : But Iehoshaphat would not .
¶ And Iehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid his father : and Iehoram his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria the seuenteenth yeere of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah , and reigned two yeres ouer Israel .
And he did euill in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne .

Peter an Apostle of Iesus Christ , to the strangers scattred thorowout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
Elect , according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit vnto obedience , and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ : Grace vnto you and peace be multiplied .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy , hath begotten vs againe vnto a liuely hope , by the resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead , To an inheritance incorruptible , and vndefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserued in heauen for you ,
Who are kept by the power of God through faith vnto saluation , ready to be reuealed in the last time .
Wherin ye greatly reioyce , though now for a season ( if neede bee ) yee are in heauinesse through manifolde temptations :
That the triall of your faith , being much more precious then of golde that perisheth , though it bee tryed with fire , might be found vnto praise , and honor , and glory , at the appearing of Iesus Christ :
Whom hauing not seene , yee loue , in whom though now ye see him not , yet beleeuing , ye reioyce with ioy vnspeakeable , and full of glory ,
Receiuing the ende of your faith , euen the saluation of your soules :
Of which saluation the Prophets haue inquired , and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come vnto you ,
Searching what , or what maner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signifie , when it testified beforehand the suffrings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
Unto whome it was reuealed , that not vnto themselues , but vnto vs , they did minister the things which are now reported vnto you , by them that haue preached the Gospel vnto you , with the holy Ghost sent downe from heauen , which things the Angels desire to looke into .
Wherefore gird vp the loynes of your minde , bee sober , and hope to the end , for the grace that is to bee brought vnto you at the reuelation of Iesus Christ :
As obedient children , not fashioning your selues according to the former lusts , in your ignorance :
But as hee which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all maner of conuersation ;
Because it is written , Be ye holy , for I am holy .
And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons iudgeth according to euery mans worke , passe the time of your soiourning here in feare :
For as much as ye know that yee were not redeemed with corruptible things , as siluer and golde , from your vaine conuersation receiued by tradition from your fathers ;
But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a Lambe without blemish and without spot ,
Who verily was foreordeined before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you .
Who by him do beleeue in God that raised him vp from the dead , and gaue him glorie , that your faith and hope might be in God .
Seeing yee haue purified your soules in obeying the truth through the Spirit , vnto vnfained loue of the brethren : see that ye loue one another with a pure heart feruently ,
Being borne againe , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God which liueth and abideth for euer .
For all flesh is as grasse , and all the glory of man as the flowre of grasse : the grasse withereth , and the flowre thereof falleth away .

Wherefore laying aside all malice , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and enuies , and euill speakings ,
As new borne babes desire the sincere milke of the word , that ye may grow thereby ,
If so bee yee haue tasted that the Lord is gracious .
To whom comming as vnto a liuing Stone , disallowed in deed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
Ye also as liuely stones , are built vp a spirituall house , an holy Priesthood to offer vp spirituall sacrifice , acceptable to God by Iesus Christ .
Wherefore it is conteined in the Scripture , Beholde , I lay in Sion a chiefe corner stone , elect , precious , and he that beleeueth on him , shall not be confounded .
Unto you therfore which beleeue hee is precious ; but vnto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner ,
And a Stone of stumbling , and a Rocke of offence , euen to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient , whereunto also they were appointed .
But yee are a chosen generation , a royall Priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people , that yee should shewe forth the praises of him , who hath called you out of darknes into his marueilous light :
Which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obteined mercie , but now haue obteined mercy .
Dearely beloued , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrimes , abstaine from fleshly lusts , which warre against the soule ,
Hauing your conuersation honest among the Gentiles , that whereas they speake against you as euill doers , they may by your good works which they shall behold , glorifie God in the day of visitation .
Submit your selues to euery ordinance of man for the Lordes sake , whether it be to the King , as supreme ,
Or vnto gouernours , as vnto them that are sent by him , for the punishment of euil doers , and for the praise of them that doe well .
For so is the will of God , that with well doing yee may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men .
As free , and not vsing your libertie for a cloake of maliciousnesse , but as the seruants of God .
Honour all men . Loue the brotherhood . Feare God . Honour the King .
Seruants , be subiect to your masters with al feare , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
For this is thanke - worthie , if a man for conscience toward God endure griefe , suffering wrongfully .
For what glory is it , if when yee be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently : but if when yee doe well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
For euen hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for vs , leauing vs an example , that yee should follow his steps .
Who did no sinne , neither was guile found in his mouth .
Who when hee was reuiled , reuiled not againe ; when hee suffered , hee threatned not , but committed himselfe to him that iudgeth righteously .
Who his owne selfe bare our sinnes in his owne body on the tree , that wee being dead to sinnes , should liue vnto righteousnesse , by whose stripes ye were healed .

Likewise , ye wiues , be in subiection to your owne husbands , that if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be wonne by the conuersation of the wiues :
While they beholde your chaste conuersation coupled with feare :
Whose adorning , let it not bee that outward adorning , of plaiting the haire , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparell .
But let it bee the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , euen the ornament of a meeke and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
For after this manner in the olde time , the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselues , beeing in subiection vnto their owne husbands .
Euen as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him Lord , whose daughters ye are as long as ye doe well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
Likewise ye husbands , dwel with them according to knowledge , giuing honour vnto the wife as vnto the weaker vessel , and as being heires together of the grace of life , that your prayers be not hindered .
Finally be ye all of one minde , hauing compassion one of another , loue as brethren , be pitifull , be courteous ,
Let him eschew euil and do good , let him seeke peace and ensue it .
For the eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous , and his eares are open vnto their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against them that doe euill .
And who is hee that will harme you , if ye bee followers of that which is good ?
But and if ye suffer for righteousnes sake , happy are ye , and be not afraid of their terrour , neither be troubled :
But sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts , & be ready alwayes to giue an answere to euery man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you , with meekenesse and feare :
Hauing a good conscience , that whereas they speake euill of you , as of euill doers , they may bee ashamed that falsly accuse your good conuersation in Christ .
For it is better , if the will of God be so , that yee suffer for well doing , then for euill doing .
For Christ also hath once suffered for sinnes , the iust for the vniust , that he might bring vs to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit .
By which also he went and preached vnto the spirits in prison ,
Which sometime were disobedient , when once the long - suffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah , while the Arke was a preparing : wherein few , that is , eight soules were saued by water .

For asmuch then as Christ hath suffered for vs in the flesh , arme your selues likewise with the same minde : for hee that hath suffered in the flesh , hath ceassed from sinne :
That he no longer should liue the rest of his time in the flesh , to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
For the time past of our life may suffice vs to haue wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciuiousnes , lusts , excesse of wine , reuellings , banquetings , and abhominable idolatries .
Wherein they thinke it strange , that you runne not with them to the same excesse of riot , speaking euil of you :
Who shal giue accompt to him that is ready to iudge the quicke & the dead .
For , for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might bee iudged according to men in the flesh , but liue according to God in the spirit .
But the ende of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober and watch vnto prayer .
And aboue all things haue feruent charitie among your selues : for charity shall couer the multitude of sinnes .
Use hospitalitie one to another without grudging .
As euery man hath receiued the gift , euen so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
If any man speake , let him speake as the oracles of God : if any man minister , let him doe it as of the ability which God giueth , that God in all things may bee glorified through Iesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for euer and euer . Amen .
Beloued , thinke it not strange concerning the fiery triall , which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened vnto you .
But reioyce in as much as yee are partakers of Christes sufferings ; that when his glory shalbe reueiled , ye may be glad also with exceeding ioy .
If ye be reproched for the Name of Christ , happie are ye , for the spirit of glory , and of God resteth vpon you : on their part hee is euill spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
But let none of you suffer as a murtherer , or as a theefe , or as an euill doer , or as a busibody in other mens matters .
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed , but let him glorifie God on this behalfe .
For the time is come that iudgement must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at vs , what shall the ende bee of them that obey not the Gospel of God ?
And if the righteous scarcely be saued , where shall the vngodly and the sinner appeare ?

The Elders which are among you I exhort , who am also an Elder , and a witnesse of the sufferings of Christ , and also a partaker of the glory that shall be reuealed .
Feede the flocke of God which is among you , taking the ouersight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly : not for filthy lucre , but of a ready minde :
Neither as being lords ouer Gods heritage : but being ensamples to the flocke .
And when the chiefe shepheard shall appeare , ye shall receiue a crowne of glory that fadeth not away .
Likewise ye yonger , submit your selues vnto the elder : yea , all of you bee subiect one to another , and bee clothed with humilitie : for God resisteth the proud , and giueth grace to the humble .
Humble yourselues therefore vnder the mighty hand of God , that hee may exalt you in due time ,
Casting all your care vpon him , for he careth for you .
Be sober , be vigilant : because your aduersary the deuill , as a roaring Lion walketh about , seeking whom he may deuoure .
Whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
But the God of all grace who hath called vs into his eternall glory by Christ Iesus , after that ye haue suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
The Church that is at Babylon elected , together with you , saluteth you , and so doth Marcus my sonne .

Now there was a certaine man of Ramathaim Zophim , of mount Ephraim , & his name was Elkanah , the sonne of Ieroham , the sonne of Elihu , the sonne of Tohu , the sonne of Zuph , an Ephrathite ;
And he had two wiues , the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
And this man went vp out of his citie yeerely , to worship and to sacrifice vnto the Lord of hostes in Shiloh ; and the two sonnes of Eli , Hophni , and Phinehas , the Priests of the Lord , were there .
¶ And when the time was , that Elkanah offered , he gaue to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sonnes , and her daughters , portions .
But vnto Hannah he gaue a worthy portion : ( for he loued Hannah , but the Lord had shut vp her wombe .
And her aduersary also prouoked her sore , for to make her fret , because the Lord had shut vp her wombe . )
And as he did so yeere by yeere , when she went vp to the house of the Lord , so she prouoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
Then said Elkanah her husband to her , Hannah , why weepest thou ? and why eatest thou not ? and why is thy heart grieued ? Am not I better to thee , then ten sonnes ?
¶ So Hannah rose vp after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunke ; ( now Eli the Priest sate vpon a seat by a poste of the Temple of the Lord . )
And shee was in bitternesse of soule , and prayed vnto the Lord , and wept sore .
And she vowed a vow , and said , O Lord of hostes , if thou wilt indeed looke on the affliction of thine handmayd , and remember me , and not forget thine handmayd , but wilt giue vnto thine handmayd a man childe , then I will giue him vnto the Lord all the dayes of his life , and there shall no rasor come vpon his head .
And it came to passe as she continued praying before the Lord , that Eli marked her mouth .
Now Hannah , shee spake in her heart ; onely her lippes mooued , but her voice was not heard : therefore Eli thought she had beene drunken .
And Eli said vnto her , How long wilt thou be drunken ? put away thy wine from thee .
And Hannah answered , and said , No , my lord , I am a woman of a sorrowfull spirit : I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke , but haue powred out my soule before the Lord .
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and griefe , haue I spoken hitherto .
Then Eli answered , and said , Goe in peace : and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition , that thou hast asked of him .
And she said , Let thine handmaid finde grace in thy sight . So the woman went her way , and did eate , and her countenance was no more sad .
¶ And they rose vp in the morning early , and worshipped before the Lord , and returned , and came to their house to Ramah : and Elkanah knewe Hannah his wife , and the Lord remembred her .
Wherefore it came to passe when the time was come about , after Hannah had conceiued , that shee bare a sonne , and called his name Samuel , saying ; Because I haue asked him of the Lord .
And the man Elkanah , and all his house , went vp to offer vnto the Lord the yeerely sacrifice , and his vowe .
But Hannah went not vp ; for shee said vnto her husband , I will not goe vp vntill the childe be weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appeare before the Lord , and there abide for euer .
And Elkanah her husband said vnto her , Do what seemeth thee good , tary vntill thou haue weaned him , only the Lord establish his word : so the woman abode , and gaue her sonne sucke vntill she weaned him .
¶ And when shee had weaned him , shee tooke him vp with her , with three bullocks , and one Ephah of floure , and a bottle of wine , and brought him vnto the house of the Lord in Shiloh : and the childe was young .
And they slew a bullocke , and brought the childe to Eli .
And she said , Oh my lord , as thy soule liueth , my lord , I am the woman , that stood by thee heere , praying vnto the Lord .
For this childe I prayed , and the Lord hath giuen me my petition , which I asked of him :
<NON-VERSE>
And Hannah prayed , and said , My heart reioyceth in the Lord , mine horne is exalted in the Lord : my mouth is inlarged ouer mine enemies : because I reioyce in thy saluation .
There is none holy as the Lord : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any Rocke like our God .
Talke no more so exceeding proudly , let not arrogancie come out of your mouth : for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
The vowes of the mightie men are broken , and they that stumbled are girt with strength .
They that were full , haue hired out themselues for bread : and they that were hungry , ceased : so that the barren hath borne seuen , and she that hath many children , is waxed feeble .
The Lord killeth and maketh aliue , he bringeth downe to the graue , and bringeth vp .
The Lord maketh poore , and maketh rich : he bringeth low , and lifteth vp .
He raiseth vp the poore out of the dust , and lifteth vp the begger from the dunghill , to set them among princes , and to make them inherit the throne of glory : for the pillars of the earth are the Lords , and hee hath set the world vpon them .
He will keepe the feet of his saints , and the wicked shall bee silent in darkenesse ; for by strength shall no man preuaile .
The aduersaries of the Lord shalbe broken to pieces : out of heauen shal he thunder vpon them : the Lord shall iudge the ends of the earth , and he shal giue strength vnto his king , and exalt the horne of his Anointed .
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house , and the child did minister vnto the Lord before Eli the Priest .
¶ Now the sonnes of Eli were sonnes of Belial , they knewe not the Lord .
And the priests custome with the people was , that when any man offred sacrifice , the priestes seruant came , while the flesh was in seething , with a fleshhooke of three teeth in his hand ,
And he strooke it into the panne , or kettle , or caldron , or pot : all that the flesh - hooke brought vp , the priest tooke for himselfe : so they did in Shiloh vnto all the Israelites that came thither .
Also before they burnt the fat , the priests seruant came , & said to the man that sacrificed , Giue flesh to roste for the priest , for he wil not haue sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
And if any man said vnto him , Let them not faile to burne the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soule desireth : then hee would answere him , Nay , but thou shalt giue it mee now : and if not , I will take it by force .
Wherefore the sinne of the yong men was very great before the Lord : for men abhorred the offering of the Lord .
¶ But Samuel ministred before the Lord , being a child , girded with a linnen Ephod .
Moreouer , his mother made him a litle coate , and brought it to him from yeere to yeere , when she came vp with her husband , to offer the yeerely sacrifice .
¶ And Eli blessed Elkanah , and his wife , and said , The Lord giue thee seed of this woman , for the loane which is lent to the Lord . And they went vnto their owne home .
And the Lord visited Hannah , so that shee conceiued , and bare three sonnes , and two daughters : and the child Samuel grew before the Lord .
¶ Now Eli was very olde , and heard all that his sonnes did vnto all Israel , and how they lay with the women that assembled at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation
And he said vnto them , Why doe ye such things ? for I heare of your euil dealings , by all this people .
Nay my sonnes : for it is no good report that I heare ; yee make the Lords people to transgresse .
If one man sinne against another , the Iudge shall iudge him : but if a man sinne against the Lord , who shall intreat for him ? Notwithstanding they hearkened not vnto the voice of their father , because the Lord would slay them .
( And the child Samuel grew on , and was in fauour , both with the Lord , and also with men . )
¶ And there came a man of God vnto Eli , and saide vnto him , Thus saith the Lord , Did I plainely appeare vnto the house of thy father , when they were in Egypt in Pharaohs house ?
And did I chuse him out of all the tribes of Israel , to be my Priest , to offer vpon mine altar , to burne incense , to weare an Ephod before me ? and did I giue vnto the house of thy father , all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel ?
Wherefore kicke ye at my sacrifice , and at mine offering , which I haue commaunded in my habitation , and honourest thy sonnes aboue mee , to make your selues fat with the chiefest of all the offrings of Israel my people ?
Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith , I sayd indeede that thy house , & the house of thy father should walke before me for euer : but now the Lord saith , Be it farre from mee ; for them that honour me , I will honour , and they that despise me , shall be lightly esteemed .
Behold , the dayes come , that I will cut off thine arme , and the arme of thy fathers house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
And thou shalt see an enemie in my habitation , in all the wealth which God shall giue Israel , and there shall not bee an olde man in thine house for euer .
And the man of thine , whom I shall not cut off from mine Altar , shall be to consume thine eyes , and to grieue thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the floure of their age .
And this shall bee a signe vnto thee , that shall come vpon thy two sonnes , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall die both of them .
And I will raise me vp a faithfull Priest , that shall doe according to that which is in my heart and in my mind , and I will build him a sure house , and hee shall walke before mine Anointed for euer .

And the child Samuel ministred vnto the Lord before Eli : and the word of the Lord was precious in those daies ; there was no open vision .
And it came to passe at that time , when Eli was layd downe in his place , and his eyes beganne to waxe dimme , that he could not see ;
And yer the lampe of God went out in the Temple of the Lord , where the Arke of God was , and Samuel was layd downe to sleepe ; That the Lord called Samuel , and he answered , Here am I .
And he ranne vnto Eli , and sayd , Here am I , for thou calledst me . And he said , I called not ; lie downe againe . And he went and lay downe .
And the Lord called yet againe , Samuel . And Samuel arose , and went to Eli , and said , Here am I , for thou diddest call me . And he answered , I called not , my sonne ; lie downe againe .
Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither was the word of the Lord yet reuealed vnto him .
And the Lord called Samuel againe the third time . And hee arose , and went to Eli , and said , Here am I , for thou diddest call me . And Eli perceiued that the Lord had called the childe .
Therefore Eli said vnto Samuel , Go , lie downe , & it shal be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speake Lord , for thy seruant heareth . So Samuel went , and lay downe in his place .
And the Lord came , and stood and called as at other times , Samuel , Samuel . Then Samuel answered , Speake , for thy seruant heareth .
¶ And the Lord sayd to Samuel , Behold , I will doe a thing in Israel , at which , both the eares of euery one that heareth it , shall tingle .
In that day , I will performe against Eli , all things which I haue spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
For I haue tolde him , that I will iudge his house for euer , for the iniquitie which hee knoweth : because his sonnes made themselues vile , and he restrained them not .
And therefore I haue sworne vnto the house of Eli , that the iniquitie of Elies house shall not be purged with sacrifice , nor offering for euer .
¶ And Samuel lay vntill the morning , and opened the doores of the house of the Lord : and Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision .
Then Eli called Samuel , and said , Samuel my sonne . And he answered , Here am I .
And he said , What is the thing that the Lord hath said vnto thee ? I pray thee hide it not from mee : God doe so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any thing from me , of all the things that hee said vnto thee .
And Samuel tolde him euery whit , and hid nothing from him . And he said , It is the Lord : Let him doe what seemeth him good .
¶ And Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him , and did let none of his words fall to the ground .
And all Israel from Dan euen to Beer - sheba , knew that Samuel was established to bee a Prophet of the Lord .

And the word of Samuel came to all Israel . Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battell , and pitched beside Eben - ezer : and the Philistines pitched in Aphek .
And the Philistines put themselues in aray against Israel : and when they ioyned battell , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the armie in the field , about foure thousand men .
¶ And when the people were come into the campe , the Elders of Israel said , Wherefore hath the Lord smitten vs to day before the Philistines ? Let vs fetch the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord out of Shiloh vnto vs , that when it commeth among vs , it may saue vs out of the hand of our enemies .
So the people sent to Shiloh , that they might bring from thence the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord of hostes , which dwelleth betweene the Cherubims : and the two sonnes of Eli , Hophni , and Phinehas were there , with the Arke of the Couenant of God .
And when the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord came into the campe , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang againe .
And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the campe of the Hebrewes ? And they vnderstood , that the Arke of the Lord was come into the campe .
And the Philistines were afraid , for they saide , God is come into the campe . And they said , Woe vnto vs : for there hath not bene such a thing heretofore .
Woe vnto vs : who shall deliuer vs out of the hand of these mightie Gods ? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wildernesse .
Bee strong , and quit your selues like men , O ye Philistines , that yee be not seruants vnto the Hebrewes , as they haue bene to you : quit your selues like men , and fight .
¶ And the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled euery man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter , for there fell of Israel thirtie thousand footmen .
And the Arke of God was taken , and the two sonnes of Eli , Hophni , and Phinehas were slaine .
¶ And there ran a man of Beniamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent , and with earth vpon his head .
And when hee came , loe , Eli sate vpon a seat by the way side , watching : for his heart trembled for the Arke of God . And when the man came into the citie , and told it , all the city cried out .
And when Eli heard the noise of the crying , hee said ; What meaneth the noise of this tumult ? And the man came in hastily , and told Eli .
Now Eli was ninetie and eight yeeres old , and his eyes were dimme , that he could not see .
And the man said vnto Eli , I am he , that came out of the army , and I fled to day out of the army . And he said , What is there done , my sonne ?
And the messenger answered , and said , Israel is fled before the Philistines , and there hath bene also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sonnes also , Hophni & Phinehas , are dead , and the Arke of God is taken .
And it came to passe when hee made mention of the Arke of God , that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate , and his necke brake , and hee died : for hee was an old man , and heauie , and hee had iudged Israel fortie yeeres .
¶ And his daughter in law Phinehas wife was with childe neere to be deliuered : and when shee heard the tidings that the Arke of God was taken , and that her father in law , and her husband were dead , shee bowed her selfe and traueyled ; for her paines came vpon her .
And about the time of her death , the women that stood by her , said vnto her : Feare not , for thou hast borne a sonne . But she answered not , neither did she regard it .
And she named the childe Ichabod , saying , The glory is departed from Israel , ( because the Arke of God was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband . )
When the Philistines tooke the Arke of God , they brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
¶ And when they of Ashdod arose earely on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen vpon his face to the earth , before the Arke of the Lord : and they tooke Dagon , and set him in his place againe .
And when they arose earely on the morrow morning , behold , Dagon was fallen vpon his face to the ground , before the Arke of the Lord : and the head of Dagon , and both the palmes of his hands were cut off vpon the threshold , only the stumpe of Dagon was left to him .
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any that come into Dagons house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod vnto this day .
But the hand of the Lord was heauy vpon them of Ashdod , and he destroyed them , and smote them with Emerods , euen Ashdod , and the coastes thereof .
And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , The Arke of the God of Israel shall not abide with vs : for his hand is sore vpon vs , and vpon Dagon our god .
They sent therefore , and gathered all the lords of the Philistines vnto them , and said , What shall we doe with the Arke of the God of Israel ? And they answered , Let the Arke of the God of Israel bee caried about vnto Gath . And they caried the Arke of the God of Israel about thither .
And it was so , that after they had caried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the citie with a very great destruction : and hee smote the men of the citie both small and great , and they had Emerods in their secret parts .
¶ Therfore they sent the Arke of God to Ekron : and it came to passe as the Arke of God came to Ekron , that the Ekronites cried out , saying , They haue brought about the Arke of the God of Israel to vs , to slay vs , and our people .
So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines , and said , Send away the Arke of the God of Israel , and let it goe againe to his owne place , that it slay vs not , and our people : for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the citie : The hand of God was very heauy there .

And the Arke of the Lord was in the countrey of the Philistines seuen moneths .
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diuiners , saying , What shall we doe to the Arke of the Lord ? Tell vs wherewith we shall send it to his place ?
And they said , If yee send away the Arke of the God of Israel , send it not empty : but in any wise returne him a trespasse offring : then ye shall be healed , and it shall be knowen to you , why his hand is not remooued from you .
Then said they , What shall be the trespasse offering , which wee shall returne to him ? They answered , Fiue golden Emerods , and fiue golden mice , according to the number of the lordes of the Philistines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
Wherefore ye shall make images of your Emerodes , and images of your Mice , that marre the land , and ye shall giue glory vnto the God of Israel : peraduenture hee will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
Wherefore then doe yee harden your hearts , as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts ? when he had wrought wonderfully among them , did they not let the people goe , and they departed ?
Now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch - kine , on which there hath come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring the calues home from them .
And take the Arke of the Lord , and lay it vpon the cart , and put the iewels of golde , which ye returne him for a trespasse offering , in a coffer by the side thereof , and send it away , that it may goe .
And see , if it goeth vp by the way of his owne coast to Bethshemesh , then he hath done vs this great euill : but if not , then wee shall know that it is not his hand that smote vs ; it was a chance that happened to vs .
¶ And the men did so : and tooke two milch - kine , and tied them to the cart , and shut vp their calues at home .
And they layde the Arke of the Lord vpon the cart , and the coffer , with the mice of golde , and the images of their Emerods .
And the kine tooke the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh , and went along the high way , lowing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand , or to the left : and the lords of the Philistines went after them , vnto the border of Bethshemesh .
And the Leuites tooke downe the Arke of the Lord , and the coffer that was with it , wherein the iewels of golde were , and put them on the great stone : And the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offrings , and sacrificed sacrifices the same day vnto the Lord .
And when the fiue lordes of the Philistines had seene it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
And these are the golden Emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespasse offering vnto the Lord ; for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Askelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one .
And the golden Mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines , belonging to the fiue lordes , both of fenced cities , and of countrey villages , euen vnto the great stone of Abel , whereon they set downe the Arke of the Lord ; which stone remaineth vnto this day , in the field of Ioshua the Bethshemite .
¶ And he smote the men of Bethshemesh , because they had looked into the Arke of the Lord , euen he smote of the people fiftie thousand , and threescore and tenne men : and the people lamented , because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter .
And the men of Bethshemesh said , Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God ? and to whom shal he goe vp from vs ?

And the men of Kiriath - iearim came , and fetcht vp the Arke of the Lord , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his sonne , to keepe the Arke of the Lord .
And it came to passe while the Arke abode in Kiriath - iearim , that the time was long : for it was twentie yeeres : and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord .
¶ And Samuel spake vnto all the house of Israel , saying , If ye doe returne vnto the Lord with all your hearts , then put away the strange gods , and Ashtaroth from among you , and prepare your hearts vnto the Lord , and serue him onely : & he will deliuer you out of the hand of the Philistines .
Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim , and Ashtaroth , and serued the Lord onely .
And Samuel said , Gather all Israel to Mizpeh , and I will pray for you vnto the Lord .
And they gathered together to Mizpeh , and drew water , and powred it out before the Lord , and fasted on that day , and said there , We haue sinned against the Lord . And Samuel iudged the children of Israel in Mizpeh .
And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went vp against Israel : and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
And the children of Israel said to Samuel , Cease not to crie vnto the Lord our God for vs , that he will saue vs out of the hand of the Philistines .
¶ And Samuel tooke a sucking lambe , and offered it for a burnt offering wholly vnto the Lord ; and Samuel cried vnto the Lord for Israel , and the Lord heard him .
And as Samuel was offering vp the burnt offering , the Philistines drewe neere to battell against Israel : but the Lord thundred with a great thunder on that day vpon the Philistines , and discomfited them , and they were smitten before Israel .
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh , and pursued the Philistines , and smote them , vntill they came vnder Bethcar .
Then Samuel tooke a stone , and set it betweene Mizpeh and Shen , and called the name of it Eben - Ezer , saying , Hitherto hath the Lord helped vs .
¶ So the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines , all the dayes of Samuel .
And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel , were restored to Israel , from Ekron euen vnto Gath , and the coasts thereof did Israel deliuer out of the hands of the Philistines : and there was peace betweene Israel and the Amorites .
And Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his life .
And he went from yeere to yeere in circuit to Bethel , and Gilgal , and Mizpeh , and iudged Israel in all those places .

And it came to passe , when Samuel was old , that he made his sonnes Iudges ouer Israel .
Now the name of his first borne was Ioel , and the name of his second , Abiah : they were Iudges in Beer - sheba .
And his sonnes walked not in his wayes , but turned aside after lucre , and tooke bribes , & peruerted iudgement .
Then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselues together , and came to Samuel vnto Ramah ,
And said vnto him , Behold , thou art olde , and thy sonnes walke not in thy wayes : now make vs a King to iudge vs , like all the nations .
¶ But the thing displeased Samuel , when they said , Giue vs a King to iudge vs : and Samuel prayed vnto the Lord .
And the Lord said vnto Samuel , Hearken vnto the voyce of the people in all that they say vnto thee : for they haue not reiected thee , but they haue reiected mee , that I should not reigne ouer them .
According to all the works which they haue done since the day that I brought them vp out of Egypt euen vnto this day , wherewith they haue forsaken me , and serued other gods : so doe they also vnto thee .
Nowe therefore hearken vnto their voyce : howbeit , yet protest solemnly vnto them , and shew them the maner of the King that shall reigne ouer them .
¶ And Samuel told all the words of the Lord vnto the people , that asked of him a King .
And hee sayd , This will be the maner of the king that shall reigne ouer you : Hee will take your sonnes , and appoint them for himselfe for his charets , and to bee his horsemen , and some shall runne before his charets .
And hee will appoint him Captaines ouer thousands , and captaines ouer fifties , and will set them to eare his ground , and to reape his haruest , and to make his instruments of warre , and instruments of his charets .
And he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and giue to his officers , and to his seruants .
And hee will take your men seruants , and your mayd seruants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his worke .
Hee will take the tenth of your sheepe , and ye shall be his seruants .
And ye shall cry out in that day , because of your king which ye shall haue chosen you ; and the Lord will not heare you in that day .
¶ Neuerthelesse , the people refused to obey the voyce of Samuel ; and they said , Nay , but we will haue a King ouer vs :
That we also may be like all the nations , and that our King may iudge vs , and goe out before vs , and fight our battels .
And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the eares of the Lord .
And he had a sonne , whose name was Saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person then hee : from his shoulders and vpward , hee was higher then any of the people .
And the asses of Kish , Sauls father , were lost ; and Kish said to Saul his sonne , Take nowe one of the seruants with thee , and arise , goe seeke the asses .
And he passed thorow mount Ephraim , and passed thorow the land of Shalisha , but they found them not : then they passed thorow the land of Shalim , and there they were not : and hee passed thorow the land of the Beniamites , but they found them not .
And when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his seruant that was with him , Come , and let vs returne , lest my father leaue caring for the asses , and take thought for vs .
And hee said vnto him , Behold now , there is in this citie a man of God , and he is an honourable man ; all that he saith , commeth surely to passe : Now let vs goe thither ; peraduenture he can shew vs our way that we should goe .
Then said Saul to his seruaunt , But behold , if we goe , what shall wee bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God : What haue wee ?
And the seruant answered Saul againe , and said , Behold , I haue here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of siluer ; that wil I giue to the man of God , to tell vs our way .
( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to enquire of God , thus he spake ; Come , and let vs go to the Seer : for he that is now called a Prophet , was beforetime called a Seer . )
Then said Saul to his seruant , Wel said , come , let vs go : so they went vnto the city where the man of God was .
Assoone as ye be come into the citie , ye shall straightway finde him , before he goe vp to the high place to eate : for the people will not eate vntill hee come , because he doth blesse the sacrifice , and afterwards they eat that be bidden : Now therefore get you vp , for about this time ye shall finde him .
And they went vp into the citie : and when they were come into the citie , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to goe vp to the hie place .
¶ Now the Lord had told Samuel in his eare a day before Saul came , saying ,
To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Beniamin , and thou shalt anoynt him to be Captaine ouer my people Israel , that he may saue my people out of the hand of the Philistines : for I haue looked vpon my people , because their cry is come vnto me .
And when Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said vnto him , Behold the man whom I spake to thee of : this same shall reigne ouer my people .
Then Saul drew neere to Samuel in the gate , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , where the Seers house is .
And Samuel answered Saul , and said , I am the Seer : Goe vp before me vnto the high place , for ye shall eate with me to day , and to morrow I will let thee goe , and will tell thee all that is in thine heart .
And as for thine asses that were lost three dayes agoe , set not thy minde on them , for they are found : And on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , & on all thy fathers house ?
And Saul answered , and said , Am not I a Beniamite , of the smallest of the tribes of Israel ? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Beniamin ? Wherefore then speakest thou so to me ?
And Samuel tooke Saul , and his seruant , and brought them into the parlour , & made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirtie persons .
And Samuel said vnto the cooke , Bring the portion which I gaue thee , of which I said vnto thee , Set it by thee .
And the cooke took vp the shoulder , and that which was vpon it , and set it before Saul , and Samuel said , Behold , that which is left , set it before thee , and eate : for vnto this time hath it bene kept for thee , since I said I haue inuited the people : So Saul did eat with Samuel that day .
¶ And when they were come downe from the high place into the citie , Samuel communed with Saul vpon the top of the house .
And they arose early : and it came to passe about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away : And Saul arose , and they went out both of them , hee and Samuel , abroad .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Samuel tooke a viall of oile , and powred it vpon his head , & kissed him , and said , Is it not because the Lord hath anoynted thee to be captain ouer his inheritance ?
When thou art departed from me to day , then thou shalt find two men by Rachels sepulchre in the border of Beniamin , at Zelzah : and they will say vnto thee , The asses which thou wentest to seeke , are found : and loe , thy father hath left the care of the asses , and sorroweth for you , saying , What shall I doe for my sonne ?
Then shalt thou goe on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plaine of Tabor , and there shall meete thee three men , going vp to God to Bethel , one carying three kids , and another carying three loaues of bread , and another carying a bottle of wine .
And they will salute thee , and giue thee two loaues of bread , which thou shalt receiue of their hands .
After that thou shalt come to the hill of God , where is the garison of the Philistines : and it shall come to passe when thou art come thither to the citie , that thou shalt meet a company of prophets comming downe from the high place , with a psalterie , and a tabret , and a pipe , and a harpe before them , and they shall prophecie .
And the Spirit of the Lord will come vpon thee , and thou shalt prophecie with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
And let it be when these signes are come vnto thee , that thou doe as occasion serue thee , for God is with thee .
And thou shalt goe downe before me to Gilgal , and behold , I will come downe vnto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seuen dayes shalt thou tarie , till I come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt doe .
¶ And it was so that when he had turned his backe to go from Samuel , God gaue him another heart : and all those signes came to passe that day .
And when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of the prophets met him , and the spirit of God came vpon him , and hee prophesied among them .
And it came to passe when all that knew him beforetime , saw , that behold , hee prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come vnto the sonne of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ?
And one of the same place answered , and sayd , But who is their father ? Therefore it became a prouerbe , Is Saul also among the Prophets ?
And when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
¶ And Sauls vncle saide vnto him , and to his seruant , Whither went ye ? And he said , To seeke the asses : and when we saw that they were no where , we came to Samuel .
And Sauls vncle said , Tell me , I pray thee , what Samuel said vnto you .
And Saul sayd vnto his vncle ; He told vs plainely that the asses were found . But of the matter of the kingdome , whereof Samuel spake , he told him not .
¶ And Samuel called the people together vnto the Lord to Mizpeh ;
And said vnto the children of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I brought vp Israel out of Egypt , and deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all kingdomes , and of them that oppressed you .
And ye haue this day reiected your God , who himselfe saued you out of all your aduersities & your tribulations : and ye haue said vnto him , Nay , but set a king ouer vs . Now therefore present your selues before the Lord by your tribes , and by your thousands .
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come neere , the tribe of Beniamin was taken .
When he had caused the tribe of Beniamin to come neere by their families , the familie of Matri was taken , and Saul the sonne of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
Therefore they enquired of the Lord further , if the man should yet come thither : and the Lord answered , Behold , hee hath hid himselfe among the stuffe .
And they ranne , and fetched him thence , and when he stood among the people , he was higher then any of the people , from the shoulders & vpward .
And Samuel said to all the people , See ye him whome the Lord hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? And all the people shouted , and saide , God saue the King .
Then Samuel tolde the people the maner of the kingdome , and wrote it in a booke , and layd it vp before the Lord , and Samuel sent all the people away , euery man to his house .
¶ And Saul also went home to Gibeah , and there went with him a band of men , whose hearts God had touched .
And Nahash the Ammonite answered them , On this condition will I make a couenant with you , that I may thrust out all your right eyes , and lay it for a reproch vpon all Israel .
And the Elders of Iabesh sayd vnto him , Giue vs seuen daies respite , that we may send messengers vnto all the coasts of Israel : and then , if there be no man to saue vs , we will come out to thee .
¶ Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul , and told the tidings in the eares of the people : and all the people lift vp their voyces , and wept .
And behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field , and Saul sayd , What aileth the people that they weep ? and they told him the tidings of the men of Iabesh .
And the Spirit of God came vpon Saul , when he heard those tydings , and his anger was kindled greatly .
And he tooke a yoke of oxen , and hewed them in pieces , and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers , saying , Whosoeuer commeth not foorth after Saul and after Samuel , so shall it bee done vnto his oxen : and the feare of the Lord fell on the people , and they came out with one consent .
And when he numbred them in Bezek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Iudah thirty thousand .
And they said vnto the messengers that came , Thus shall yee say vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead , To morrow by that time the sunne be hote , ye shal haue helpe . And the messengers came , and shewed it to the men of Iabesh , and they were glad .
Therfore the men of Iabesh said , To morrow wee will come out vnto you , and ye shall doe with vs all that seemeth good vnto you .
And it was so on the morrow , that Saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch , and slewe the Ammonites , vntill the heat of the day : and it came to passe , that they which remained were scattered , so that two of them were not left together .
¶ And the people said vnto Samuel , Who is he that said , Shall Saul reigne ouer vs ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
And Saul said , There shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the Lord hath wrought saluation in Israel .
Then said Samuel to the people , Come , and let vs goe to Gilgal , and renew the kingdome there .
<NON-VERSE>
And Samuel saide vnto all Israel , Beholde , I haue hearkned vnto your voice in all that ye said vnto mee , and haue made a King ouer you .
And now behold , the King walketh before you : and I am olde , and gray headed , and behold , my sonnes are with you : and I haue walked before you from my childhood vnto this day .
Behold , here I am , witnesse against me before the Lord , and before his Anoynted : Whose oxe haue I taken ? or whose asse haue I taken ? or whom haue I defrauded ? whom haue I oppressed ? or of whose hand haue I receiued any bribe to blinde mine eyes therewith ? and I will restore it you .
And they said , Thou hast not defrauded vs , nor oppressed vs , neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand .
And hee said vnto them , The Lord is witnesse against you , and his Anointed is witnesse this day , that ye haue not found ought in my hand : And they answered , He is witnesse .
¶ And Samuel said vnto the people , It is the Lord that aduanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers vp out of the land of Egypt .
Now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord , of all the righteous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and your fathers .
When Iacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried vnto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , which brought foorth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
And when they forgat the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera captaine of the hoste of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
And they cried vnto the Lord , and said , Wee haue sinned , because we haue forsaken the Lord , and haue serued Baalim and Ashtaroth : but now deliuer vs out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serue thee .
And the Lord sent Ierubbaal , and Bedan , and Iephthah , and Samuel , and deliuered you out of the hand of your enemies on euery side , and yee dwelled safe .
And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , ye said vnto me , Nay , but a King shall reigne ouer vs , when the Lord your God was your King .
Now therefore , behold the King whom yee haue chosen , and whom yee haue desired : and behold , the Lord hath set a King ouer you .
If ye will feare the Lord , and serue him , and obey his voice , and not rebell against the Commandement of the Lord , then shall both ye and also the King that reigneth ouer you , continue following the Lord your God .
But if ye wil not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the Commandement of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
¶ Now therefore stand and see this great thing which the Lord will doe before your eyes .
Is it not wheat haruest to day ? I will call vnto the Lord , and hee shall send thunder and raine , that ye may perceiue and see that your wickednesse is great , which ye haue done in the sight of the Lord , in asking you a King .
So Samuel called vnto the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and raine that day : and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
And all the people said vnto Samuel , Pray for thy seruants vnto the Lord thy God , that we die not : for we haue added vnto all our sinnes , this euil , to aske vs a King .
¶ And Samuel saide vnto the people , Feare not : ( ye haue done al this wickednesse , yet turne not aside from following the Lord , but serue the Lord with all your heart :
And turne ye not aside , for then should ye goe after vaine things , which cannot profit , nor deliuer , for they are vaine . )
For the Lord wil not forsake his people , for his great Names sake : because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people .
Moreouer , as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the Lord , in ceasing to pray for you : but I will teach you the good and the right way .
Onely feare the Lord , and serue him in trueth with all your heart : for consider how great things he hath done for you .

Saul reigned one yeere , and when he had reigned two yeeres ouer Israel ,
Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel : whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash , and in mount Bethel , and a thousand were with Ionathan in Gibeah of Beniamin : and the rest of the people he sent euery man to his tent .
And Ionathan smote the garison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it : and Saul blew the trumpet thorowout all the land , saying , Let the Hebrewes heare .
And all Israel heard say , that Saul had smitten a garison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines : and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
¶ And the Philistines gathered themselues together , to fight with Israel , thirtie thousand charets , and sixe thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude , and they came vp , and pitched in Michmash , Eastward from Bethauen .
¶ And he taried seuen dayes , according to the set time that Samuel had appointed : but Samuel came not to Gilgal , and the people were scattered from him . And Saul said , Bring hither a burnt offring to me , and peace offrings . And he offered the burnt offering .
And it came to passe that assoone as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came , and Saul went out to meete him , that he might salute him .
¶ And Samuel said , What hast thou done ? And Saul said , Because I sawe that the people were scattered from me , and that thou camest not within the dayes appointed , and that the Philistines gathered themselues together to Michmash :
Therfore said I , The Philistines will come downe now vpon me to Gilgal , and I haue not made supplication vnto the Lord : I forced my selfe therefore , and offered a burnt offering .
And Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandement of the Lord thy God , which hee commanded thee : for now would the Lord haue established thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer .
But now thy kingdome shall not continue : the Lord hath sought him a man after his owne heart , and the Lord hath commanded him to bee captaine ouer his people , because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee .
And Samuel arose , and gate him vp from Gilgal , vnto Gibeah of Beniamin , and Saul numbred the people that were present with him , about sixe hundred men .
And Saul and Ionathan his sonne , and the people that were present with them , abode in Gibeah of Beniamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
¶ And the spoilers came out of the campe of the Philistines , in three companies : one company turned vnto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , vnto the land of Shual .
And another company turned the way to Bethoron : and another companie turned to the way of the border , that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wildernesse .
Yet they had a file for the mattocks , and for the coulters , and for the forkes , and for the axes , and to sharpen the goads .
So it came to passe in the day of battell , that there was neither sword nor speare found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Ionathan : but with Saul & with Ionathan his sonne was there found .
<NON-VERSE>
Now it came to passe vpon a day , that Ionathan the sonne of Saul said vnto the yong man that bare his armour , Come , and let vs goe ouer to the Philistines garison , that is on the other side : but hee told not his father .
And Saul taried in the vttermost part of Gibeah , vnder a Pomegranate tree , which is in Migron : and the people that were with him , were about sixe hundred men :
And Ahiah the sonne of Ahitub , Ichabods brother , the sonne of Phinehas , the sonne of Eli , the Lords Priest in Shiloh , wearing an Ephod : and the people knew not that Ionathan was gone . ¶ And betweene the passages , by which Ionathan sought to go ouer vnto the Philistines garison , there was a sharpe rocke on the one side , and a sharp rocke on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
The forefront of the one was situate Northward ouer against Michmash , and the other Southward ouer against Gibeah .
And Ionathan said to the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let vs goe ouer vnto the garison of these vncircumcised ; it may be that the Lord will worke for vs : for there is no restraint to the Lord , to saue by many , or by few .
And his armour bearer sayd vnto him , Doe all that is in thine heart : turne thee , behold , I am with thee , according to thy heart .
Then said Ionathan , Behold , we will passe ouer vnto these men , and we will discouer our selues vnto them .
If they say thus vnto vs , Tary vntill we come to you : then wee will stand still in our place , and will not goe vp vnto them .
But if they say thus , Come vp vnto vs : then we will goe vp ; for the Lord hath deliuered them into our hand : and this shall be a signe vnto vs .
And both of them discouered themselues vnto the garison of the Philistines : and the Philistines sayd , Behold , the Hebrewes come foorth out of the holes , where they had hid themselues .
And the men of the garison answered Ionathan and his armour bearer , and said , Come vp to vs , and wee will shew you a thing . And Ionathan said vnto his armour bearer , Come vp after me ; for the Lord hath deliuered them into the hand of Israel .
And Ionathan climed vp vpon his hands , and vpon his feete , and his armour bearer after him : and they fell before Ionathan ; and his armour bearer slew after him .
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Beniamin looked : and behold , the multitude melted away , and they went on beating downe one another .
Then said Saul vnto the people that were with him , Number now , and see who is gone from vs . And when they had numbred , behold , Ionathan and his armour bearer were not there .
And Saul said vnto Ahiah , Bring hither the Arke of God : ( for the Arke of God was at that time with the children of Israel . )
¶ And it came to passe while Saul talked vnto the Priest , that the noise that was in the hoste of the Philistines went on , and increased : And Saul said vnto the Priest , Withdraw thine hand .
And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselues , and they came to the battel , and behold , euery mans sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
Moreouer , the Hebrewes that were with the Philistines before that time , which went vp with them into the campe from the countrey round about ; euen they also turned to be with the Israelites , that were with Saul and Ionathan .
Likewise all the men of Israel , which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , euen they also followed hard after them in the battell .
So the Lord saued Israel that day : and the battell passed ouer vnto Beth - auen .
¶ And the men of Israel were distressed that day ; for Saul had adiured the people , saying , Cursed bee the man that eateth any foode vntill euening , that I may be auenged on mine enemies : so none of the people tasted any food .
And all they of the land came to a wood , and there was honie vpon the ground .
And when the people were come into the wood , behold , the honie dropped , but no man put his hand to his mouth : for the people feared the oath .
But Ionathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath ; wherefore he put foorth the ende of the rodde that was in his hand , and dipt it in an hony combe , and put his hand to his mouth , and his eyes were enlightened .
Then answered one of the people , and said , Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath , saying , Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day . And the people were faint .
Then said Ionathan , My father hath troubled the land : see , I pray you , how mine eyes haue beene enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honie :
How much more , if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoile of their enemies which they found ? for had there not beene now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ?
And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aiialon : and the people were very faint .
And the people flewe vpon the spoile , and tooke sheepe , and oxen , and calues , and slew them on the ground , and the people did eate them with the blood .
¶ Then they tolde Saul , saying , Behold , the people sinne against the Lord , in that they eate with the blood . And he said , Yee haue transgressed : roule a great stone vnto mee this day .
And Saul said , Disperse your selues among the people , and say vnto them , Bring me hither euery man his oxe , and euery man his sheepe , and slay them here , and eat , and sinne not against the Lord in eating with the blood . And all the people brought euery man his oxe with him that night , and slew them there .
And Saul built an altar vnto the Lord : the same was the first altar that he built vnto the Lord .
¶ And Saul saide , Let vs goe downe after the Philistines by night , and spoile them vntil the morning light , and let vs not leaue a man of them . And they said , Do whatsoeuer seemeth good vnto thee . Then said the priest , Let vs draw neere hither vnto God .
And Saul asked counsell of God , Shall I goe downe after the Philistines ? Wilt thou deliuer them into the hand of Israel ? But he answered him not that day .
And Saul said , Draw yee neere hither all the chiefe of the people : and know and see , wherein this sinne hath beene this day .
For as the Lord liueth , which saueth Israel , though it bee in Ionathan my sonne , he shall surely die : But there was not a man among all the people that answered him .
Then said he vnto all Israel , Be ye on one side , and I , and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other side . And the people said vnto Saul , Doe what seemeth good vnto thee .
Therefore Saul saide vnto the Lord God of Israel , Giue a perfect lot . And Saul and Ionathan were taken : but the people escaped .
And Saul said , Cast lots betweene me and Ionathan my sonne . And Ionathan was taken .
Then Saul said to Ionathan , Tell me what thou hast done . And Ionathan tolde him , and said , I did but taste a litle hony with the end of the rodde that was in mine hand , and loe , I must die .
And Saul answered , God do so , and more also : for thou shalt surely die , Ionathan .
And the people said vnto Saul , Shall Ionathan die , who hath wrought this great saluation in Israel ? God forbid : as the Lord liueth , there shal not one haire of his head fall to the ground : for hee hath wrought with God this day . So the people rescued Ionathan , that hee died not .
Then Saul went vp from following the Philistines : and the Philistines went to their owne place .
¶ So Saul tooke the kingdom ouer Israel , and fought against all his enemies on euery side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and whithersoeuer hee turned himselfe , he vexed them .
And he gathered an hoste , and smote the Amalekites , and deliuered Israel out of the handes of them that spoiled them .
Now the sonnes of Saul , were Ionathan , and Ishui , and Melchishua : and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the first borne Merab , and the name of the yonger Michal :
And the name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz , and the name of the captaine of his host was Abner , the sonne of Ner , Sauls vncle .
And Kish was the father of Saul , and Ner the father of Abner was the sonne of Abiel .
<NON-VERSE>
Samuel also saide vnto Saul , The Lord sent me to annoint thee to bee king ouer his people , ouer Israel : nowe therefore hearken thou vnto the voyce of the words of the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the way when he came vp from Egypt .
Now goe , and smite Amalek , and vtterly destroy all that they haue , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , oxe and sheepe , camell and asse .
And Saul gathered the people together , and numbred them in Telaim , two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand men of Iudah .
And Saul came to a citie of Amalek , and laid waite in the valley .
¶ And Saul saide vnto the Kenites , Goe , depart , get you downe from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them : for yee shewed kindnesse to all the children of Israel when they came vp out of Egypt . So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
And Saul smote the Amalekites from Hauilah , vntill thou commest to Shur , that is ouer against Egypt .
And hee tooke Agag the king of the Amalekites aliue , and vtterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
But Saul and the people spared Agag , and the best of the sheepe , and of the oxen , and of the fatlings , and the lambes , and all that was good , and would not vtterly destroy them : but euery thing that was vile , and refuse , that they destroyed vtterly .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord vnto Samuel , saying ;
It repenteth me that I haue set vp Saul to be king : for hee is turned backe from following me , and hath not performed my commandements . And it grieued Samuel ; and he cried vnto the Lord all night .
And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning , it was tolde Samuel , saying , Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set him vp a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone downe to Gilgal .
And Samuel came to Saul , and Saul said vnto him , Blessed be thou of the Lord : I haue performed the commandement of the Lord .
And Samuel said , What meaneth then this bleating of the sheepe in mine eares , and the lowing of the oxen which I heare ?
And Saul sayde , They haue brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheepe , and of the oxen , to sacrifice vnto the Lord thy God , and the rest we haue vtterly destroyed .
Then Samuel sayd vnto Saul , Stay , and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to mee this night . And he said vnto him , Say on .
And Samuel said , When thou wast litle in thine owne sight , wast thou not made the Head of the tribes of Israel , and the Lord anointed thee King ouer Israel ?
And the Lord sent thee on a iourney , and said , Goe , and vtterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites , and fight against them , vntill they be consumed .
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord , but didst flie vpon the spoile , and didst euill in the sight of the Lord ?
And Saul said vnto Samuel ; Yea , I haue obeyed the voice of the Lord , and haue gone the way which the Lord sent me , and haue brought Agag the king of Amalek , and haue vtterly destroyed the Amalekites .
But the people tooke of the spoile , sheepe and oxen , the chiefe of the things which should haue bene vtterly destroyed , to sacrifice vnto the Lord thy God in Gilgal .
And Samuel saide , Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold , to obey , is better then sacrifice : and to hearken , then the fat of rammes .
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubburnnesse is as iniquitie and idolatrie : because thou hast reiected the word of the Lord , he hath also reiected thee from being king .
¶ And Saul said vnto Samuel , I haue sinned : for I haue transgressed the Commandement of the Lord , and thy wordes ; because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
Now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sinne , and turne againe with me , that I may worship the Lord .
And Samuel said vnto Saul , I will not returne with thee : for thou hast reiected the word of the Lord , and the Lord hath reiected thee from being king ouer Israel .
And as Samuel turned about to goe away , he laid hold vpon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
And Samuel said vnto him , The Lord hath rent the kingdome of Israel from thee this day , and hath giuen it to a neighbour of thine , that is better then thou .
And also the strength of Israel will not lie , nor repent : for he is not a man that he should repent .
Then he said , I haue sinned ; yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the Elders of my people , and before Israel , and turne againe with me , that I may worship the Lord thy God .
So Samuel turned againe after Saul , and Saul worshipped the Lord .
¶ Then said Samuel , Bring you hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites : and Agag came vnto him delicately . And Agag said , Surely the bitternesse of death is past .
And Samuel said , As thy sword hath made women childlesse , so shall thy mother bee childlesse among women . And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal .
¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah , and Saul went vp to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord said vnto Samuel , How long wilt thou mourne for Saul , seeing I haue reiected him from reigning ouer Israel ? Fill thine horne with oile , and goe , I will send thee to Iesse the Bethlehemite : for I haue prouided mee a King among his sonnes .
And Samuel said , How can I goe ? if Saul heare it , he will kill mee . And the Lord said , Take an heifer with thee , and say , I am come to sacrifice to the Lord .
And call Iesse to the sacrifice , and I will shew thee what thou shalt doe : and thou shalt anoynt vnto mee him whom I name vnto thee .
And Samuel did that which the Lord spake , and came to Bethlehem : and the elders of the towne trembled at his comming , and said , Commest thou peaceably ?
And hee said , Peaceably : I am come to sacrifice vnto the Lord : sanctifie your selues , and come with me to the sacrifice : and he sanctified Iesse , and his sonnes , and called them to the sacrifice .
¶ And it came to passe when they were come , that he looked on Eliab , and said , Surely the Lords anointed is before him .
But the Lord said vnto Samuel , Looke not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature , because I haue refused him : for the Lord seeth not , as man seeth ; For man looketh on the outward appearance , but the Lord looketh on the heart .
Againe Iesse made seuen of his sonnes to passe before Samuel ; and Samuel said vnto Iesse , The Lord hath not chosen these .
And Samuel saide vnto Iesse , Are here all thy children ? And he said , There remaineth yet the yongest , and behold , he keepeth the sheepe . And Samuel said vnto Iesse , Send , and fetch him : for we will not sit downe , till hee come hither .
And he sent , and brought him in : now he was ruddy , and withal of a beautifull countenance , and goodly to looke to : And the Lord said , Arise , anoint him : for this is he .
Then Samuel tooke the horne of oile , and annointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid , from that day forward : So Samuel rose vp and went to Ramah .
¶ But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , and an euil spirit from the Lord troubled him .
And Sauls seruants said vnto him , Behold now , an euill spirit from God troubleth thee .
Let our lord now command thy seruants which are before thee , to seeke out a man , who is a cunning player on an harpe : and it shall come to passe when the euill spirit from God is vpon thee , that hee shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well .
And Saul said vnto his seruants , Prouide mee now a man , that can play well , and bring him to me .
Then answered one of the seruants , and said , Behold , I haue seene a sonne of Iesse the Bethlehemite , that is cunning in playing , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of warre , and prudent in matters , and a comely person , and the Lord is with him .
¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Iesse , and said , Send me Dauid thy sonne , which is with the sheepe .
And Iesse tooke an asse laden with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a kid , and sent them by Dauid his sonne vnto Saul .
And Dauid came to Saul , and stood before him : and hee loued him greatly , and hee became his armour bearer .
And Saul sent to Iesse , saying , Let Dauid , I pray thee , stand before me : for hee hath found fauour in my sight .

Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battell , and were gathered together at Shochoh , which belongeth to Iudah , and pitched betweene Shochoh and Azekah , in Ephes - Dammim .
And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of Elah , and set the battell in aray against the Philistines .
And the Philistines stood on a mountaine on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountaine on the other side : and there was a valley betweene them .
¶ And there went out a champion out of the campe of the Philistines , named Goliath of Gath : whose height was sixe cubites and a span .
And he had an helmet of brasse vpon his head , and he was armed with a coate of male : and the weight of the coat was fiue thousand shekels of brasse .
And he had greaues of brasse vpon his legs , and a target of brasse betweene his shoulders .
And the staffe of his speare was like a weauers beame , and his speares head weighed sixe hundred shekels of yron : and one bearing a shield , went before him .
And hee stood and cried vnto the armies of Israel , and said vnto them , Why are yee come out to set your battell in aray ? am not I a Philistine , and you seruants to Saul ? chuse you a man for you , and let him come downe to me .
If he be able to fight with mee , and to kill me , then will we be your seruants : but if I preuaile against him , and kill him , then shall yee be our seruants , and serue vs .
And the Philistine said , I defie the armies of Israel this day ; giue me a man , that we may fight together .
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine , they were dismayed , and greatly afraid .
¶ Now Dauid was the sonne of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Iudah , whose name was Iesse , and hee had eight sonnes : and the man went among men for an old man in the dayes of Saul . And the three eldest sonnes of Iesse went , and followed Saul to the battell : and the names of his three sonnes that went to the battell , were , Eliab the first borne , and next vnto him , Abinadab , and the third , Shammah .
And Dauid was the yongest : and the three eldest followed Saul .
But Dauid went , and returned from Saul , to feed his fathers sheepe at Bethlehem .
And the Philistine drewe neere , morning and euening , and presented himselfe forty dayes .
And Iesse said vnto Dauid his sonne , Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corne , and these ten loaues , and run to the campe to thy brethren .
And carie these ten cheeses vnto the Captaine of their thousand , and looke how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge .
Now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
¶ And Dauid rose vp earely in the morning , and left the sheepe with a keeper , and tooke , and went , as Iesse had commanded him ; and he came to the trench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battell .
For Israel and the Philistines had put the battel in aray , army against armie .
And Dauid left his cariage in the hand of the keeper of the cariage , and ranne into the armie , and came and saluted his brethren .
And as he talked with them , behold , there came vp the champion ( the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name ) out of the armies of the Philistines , and spake according to the same words : and Dauid heard them .
And all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sore afraid .
And the men of Israel said , Haue yee seene this man that is come vp ? Surely to defie Israel is he come vp : and it shall be that the man who killeth him , the king wil enrich him with great riches , and will giue him his daughter , and make his fathers house free in Israel .
And Dauid spake to the men that stood by him , saying ; What shall bee done to the man that killeth this Philistine ; and taketh away the reproch from Israel ? for who is this vncircumcised Philistine , that he should defie the armies of the liuing God ?
And the people answered him after this maner , saying , So shall it be done to the man that killeth him .
¶ And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men , and Eliabs anger was kindled against Dauid , and he said , Why camest thou down hither ? and with whom hast thou left those few sheepe in the wildernesse ? I know thy pride , and the naughtinesse of thine heart ; for thou art come downe , that thou mightest see the battell .
And Dauid saide , What haue I now done ? Is there not a cause ?
¶ And hee turned from him towards another , and spake after the same maner : and the people answered him againe after the former maner .
And when the words were heard which Dauid spake , they rehearsed them before Saul : and he sent for him .
¶ And Dauid said to Saul , Let no mans heart faile , because of him : thy seruant will goe and fight with this Philistine .
And Saul said to Dauid , Thou art not able to goe against this Philistine , to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of warre from his youth .
And Dauid said vnto Saul , Thy seruant kept his fathers sheepe , and there came a Lyon , and a Beare , and tooke a lambe out of the flocke :
And I went out after him , and smote him , and deliuered it out of his mouth : and when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard , and smote him , and slew him .
Thy seruant slew both the Lyon and the Beare : and this vncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , seeing he hath defied the armies of the liuing God .
Dauid saide moreouer , The Lord that deliuered me out of the paw of the Lyon , and out of the pawe of the Beare , he will deliuer me out of the hand of this Philistine . And Saul said vnto Dauid , Goe , and the Lord be with thee .
¶ And Saul armed Dauid with his armour , and hee put an helmet of brasse vpon his head , also he armed him with a coat of male .
And Dauid girded his sword vpon his armour , and he assayed to goe , for he had not proued it : and Dauid said vnto Saul , I cannot goe with these : for I haue not proued them . And Dauid put them off him .
And hee tooke his staffe in his hand , and chose him fiue smoothe stones out of the brooke , and put them in a shepheards bag which he had , euen in a scrip , and his sling was in his hande , and he drew neere to the Philistine . And the Philistine came on and drew neere vnto Dauid , and the man that bare the shield , went before him .
And when the Philistine looked about , and saw Dauid , hee disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a faire countenance .
And the Philistine said vnto Dauid , Am I a dog , that thou commest to me with staues ? and the Philistine cursed Dauid by his gods . And the Philistine said to Dauid , Come to me , and I will giue thy flesh vnto the foules of the aire , and to the beasts of the field .
Then said Dauid to the Philistine , Thou commest to mee with a sword , and with a speare , and with a shield : but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of hostes , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied .
This day wil the Lord deliuer thee into mine hand , and I will smite thee , and take thine head from thee , and I wil giue the carkeises of the host of the Philistines this day vnto the foules of the aire , and to the wild beasts of the earth , that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel .
And all this assembly shal know that the Lord saueth not with sword & speare ( for the battell is the Lords ) and he will giue you into our hands .
And it came to passe when the Philistine arose , and came , and drewe nigh to meet Dauid , that Dauid hasted , and ran toward the armie to meete the Philistine .
And Dauid put his hande in his bag , and tooke thence a stone , and slang it , & smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunke into his forehead , and he fell vpon his face to the earth .
So Dauid preuailed ouer the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him , but there was no sword in the hande of Dauid .
Therefore Dauid ran and stood vpon the Philistine , and tooke his sword , and drewe it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . And when the Philistines sawe their champion was dead , they fled .
And the men of Israel , and of Iudah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , vntill thou come to the valley , and to the gates of Ekron : and the wounded of the Philistines fell downe by the way to Shaaraim , euen vnto Gath , and vnto Ekron .
And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they spoiled their tents .
And Dauid tooke the head of the Philistine , and brought it to Ierusalem , but he put his armour in his tent .
¶ And when Saul sawe Dauid goe forth against the Philistine , he sayd vnto Abner the captaine of the hoste , Abner , whose sonne is this youth ? And Abner said , As thy soule liueth , O king , I cannot tell .
And the king said , Enquire thou whose sonne the stripling is .
And as Dauid returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner tooke him , & brought him before Saul , with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when hee made an ende of speaking vnto Saul , that the soule of Ionathan was knit with the soule of Dauid , and Ionathan loued him as his owne soule .
And Saul tooke him that day , and would let him go no more home to his fathers house .
Then Ionathan and Dauid made a couenant , because he loued him as his owne soule .
And Ionathan stript himselfe of the robe that was vpon him , and gaue it to Dauid , and his garments , euen to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
And the women answered one another as they played , and said , Saul hath slaine his thousands , and Dauid his ten thousands .
And Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him , and he sayd , They haue ascribed vnto Dauid tenne thousands , and to me they haue ascribed but thousands : and what can he haue more , but the kingdome ?
And Saul eyed Dauid from that day , and forward .
¶ And it came to passe on the morrow , that the euill spirit from God came vpon Saul , and he prophecied in the midst of the house : and Dauid played with his hand , as at other times : and there was a iauelin in Sauls hand .
And Saul cast the iauelin ; for hee said , I will smite Dauid euen to the wall with it : and Dauid auoided out of his presence twice .
Wherefore when Saul saw that hee behaued himselfe very wisely , hee was afraid of him .
But all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid , because hee went out and came in before them .
¶ And Saul said to Dauid , Behold , my elder daughter Merab , her will I giue thee to wife : onely be thou valiant for me , and fight the Lords battels : for Saul said , Let not mine hand be vpon him , but let the hand of the Philistines be vpon him .
And Dauid said vnto Saul , Who am I ? and what is my life , or my fathers family in Israel , that I should be sonne in law to the king ?
But it came to passe at the time when Merab Sauls daughter should haue beene giuen to Dauid , that shee was giuen vnto Adriel the Meholathite to wife .
And Michal Sauls daughter loued Dauid : and they tolde Saul , and the thing pleased him .
And Saul said , I will giue him her , that she may be a snare to him , and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him . Wherefore Saul said to Dauid , Thou shalt this day be my sonne in law , in the one of the twaine .
¶ And Saul commanded his seruants , saying , Commune with Dauid secretly , and say , Behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his seruants loue thee : now therefore be the kings sonne in law .
And Saul said , Thus shall yee say to Dauid , The King desireth not any dowrie , but an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistines , to be auenged of the kings enemies . But Saul thought to make Dauid fal by the hand of the Philistines .
And when his seruants told Dauid these wordes , it pleased Dauid well to be the kings sonne in lawe : and the dayes were not expired .
Wherefore Dauid arose , hee and his men , and slew of the Philistines two hundred men , and Dauid brought their foreskinnes , and they gaue them in full tale to the king , that hee might be the kings sonne in law : and Saul gaue him Michal his daughter to wife .
¶ And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with Dauid , and that Michal Sauls daughter loued him .
And Saul was yet the more afraid of Dauid ; and Saul became Dauids enemie continually .
<NON-VERSE> And Saul spake to Ionathan his sonne , and to all his seruants , that they should kill Dauid .
But Ionathan Sauls sonne delighted much in Dauid , and Ionathan told Dauid , saying , Saul my father seeketh to kill thee : Now therefore , I pray thee , take heed to thy selfe vntill the morning , and abide in a secret place , and hide thy selfe :
And I will goe out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father of thee , and what I see , that I will tell thee .
¶ And Ionathan spake good of Dauid vnto Saul his father , and said vnto him , Let not the King sinne against his seruant , against Dauid : because hee hath not sinned against thee , and because his workes haue bene to thee ward very good .
For he did put his life in his hand , and slew the Philistine , & the Lord wrought a great saluation for all Israel : thou sawest it , and didst reioyce : Wherefore then wilt thou sinne against innocent blood , to slay Dauid without a cause ?
And Saul hearkened vnto the voyce of Ionathan ; and Saul sware , As the Lord liueth , he shall not be slaine .
And Ionathan called Dauid , and Ionathan shewed him all those things : and Ionathan brought Dauid to Saul , and he was in his presence , as in times past .
¶ And there was warre againe , and Dauid went out , and fought with the Philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter , & they fled from him .
And the euill spirit from the Lord was vpon Saul , as he sate in his house with his iauelin in his hand : and Dauid played with his hand .
And Saul sought to smite Dauid euen to the wall with the iauelin : but hee slipt away out of Sauls presence , and he smote the iauelin into the wall : and Dauid fled , and escaped that night .
Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning : and Michal Dauids wife tolde him , saying , If thou saue not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slaine .
¶ So Michal let Dauid downe thorow a window : and hee went and fled , and escaped .
And Michal tooke an image , and laid it in the bedde , and put a pillow of goats haire for his bolster , and couered it with a cloth .
And when Saul sent messengers to take Dauid , she said , He is sicke .
And Saul sent the messengers againe to see Dauid , saying , Bring him vp to me in the bedde , that I may slay him .
And when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goates haire for his bolster .
And Saul said vnto Michal , Why hast thou deceiued me so , and sent away mine enemie , that he is escaped ? And Michal answered Saul , Hee said vnto me , Let mee goe ; Why should I kill thee ?
¶ So Dauid fledde , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him : and hee and Samuel went , and dwelt in Naioth .
And it was told Saul , saying , Behold , Dauid is at Naioth in Ramah .
And Saul sent messengers to take Dauid : and when they sawe the company of the Prophets prophecying , and Samuel standing as appointed ouer them , the Spirit of God was vpon the messengers of Saul , and they also prophecied .
And when it was tolde Saul , he sent other messengers , and they prophecied likewise : and Saul sent messengers againe the third time , and they prophecied also .
Then went hee also to Ramah , and came to a great well that is in Sechu : and he asked , and said , Where are Samuel and Dauid ? And one said , Behold , they be at Naioth in Ramah .
And hee went thither to Naioth in Ramah : and the Spirit of God was vpon him also , and he went on and prophecied vntill hee came to Naioth in Ramah :
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said before Ionathan , What haue I done ? what is mine iniquity ? and what is my sinne before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
And he said vnto him , God forbid , thou shalt not die ; beholde , my father will doe nothing , either great or small , but that he will shew it me : and why should my father hide this thing from me ? it is not so .
And Dauid sware moreouer , and said , Thy father certeinly knoweth that I haue found grace in thine eyes , and he sayth , Let not Ionathan know this , lest he be grieued : but truely , as the Lord liueth , and as thy soule liueth , there is but a step betweene me & death .
Then said Ionathan vnto Dauid , Whatsoeuer thy soule desireth , I will euen doe it for thee .
And Dauid said vnto Ionathan , Behold , to morrow is the new moone , and I should not faile to sit with the king at meate : but let me goe , that I may hide my selfe in the fields vnto the third day at euen .
If thy father at all misse me , then say , Dauid earnestly asked leaue of me that he might runne to Bethlehem his citie : for there is a yeerely sacrifice there for all the family .
If he say thus , It is well , thy seruant shall haue peace : but if he be very wroth , then be sure that euill is determined by him .
Therefore thou shalt deale kindly with thy seruant , for thou hast brought thy seruant into a couenant of the Lord with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in me iniquitie , slay me thy selfe : for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father ?
And Ionathan said , Farre be it from thee : for if I knew certainely that euill were determined by my father to come vpon thee , then would not I tell it thee ?
Then said Dauid to Ionathan , Who shall tell me ? or what if thy father answere thee roughly ?
¶ And Ionathan said vnto Dauid , Come , and let vs goe out into the field . And they went out both of them into the field .
And Ionathan said vnto Dauid , O Lord God of Israel , when I haue sounded my father , about to morrow any time , or the third day , and behold , if there be good toward Dauid , and I then send not vnto thee , and shew it thee ;
The Lord doe so and much more to Ionathan : but if it please my father to doe thee euill , then I wil shew it thee , and send thee away , that thou mayest goe in peace , and the Lord be with thee , as hee hath beene with my father .
And thou shalt not onely while yet I liue , shew me the kindnesse of the Lord , that I die not : But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindnesse from my house for euer : no not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of Dauid , euery one from the face of the earth .
So Ionathan made a couenant with the house of Dauid , saying , Let the Lord euen require it at the hande of Dauids enemies .
And when thou hast stayed three dayes , then thou shalt goe downe quickly , and come to the place where thou diddest hide thy selfe , when the businesse was in hand , and shalt remaine by the stone Ezel .
And I will shoot three arrowes on the side thereof , as though I shot at a marke .
And behold , I will send a ladde , saying , Goe , find out the arrowes . If I expresly say vnto the lad , Behold , the arrowes are on this side of thee , take them : then come thou , for there is peace to thee , and no hurt , as the Lord liueth .
But if I say thus vnto the yong man , Behold , the arrowes are beyond thee : goe thy way , for the Lord hath sent thee away .
And as touching the matter which thou and I haue spoken of , behold , the Lord be betweene thee and mee for euer .
¶ So Dauid hid himselfe in the field : and when the newe moone was come , the king sate him downe to eate meate .
And the king sate vpon his seate , as at other times , euen vpon a seate by the wall : and Ionathan arose , and Abner sate by Sauls side , and Dauids place was emptie .
Neuerthelesse , Saul spake not any thing that day : for hee thought , Some thing hath befallen him , hee is not cleane ; surely he is not cleane .
And it came to passe on the morrow which was the second day of the moneth , that Dauids place was emptie : and Saul said vnto Ionathan his sonne , Wherefore commeth not the sonne of Iesse to meat , neither yesterday nor to day ?
And Ionathan answered Saul , Dauid earnestly asked leaue of me , to goe to Bethlehem .
And he said , Let me goe , I pray thee , for our familie hath a sacrifice in the citie , and my brother , hee hath commanded mee to be there : and now if I haue found fauour in thine eyes , let me get away , I pray thee , and see my brethren : Therefore he commeth not vnto the kings table .
Then Sauls anger was kindled against Ionathan , and hee said vnto him , Thou sonne of the peruerse rebellious woman , doe not I know that thou hast chosen the sonne of Iesse to thine owne confusion , and vnto the confusion of thy mothers nakednesse ?
For as long as the sonne of Iesse liueth vpon the ground , thou shalt not be stablished , nor thy kingdome : wherefore now send and fetch him vnto mee , for he shall surely die .
And Ionathan answered Saul his father , and said vnto him , Wherefore shall hee be slaine ? what hath hee done ?
And Saul cast a iauelin at him to smite him , whereby Ionathan knewe that it was determined of his father to slay Dauid .
So Ionathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eate no meat the second day of the moneth : for hee was grieued for Dauid , because his father had done him shame .
¶ And it came to passe in the morning , that Ionathan went out into the field , at the time appointed with Dauid , and a little ladde with him .
And he said vnto his lad , Runne , finde out now the arrowes which I shoote . And as the ladde ranne , he shot an arrow beyond him .
And when the ladde was come to the place of the arrow , which Ionathan had shot , Ionathan cryed after the ladde , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
And Ionathan cryed after the ladde , Make speed , haste , stay not . And Ionathans ladde gathered vp the arrowes , and came to his master .
But the lad knew not any thing : onely Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter .
And Ionathan gaue his artillery vnto his ladde , and said vnto him , Goe , cary them to the citie .
¶ And assoone as the ladde was gone , Dauid arose out of a place toward the South , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himselfe three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , vntill Dauid exceeded .
<NON-VERSE> Then came Dauid to Nob , to Ahimelech the Priest , and Ahimelech was afraide at the meeting of Dauid , and said vnto him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech the Priest , The king hath commanded me a businesse , and hath said vnto me , Let no man know any thing of the businesse whereabout I send thee , and what I haue commanded thee : and I haue appointed my seruants to such and such a place .
And Dauid answered the Priest , and said vnto him , Of a trueth women haue beene kept from vs about these three dayes , since I came out , and the vessels of the young men are holy , and the bread is in a manner common , yea , though it were sanctified this day in the vessell .
So the Priest gaue him hallowed bread ; for there was no bread there , but the Shewbread that was taken from before the Lord , to put hote bread in the day when it was taken away .
Now a certaine man of the seruants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord , and his name was Doeg an Edomite , the chiefest of the heardmen that belonged to Saul .
¶ And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech , And is there not here vnder thine hand speare or sword ? for I haue neither brought my sword nor my weapons with mee , because the kings businesse required haste .
And the Priest said , The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whome thou slewest in the valley of Elah , behold , it is heere wrapt in a cloth behinde the Ephod : if thou wilt take that , take it ; for there is no other saue that , here . And Dauid saide , There is none like that , giue it me .
¶ And Dauid arose , and fled that day , for feare of Saul , and went to Achish , the king of Gath .
And the seruants of Achish sayd vnto him , Is not this Dauid the king of the land ? Did they not sing one to another of him in daunces , saying , Saul hath slaine his thousands , and Dauid his ten thousands ?
And Dauid layd vp these wordes in his heart , and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
And he changed his behauiour before them , and fained himselfe mad in their hands , and scrabled on the doores of the gate , and let his spittle fall downe vpon his beard .
Then saide Achish vnto his seruants , Loe , you see the man is mad : wherefore then haue yee brought him to mee ?
<NON-VERSE>
Dauid therefore departed thence , and escaped to the caue Adullam : and when his brethren , and all his fathers house heard it , they went downe thither to him .
And euery one that was in distresse , and euery one that was in debt , and euery one that was discontented , gathered themselues vnto him , and he became a captaine ouer them : and there were with him about foure hundred men .
¶ And Dauid went thence to Mizpeh of Moab ; and he said vnto the king of Moab , Let my father , and my mother , I pray thee , come foorth , and be with you , till I know what God will doe for me .
And he brought them before the king of Moab : and they dwelt with him all the while that Dauid was in the hold .
¶ And the Prophet Gad said vnto Dauid , Abide not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of Iudah . Then Dauid departed , and came into the forrest of Hareth .
¶ When Saul heard that Dauid was discouered , and the men that were with him : ( now Saul abode in Gibeah vnder a tree in Ramah , hauing his speare in his hand , and all his seruants were standing about him . )
Then Saul saide vnto his seruants that stood about him , Heare now , ye Beniamites : Will the sonne of Iesse giue euery one of you fields , and Uineyards , and make you all captaines of thousands , and captaines of hundreds :
That all of you haue conspired against me , and there is none that sheweth mee , that my sonne hath made a league with the sonne of Iesse , and there is none of you that is sory for me , or sheweth vnto me that my sonne hath stirred vp my seruant against me , to lye in wait , as at this day ?
¶ Then answered Doeg the Edomite , ( which was set ouer the seruants of Saul ) and saide , I saw the sonne of Iesse comming to Nob , to Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitub .
And hee enquired of the Lord for him , and gaue him victuals , and gaue him the sword of Goliath the Philistine .
Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the Priest , the sonne of Ahitub , and all his fathers house , the Priests that were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
And Saul said , Heare now thou sonne of Ahitub : and hee answered , Here I am , my lord .
And Saul saide vnto him , Why haue ye conspired against me , thou and the sonne of Iesse , in that thou hast giuen him bread , and a sword , and hast enquired of God for him , that he should rise against mee , to lye in waite , as at this day ?
Then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , And who is so faithfull among all thy seruants , as Dauid , which is the kings sonne in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?
Did I then beginne to enquire of God for him ? be it farre from mee : let not the king impute any thing vnto his seruant , nor to all the house of my father : for thy seruant knew nothing of all this , lesse or more .
And the king saide , Thou shalt surely die , Ahimelech , thou , and all thy fathers house .
¶ And the king said vnto the footmen that stood about him , Turne and slay the Priests of the Lord , because their hand also is with Dauid , and because they knew when he fled , and did not shew it to mee . But the seruants of the king would not put foorth their hand to fall vpon the Priestes of the Lord .
And the king said to Doeg , Turne thou and fall vpon the Priests . And Doeg the Edomite turned , and hee fell vpon the Priests , and slew on that day foure score and fiue persons that did weare a linnen Ephod .
And Nob the citie of the Priests smote he with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen and asses , and sheepe , with the edge of the sword .
¶ And one of the sonnes of Ahimelech , the sonne of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped and fled after Dauid :
And Abiathar shewed Dauid that Saul had slaine the Lords Priests .
And Dauid said vnto Abiathar , I knew it that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul : I haue occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers house .
<NON-VERSE>
Then they told Dauid , saying , Beholde , the Philistines fight against Keilah , and they rob the threshing floores .
Therefore Dauid enquired of the Lord , saying , Shall I go and smite these Philistines ? And the Lord said vnto Dauid , Goe , and smite the Philistines , and saue Keilah .
And Dauids men said vnto him , Behold , we be afraid here in Iudah : how much more then if wee come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ?
Then Dauid enquired of the Lord yet againe : And the Lord answered him , and said , Arise , go down to Keilah : for I will deliuer the Philistines into thine hand .
So Dauid and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistins , and brought away their cattell , and smote them with a great slaughter : so Dauid saued the inhabitants of Keilah .
And it came to passe when Abiathar the sonne of Ahimelech fled to Dauid to Keilah , that hee came downe with an Ephod in his hand .
¶ And it was told Saul that Dauid was come to Keilah : and Saul said , God hath deliuered him into mine hand : for he is shut in , by entring into a towne that hath gates and barres .
And Saul called all the people together to warre , to goe downe to Keilah , to besiege Dauid , and his men .
¶ And Dauid knewe that Saul secretly practised mischiefe against him , and hee said to Abiathar the Priest , Bring hither the Ephod .
Then saide Dauid , O Lord God of Israel , thy seruant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah , to destroy the citie for my sake .
Will the men of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hande ? will Saul come downe , as thy seruant hath heard , O Lord God of Israel ? I beseech thee tell thy seruant . And the Lord said , He will come downe .
Then said Dauid , Will the men of Keilah deliuer me , and my men , into the hand of Saul ? And the Lord said , They will deliuer thee vp .
¶ Then Dauid and his men , which were about sixe hundred , arose , and departed out of Keilah , and went whithersoeuer they could goe : and it was told Saul that Dauid was escaped from Keilah , and hee forbare to goe foorth .
And Dauid abode in the wildernesse in strong holds , and remained in a mountaine in the wildernes of Ziph : and Saul sought him euery day , but God deliuered him not into his hand .
And Dauid saw that Saul was come out to seeke his life : and Dauid was in the wildernes of Ziph in a wood .
¶ And Ionathan Sauls sonne arose , & went to Dauid into the wood , and strengthened his hand in God .
And he said vnto him , Feare not ; for the hand of Saul my father shall not finde thee , and thou shalt be king ouer Israel , and I shall be next vnto thee : and that also Saul my father knoweth .
And they two made a couenant before the Lord : and Dauid abode in the wood , and Ionathan went to his house .
¶ Then came vp the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not Dauid hide himselfe with vs in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the South of Ieshimon ?
Now therefore , O king , come downe according to all the desire of thy soule to come downe , and our part shall be to deliuer him into the kings hand .
And Saul said , Blessed be yee of the Lord , for yee haue compassion on me .
Goe , I pray you , prepare yet , and know , and see his place where his haunt is , and who hath seene him there : for it is told mee that he dealeth very subtilly .
See therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himselfe , and come ye againe to me with the certainty , and I will goe with you : and it shall come to passe , if he be in the land , that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Iudah .
And they arose , & went to Ziph before Saul : but Dauid and his men were in the wildernesse of Maon , in the plaine on the South of Ieshimon .
Saul also and his men went to seeke him , and they told Dauid : wherefore he came downe into a rocke , and abode in the wildernesse of Maon : and when Saul heard that , he pursued after Dauid in the wildernes of Maon .
And Saul went on this side of the mountaine , and Dauid and his men on that side of the mountaine : and Dauid made haste to get away for feare of Saul : for Saul and his men compassed Dauid and his men round about to take them .
¶ But there came a messenger vnto Saul , saying , Haste thee , and come : for the Philistines haue inuaded the land .
Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after Dauid , & went against the Philistines ; therefore they called that place Sela - Hammahlekoth .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when Saul was returned from folowing the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , Behold , Dauid is in the wildernesse En - gedi .
Then Saul tooke three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to secke Dauid and his men vpon the rockes of the wilde goates .
And hee came to the sheepe coates by the way , where was a caue , and Saul went in to couer his feete : and Dauid and his men remained in the sides of the caue . And the men of Dauid sayd vnto him , Beholde the day of which the Lord sayd vnto thee , Behold , I wil deliuer thine enemy into thine hand , that thou mayest doe to him as it shall seeme good vnto thee . Then Dauid arose , and cut off the skirt of Sauls robe priuily .
And it came to passe afterward , that Dauids heart smote him , because he had cut off Sauls skirt .
And hee sayd vnto his men , The Lord forbid that I should doe this thing vnto my master the Lords Anoynted , to stretch forth mine hand against him , seeing he is the Anoynted of the Lord .
So Dauid stayed his seruants with these wordes , and suffered them not to rise against Saul : but Saul rose vp out of the caue , and went on his way .
Dauid also rose afterward , and went out of the caue , and cryed after Saul , saying , My lord the king . And when Saul looked behinde him , Dauid stouped with his face to the earth , and bowed himselfe .
¶ And Dauid said to Saul , Wherfore hearest thou mens words , saying , Behold , Dauid seeketh thy hurt ?
Behold , this day thine eyes haue seene , how that the Lord had deliuered thee to day into mine hand in the caue : and some bade me kill thee , but mine eye spared thee , and I said , I will not put foorth mine hand against my lord , for hee is the Lords Anointed .
Moreouer my father , See , yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand : for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe , and killed thee not , know thou and see , that there is neither euill nor transgression in mine hand , and I haue not sinned against thee ; yet thou huntest my soule , to take it .
The Lord iudge betweene me and thee , and the Lord auenge me of thee : but mine hand shall not be vpon thee .
As saith the prouerbe of the ancients , Wickednesse proceedeth from the wicked : but mine hand shall not be vpon thee .
After whom is the king of Israel come out ? after whom doest thou pursue ? After a dead dogge , after a flea .
The Lord therfore be Iudge , and iudge betweene me and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and deliuer me out of thine hand .
¶ And it came to passe when Dauid had made an ende of speaking these words vnto Saul , that Saul said , Is this thy voice , my sonne Dauid ? And Saul lift vp his voice , and wept .
And he said to Dauid , Thou art more righteous then I : for thou hast rewarded mee good , whereas I haue rewarded thee euill .
And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the Lord had deliuered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
For if a man finde his enemie , will hee let him goe well away ? wherefore the Lord reward thee good , for that thou hast done vnto me this day .
And now behold , I know well that thou shalt surely be King , and that the kingdome of Israel shall be established in thine hand .
Sweare now therefore vnto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seede after mee , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house .
<NON-VERSE>
And Samuel died , and all the Israelites were gathered together , and lamented him , and buried him in his house at Ramah . And Dauid arose , & went downe to the wildernesse of Paran .
And there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel , and the man was very great , and hee had three thousand sheepe , and a thousand goates : and he was shearing his sheepe in Carmel .
Now the name of the man was Nabal , and the name of his wife , Abigail : and shee was a woman of good vnderstanding , and of a beautifull countenance : but the man was churlish and euill in his doings , and hee was of the house of Caleb .
¶ And Dauid heard in the wildernesse , that Nabal did sheare his sheepe .
And Dauid sent out ten yong men , and Dauid said vnto the young men , Get you vp to Carmel , and goe to Nabal , and greete him in my name ;
And thus shall ye say to him that liueth in prosperitie , Peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be vnto all that thou hast .
And now , I haue heard that thou hast shearers : now thy shepheards which were with vs , wee hurt them not , neither was there ought missing vnto them , all the while they were in Carmel .
Aske thy yong men , and they will shew thee : wherefore let the yong men finde fauour in thine eyes : ( for we come in a good day ) giue , I pray thee , whatsoeuer commeth to thine hand , vnto thy seruants , and to thy sonne Dauid .
And when Dauids yong men came , they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of Dauid , and ceased .
¶ And Nabal answered Dauids seruants , and said , Who is Dauid ? and who is the sonne of Iesse ? There bee many seruants now a daies that breake away euery man from his master .
Shall I then take my bread and my water , and my flesh that I haue killed for my shearers , and giue it vnto men , whom I know not whence they bee ?
So Dauids yong men turned their way , and went againe , and came and told him all those sayings .
And Dauid said vnto his men , Gird you on euery man his sword . And they girded on euery man his sword , and Dauid also girded on his sword : and there went vp after Dauid about foure hundred men , and two hundred abode by the stuffe .
¶ But one of the yong men told Abigail Nabals wife , saying , Behold , Dauid sent messengers out of the wildernesse to salute our master : and he railed on them .
But the men were very good vnto vs , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing as long as wee were conuersant with them , when we were in the fields .
They were a wall vnto vs both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping sheepe .
Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt doe : for euill is determined against our master , and against all his houshold : for he is such a sonne of Belial , that a man cannot speake to him .
¶ Then Abigail made haste , and tooke two hundred loaues , and two bottles of wine , and fiue sheepe readie dressed , and fiue measures of parched corne , and an hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figges , and laid them on asses .
And she said vnto her seruants , Goe on before me , behold , I come after you : but she told not her husband Nabal .
And it was so as she rode on the asse , that she came downe by the couert of the hill , and behold , Dauid and his men came downe against her , and she met them .
( Now Dauid had said , Surely in vaine haue I kept all that this fellow hath in the wildernesse , so that nothing was missed of all that pertained vnto him : and he hath requited me euil for good .
So and more also doe God vnto the enemies of Dauid , if I leaue of all that pertaine to him by the morning light , any that pisseth against the wall . ) And when Abigail saw Dauid , she hasted , and lighted off the asse , and fell before Dauid on her face , and bowed her selfe to the ground ,
And fell at his feet , and said , Upon me , my lord , vpon me let this iniquitie be , and let thine handmaid , I pray thee , speake in thine audience , and heare the words of thine handmaid .
Let not my lord , I pray thee , regard this man of Belial , euen Nabal : for as his name is , so is he : Nabal is his name , and folly is with him : But I thine handmaid saw not the yong men of my lord , whom thou didst send .
Now therefore , my lord , as the Lord liueth , and as thy soule liueth , seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from comming to shed blood , and from auenging thy selfe with thine owne hand : now let thine enemies and they that secke euill to my lord , bee as Nabal .
And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought vnto my lord , let it euen be giuen vnto the yong men that follow my lord .
I pray thee , forgiue the trespasse of thine handmaide : for the Lord will certainely make my lord a sure house , because my lord fighteth the battels of the Lord , and euill hath not bene found in thee all thy dayes .
Yet a man is risen to pursue thee , and to seeke thy soule : but the soule of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God , and the soules of thine enemies , them shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
And it shall come to passe when the Lord shal haue done to my lord , according to all the good that hee hath spoken concerning thee , and shall haue appointed thee ruler ouer Israel ;
That this shall bee no griefe vnto thee , nor offence of heart vnto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causelesse , or that my lord hath auenged himselfe : But when the Lord shall haue dealt well with my lord , then remember thine handmayd .
¶ And Dauid sayd to Abigail , Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which sent thee this day to meet me .
And blessed bee thy aduice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from comming to shed blood , and from auenging my selfe with mine owne hand .
For in very deed , as the Lord God of Israel liueth , which hath kept mee backe from hurting thee , except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me , surely there had not bene left vnto Nabal , by the morning light , any that pisseth against the wall .
So Dauid receiued of her hand that which shee had brought him , and sayd vnto her , Goe vp in peace to thine house ; See , I haue hearkened to thy voyce , and haue accepted thy person .
¶ And Abigail came to Nabal , and behold , he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king ; & Nabals heart was merry within him , for hee was very drunken : wherefore shee tolde him nothing , lesse or more , vntill the morning light .
But it came to passe in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
And it came to passe about ten dayes after , that the Lord smote Nabal , that he died .
¶ And when Dauid heard that Nabal was dead , he said , Blessed be the Lord , that hath pleaded the cause of my reproch from the hand of Nabal , and hath kept his seruant from euil : for the Lord hath returned the wickednesse of Nabal vpon his owne head . And Dauid sent , and communed with Abigail , to take her to him to wife .
And when the seruants of Dauid were come to Abigail to Carmel , they spake vnto her , saying , Dauid sent vs vnto thee , to take thee to him to wife .
And shee arose , and bowed her selfe on her face to the earth , and sayd , Beholde , let thine handmayd bee a seruant to wash the feet of the seruants of my lord .
And Abigail hasted , and rose , and rode vpon an asse , with fiue damosels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of Dauid , and became his wife .
Dauid also tooke Ahinoam of Iezreel , and they were also both of them his wiues .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Ziphites came vnto Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doeth not Dauid hide himselfe in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Ieshimon ?
Then Saul arose , and went downe to the wildernesse of Ziph , hauing three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seeke Dauid in the wildernesse of Ziph .
And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Ieshimon by the way : but Dauid abode in the wildernesse , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wildernesse .
Dauid therefore sent out spies , and vnderstood that Saul was come in very deed .
¶ And Dauid arose , and came to the place where Saul had pitched : and Dauid beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the sonne of Ner the captaine of his hoste : and Saul lay in the trench , and the people pitched round about him .
Then answered Dauid , and sayd to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah brother to Ioab , saying , Who will goe downe with me to Saul to the campe ? And Abishai sayd , I will goe downe with thee .
So Dauid and Abishai came to the people by night , and behold , Saul lay sleeping within the trench , and his speare stucke in the ground at his bolster : but Abner and the people lay round about him .
Then said Abishai to Dauid , God hath deliuered thine enemie into thine hand this day : now therefore let mee smite him , I pray thee , with the speare , euen to the earth at once , and I will not smite him the second time .
And Dauid sayd to Abishai , Destroy him not : for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lords Anointed , and be guiltlesse ?
Dauid said furthermore , As the Lord liueth , the Lord shal smite him , or his day shall come to die , or hee shall descend into battell , and perish .
The Lord forbid that I should stretch foorth mine hand against the Lords Anointed : but I pray thee , take thou now the speare that is at his bolster , and the cruse of water , and let vs goe .
So Dauid tooke the speare and the cruse of water from Sauls bolster , and they gate them away , and no man saw it , nor knew it , neither awaked : for they were all asleepe , because a deepe sleepe from the Lord was fallen vpon them .
¶ Then Dauid went ouer to the other side , and stood on the toppe of an hill afarre off ( a great space being betweene them : )
And Dauid cryed to the people , and to Abner the sonne of Ner , saying , Answerest thou not , Abner ? Then Abner answered , and sayd , Who art thou that cryest to the King ?
And Dauid said to Abner , Art not thou a valiant man ? and who is like to thee in Israel ? Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king ? for there came one of the people in , to destroy the king thy lord .
This thing is not good that thou hast done : as the Lord liueth , ye are worthy to die , because yee haue not kept your master the Lords Anointed : and now see where the Kings speare is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster .
And Saul knew Dauids voyce , and said , Is this thy voice , my sonne Dauid ? And Dauid saide , It is my voice , my lord , O king .
And he said , Wherefore doeth my lord thus pursue after his seruant ? for what haue I done ? or what euill is in mine hand ?
Now therefore , I pray thee , let my lord the king heare the words of his seruant : If the Lord haue stirred thee vp against mee , let him accept an offering : but if they be the children of men , cursed be they before the Lord : for they haue driuen me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord , saying , Goe serue other gods .
Now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seeke a flea , as when one doeth hunt a partridge in the mountaines .
¶ Then said Saul , I haue sinned : Returne , my sonne Dauid , for I will no more doe thee harme , because my soule was precious in thine eyes this day : behold , I haue played the foole , and haue erred exceedingly .
And Dauid answered , and sayd , Behold the kings speare , and let one of the yong men come ouer and fetch it .
The Lord render to euery man his righteousnesse , and his faithfulnesse : for the Lord deliuered thee into my hand to day , but I would not stretch foorth mine hand against the Lords Anointed .
And behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes : so let my life bee much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliuer me out of all tribulation .
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid sayd in his heart , I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul : there is nothing better for me , then that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines ; and Saul shal despaire of me , to seeke me any more in any coast of Israel : so shall I escape out of his hand .
And Dauid arose , and hee passed ouer with the sixe hundred men that were with him , vnto Achish the sonne of Maoch king of Gath .
And Dauid dwelt with Achish at Gath , he , and his men , euery man with his houshold , euen Dauid with his two wiues , Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse , and Abigail the Carmelitesse Nabals wife .
And it was told Saul , that Dauid was fled to Gath , and he sought no more againe for him .
¶ And Dauid said vnto Achish , If I haue now found grace in thine eyes , let them giue mee a place in some towne in the countrey , that I may dwel there : for why should thy seruant dwell in the royall citie with thee ?
Then Achish gaue him Ziklag that day : wherfore Ziklag pertaineth vnto the kings of Iudah vnto this day .
And the time that Dauid dwelt in the countrey of the Philistines , was a full yeere , and foure moneths .
¶ And Dauid and his men went vp and inuaded the Geshurites , and the Gezrites , and the Amalekites : for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land , as thou goest to Shur , euen vnto the land of Egypt .
And Dauid smote the land , and left neither man nor woman aliue , and tooke away the sheepe , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparell , and returned , and came to Achish .
And Achish said , Whither haue ye made a rode to day ? And Dauid said , Against the South of Iudah , and against the South of the Ierahmeelites , and against the South of the Kenites .
And Dauid saued neither man nor woman aliue , to bring tidings to Gath , saying , Lest they should tell on vs , saying , So did Dauid , and so will be his maner , all the while he dwelleth in the countrey of the Philistines .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe in those dayes , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel : And Achish said vnto Dauid , Knowe thou assuredly , that thou shalt goe out with me to battell , thou , and thy men .
And Dauid said to Achish , Surely thou shalt know what thy seruant can doe . And Achish said to Dauid , Therfore will I make thee keeper of mine head for euer .
¶ Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , euen in his owne citie : and Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wyzards , out of the land .
And the Philistines gathered themselues together , and came and pitched in Shunem : and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they pitched in Gilboa .
And when Saul saw the hoste of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly trembled .
And when Saul enquired of the Lord , the Lord answered him not , neither by dreames , nor by Urim , nor by Prophets .
¶ Then said Saul vnto his seruants , Seeke me a woman that hath a familiar spirit , that I may goe to her , and enquire of her . And his seruant said to him , Beholde , there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor .
And Saul disguised himselfe , and put on other raiment , and hee went , and two men with him , and they came to the woman by night , and he said , I pray thee diuine vnto me by the familiar spirit , and bring me him vp whom I shall name vnto thee .
And the woman saide vnto him , Beholde , thou knowest what Saul hath done , how hee hath cut off those that haue familiar spirits , and the wyzards out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ?
And Saul sware to her by the Lord , saying , As the Lord liueth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
Then said the woman , Whome shall I bring vp vnto thee ? and he said , Bring me vp Samuel .
And when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a lowd voyce ; and the woman spake to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceiued me ? for thou art Saul .
And the king sayd vnto her , Be not afraid : for what sawest thou ? And the woman said vnto Saul , I saw gods ascending out of the earth .
And he said vnto her , What forme is he of ? And she said , An old man commeth vp , and he is couered with a mantle . And Saul perceiued that it was Samuel , and hee stouped with his face to the ground , and bowed himselfe .
¶ And Samuel said to Saul , Why hast thou disquieted me , to bring me vp ? And Saul answered , I am sore distressed ; for the Philistins make war against me , and God is departed from me , and answereth me no more , neither by Prophets , nor by dreames : therefore I haue called thee , that thou mayst make knowen vnto me , what I shall doe .
Then said Samuel , Wherefore then doest thou aske of mee , seeing the Lord is departed from thee , and is become thine enemy ?
And the Lord hath done to him , as hee spake by mee : for the Lord hath rent the kingdome out of thine hand , and giuen it to thy neighbour , euen to Dauid :
Because thou obeiedst not the voice of the Lord , nor executedst his fierce wrath vpon Amalek , therefore hath the Lord done this thing vnto thee this day .
Moreouer , the Lord will also deliuer Israel with thee , into the hand of the Philistines : and to morrow shalt thou and thy sonnes bee with mee : the Lord also shall deliuer the hoste of Israel into the hand of the Philistines .
Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth , and was sore afraid , because of the words of Samuel , & there was no strength in him : for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor al the night .
¶ And the woman came vnto Saul , and saw that he was sore troubled , and sayd vnto him , Behold , thine handmayd hath obeyed thy voice , and I haue put my life in my hand , and haue hearkened vnto thy words which thou spakest vnto me :
Now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also vnto the voyce of thine handmaid , & let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; & eat , that thou mayest haue strength , when thou goest on thy way .
But hee refused , and said , I will not eate . But his seruants together with the woman compelled him , and he hearkened vnto their voyce : so he arose from the earth , & sate vpon the bed .
And the woman had a fat calfe in the house , and she hasted , and killed it , and tooke flower and kneaded it , and did bake vnleauened bread thereof .

Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek : and the Israelites pitched by a fountaine which is in Iezreel .
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands : but Dauid and his men passed on in the rere - ward with Achish .
Then said the princes of the Philistines , What doe these Hebrewes here ? And Achish said vnto the princes of the Philistines , Is not this Dauid the seruant of Saul the king of Israel , which hath bene with me these dayes , or these yeeres , and I haue found no fault in him since he fell vnto me , vnto this day ?
And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him , and the princes of the Philistines said vnto him , Make this fellow returne , that he may goe againe to his place which thou hast appointed him , and let him not go downe with vs to battel , lest in the battell he be an aduersary to vs : for wherewith should hee reconcile himselfe vnto his master ? should it not be with the heads of these men ?
Is not this Dauid , of whom they sang one to another in daunces , saying , Saul slew his thousands , and Dauid his ten thousands ?
¶ Then Achish called Dauid , and said vnto him , Surely , as the Lord liueth , thou hast bene vpright , and thy going out and thy comming in with me in the hoste is good in my sight : for I haue not found euil in thee , since the day of thy comming vnto me vnto this day : neuertheles , the lords fauour thee not .
Wherefore now returne and goe in peace , that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines .
¶ And Dauid said vnto Achish , But what haue I done ? and what hast thou found in thy seruant so long as I haue bene with thee vnto this day , that I may not goe fight against the enemies of my lord the king ?
And Achish answered , and said to Dauid , I know that thou art good in my sight , as an Angel of God : notwithstanding the Princes of the Philistines haue said , Hee shall not goe vp with vs to the battell .
Wherfore now rise vp early in the morning , with thy masters seruants that are come with thee : and assoone as yee be vp early in the morning , and haue light , depart .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when Dauid and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had inuaded the South and Ziklag , and smitten Ziklag , and burnt it with fire :
And had taken the women captiues , that were therein ; they slewe not any either great or smal , but caried them away , and went on their way .
¶ So Dauid and his men came to the citie , and beholde , it was burnt with fire , and their wiues , and their sonnes , and their daughters were taken captiues .
Then Dauid and the people that were with him , lift vp their voice , and wept , vntill they had no more power to weepe .
And Dauids two wiues were taken captiues , Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
And Dauid was greatly distressed : for the people spake of stoning him , because the soule of all the people was grieued , euery man for his sonnes , and for his daughters : but Dauid encouraged himselfe in the Lord his God .
And Dauid said to Abiathar the Priest Ahimelechs sonne , I pray thee , bring mee hither the Ephod : and Abiathar brought thither the Ephod to Dauid .
And Dauid enquired at the Lord , saying ; Shall I pursue after this troupe ? shall I ouertake them ? And he answered him , Pursue , for thou shalt surely ouertake them , and without faile recouer all .
So Dauid went , hee , and the sixe hundred men that were with him , and came to the brooke Besor , where those that were left behinde , stayed .
But Dauid pursued , he and foure hundred men : ( for two hundred abode behinde , which were so faint that they could not goe ouer the brooke Besor . )
¶ And they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to Dauid , and gaue him bread , and he did eate , and they made him drinke water .
And they gaue him a piece of a cake of figges , and two clusters of raisins : and when hee had eaten , his spirit came againe to him : for hee had eaten no bread , nor drunke any water , three dayes and three nights .
And Dauid sayde vnto him , To whome belongest thou ? and whence art thou ? And he said , I am a yong man of Egypt , seruant to an Amalekite , and my master left me , because three dayes agone I fell sicke .
Wee made an inuasion vpon the South of the Cherethites , and vpon the coast which belongeth to Iudah , and vpon the South of Caleb , and wee burnt Ziklag with fire .
And Dauid sayde to him , Canst thou bring me downe to this company ? And he said , Sweare vnto me by God , that thou wilt neither kill me , nor deliuer mee into the handes of my master , and I will bring thee downe to this company .
¶ And when he had brought him downe , behold , they were spread abroad vpon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dauncing , because of all the great spoile that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines , and out of the land of Iudah .
And Dauid smote them from the twilight , euen vnto the euening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , saue foure hundred yong men which rode vpon camels , and fled .
And Dauid recouered all that the Amalekites had caried away : and Dauid rescued his two wiues .
And there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sonnes nor daughters , neither spoile , nor any thing that they had taken to them : Dauid recouered all .
And Dauid tooke all the flockes , and the herds , which they draue before those other cattell , and said , This is Dauids spoile .
¶ And Dauid came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow Dauid , whome they had made also to abide at the brook Besor : and they went forth to meet Dauid , and to meete the people , that were with him ; and when Dauid came neere to the people , he saluted them .
Then answered all the wicked men , and men of Belial , of those that went with Dauid , and said , Because they went not with vs , we wil not giue them ought of the spoile , that wee haue recouered , saue to euery man his wife and his children , that they may leade them away , and depart .
Then said Dauid , Ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the Lord hath giuen vs , who hath preserued vs , and deliuered the companie that came against vs , into our hand .
For who will hearken vnto you in this matter ? But as his part is that goeth downe to the battell , so shall his part bee that tarieth by the stuffe : they shall part alike .
And to them which were in Rachal , and them which were in the cities of the Ierahmeelites , and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites , And to them which were in Hormah , and to them which were in Chorashan , and to them which were in Athach ,

Nowe the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell downe slaine in mount Gilboa .
And the Philistines followed hard vpon Saul , and vpon his sonnes , and the Philistines slewe Ionathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , Sauls sonnes .
And the battell went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him , and he was sore wounded of the archers .
Then said Saul vnto his armour bearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith , lest these vncircumcised come and thrust me through , and abuse mee . But his armour bearer would not , for he was sore afraid : therfore Saul tooke a sword , & fell vpon it .
And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise vpon his sword , and died with him .
So Saul died , and his three sons , and his armour bearer , and all his men that same day together .
¶ And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley , and they that were on the other side Iordane , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sonnes were dead , they forsooke the cities and fled , and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
And it came to passe on the morrow when the Philistines came to strip the slaine , that they found Saul , and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
And they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idoles , and among the people .
And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth : and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan .
¶ And when the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul :
All the valiant men arose , and went all night , and tooke the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sonnes from the wall of Bethshan , and came to Iabesh , and burnt them there .

Paul and Siluanus , and Timotheus , vnto the Church of the Thessalonians , which is in God the Father , and in the Lord Iesus Christ : grace be vnto you , and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Iesus Christ .
We giue thankes to God alwaies for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ,
Remembring without ceasing your worke of faith , and labour of loue , and patience of hope in our Lord Iesus Christ , in the sight of God and our Father :
Knowing , brethren beloued , your election of God .
For our Gospel came not vnto you in word onely : but also in power , and in the holy Ghost , and in much assurance , as yee know what maner of men we were among you for your sake .
And yee became followers of vs , and of the Lord , hauing receiued the word in much affliction , with ioy of the holy Ghost :
So that ye were ensamples to all that beleeue in Macedonia and Achaia .
For from you sounded out the Word of the Lord , not onely in Macedonia & Achaia , but also in euery place your faith to Godward is spred abroad , so that we need not to speak any thing .
For they themselues shew of vs , what maner of entring in we had vnto you , and how yee turned to God from idols , to serue the liuing , and true God ,
<NON-VERSE>
For your selues , brethren , knowe our entrance in vnto you , that it was not in vaine .
But euen after that wee had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , wee were bold in our God , to speake vnto you the Gospel of God with much contention .
For our exhortation was not of deceite , nor of vncleannesse , nor in guile :
But as we were allowed of God to bee put in trust with the Gospel , euen so wee speake , not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
But wee were gentle among you , euen as a nurse cherisheth her children :
So being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to haue imparted vnto you , not the Gospel of God only , but also our owne soules , because ye were deare vnto vs .
As you know , how wee exhorted and comforted , and charged euery one of you , ( as a father doeth his children , )
That ye would walke worthy of God , who hath called you vnto his kingdome and glory .
For this cause also thanke wee God without ceasing , because when yee receiued the word of God , which yee heard of vs , yee receiued it not as the word of men , but ( as it is in trueth ) the word of God , which effectually worketh also in you that beleeue .
For yee , brethren , became followers of the Churches of God , which in Iudea are in Christ Iesus : for ye also haue suffered like things of your owne countreymen , euen as they haue of the Iewes :
Who both killed the Lord Iesus , and their owne Prophets , and haue persecuted vs : and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
Forbidding vs to speake to the Gentiles , that they might bee saued , to fill vp their sinnes alway : for the wrath is come vpon them to the vttermost .
But wee , brethren , beeing taken from you for a short time , in presence , not in heart , endeuored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
Wherefore we would haue come vnto you ( euen I Paul ) once & againe : but Satan hindered vs .
For what is our hope , or ioy , or crowne of reioycing ? Are not euen ye in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ at his comming ?
<NON-VERSE> Wherefore when wee could no longer forbeare , wee thought it good to bee left at Athens alone :
And sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God , and our fellow labourer in the Gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
That no man should be mooued by these afflictions : for your selues know that we are appointed therunto .
For verily when wee were with you , we told you before , that we should suffer tribulation , euen as it came to passe and ye know .
For this cause when I could no longer forbeare , I sent to know your faith , lest by some meanes the tempter haue tempted you , and our labor be in vaine .
But now when Timotheus came from you vnto vs , and brought vs good tidings of your faith and charitie , and that ye haue good remembrance of vs alwayes , desiring greatly to see vs , as we also to see you :
Therefore brethren , wee were comforted ouer you in all our affliction and distresse , by your faith :
For now we liue , if ye stand fast in the Lord .
For what thankes can we render to God againe for you , for all the ioy wherewith wee ioy for your sakes before our God ,
Night & day praying exceedingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
Now God himselfe and our Father , and our Lord Iesus Christ direct our way vnto you .
And the Lorde make you to increase , & abound in loue one towards another , and towards all men , euen as we doe towards you :
<NON-VERSE>
Furthermore then we beseech you , brethren , and exhort you by the Lord Iesus , that as yee haue receiued of vs , how ye ought to walke , and to please God , so yee would abound more and more .
For yee know what commandements wee gaue you , by the Lord Iesus .
For this is the will of God , euen your sanctification , that yee should absteine from fornication :
That no man goe beyond and defraud his brother in any matter , because that the Lord is the auenger of all such ; as we also haue forewarned you , and testified :
For God hath not called vs vnto vncleannesse , but vnto holinesse .
He therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but God , who hath also giuen vnto vs his holy Spirit .
But as touching brotherly loue , ye need not that I write vnto you : for yee your selues are taught of God to loue one an other .
And in deed ye doe it towards all the brethren , which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more :
But I would not haue you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleepe , that ye sorrow not , euen as others which haue no hope .
For the Lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with a shout , with the voyce of the Archangel , and with the trumpe of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first .
Then we which are aliue , and remaine , shalbe caught vp together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the aire : and so shall wee euer bee with the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
But of the times and the seasons , brethren , yee haue no need that I write vnto you .
For your selues knowe perfectly that the day of the Lord so commeth as a thiefe in the night .
For when they shal say , Peace and safety : then sudden destruction commeth vpon them , as trauaile vpon a woman with childe , and they shall not escape .
But ye , brethren , are not in darkenesse , that that day should ouertake you as a thiefe .
Yee are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkenesse .
Therefore let vs not sleepe , as doe others : but let vs watch and be sober .
For they that sleepe , sleepe in the night , and they that bee drunken , are drunken in the night .
But let vs who are of the day , bee sober , putting on the brestplate of faith and loue , and for an helmet , the hope of saluation .
For God hath not appointed vs to wrath : but to obtaine saluation by our Lord Iesus Christ ,
Who died for vs , that whether we wake or sleepe , we should liue together with him .
Wherefore , comfort your selues together , and edifie one another , euen as also ye doe .
And we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are ouer you in the Lord , and admonish you :
And to esteeme them very highly in loue for their workes sake , and be at peace among your selues .
Now we exhort you , brethren , warne them that are vnruly , comfort the feeble minded , support the weake , be patient toward all men .
See that none render euill for euill vnto any man : but euer follow that which is good , both among your selues and to all men . Reioyce euermore :
Pray without ceasing :
In euery thing giue thankes : for this is the will of God in Christ Iesus concerning you . Quench not the spirit :
Abstaine from all appearance of euill .
And the very God of peace sanctifie you wholly : and I pray God your whole spirit , and soule , and body be preserued blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ .
Faithfull is hee that calleth you , who also will doe it . Brethren , pray for vs .
Greete all the brethren with an holy kisse .
I charge you by the Lord , that this Epistle bee read vnto all the holy brethren .

Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the commaundement of God our Sauiour , & Lord Iesus Christ which is our hope ,
Unto Timothie my own sonne in the Faith : Grace , mercie , and peace from God our Father , and Iesus Christ our Lord .
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
Neither giue heed to fables , and endlesse genealogies , which minister questions , rather then edifying which is in faith : so doe .
Now the end of the commandement is charity , out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith vnfained .
From which some hauing swarued , haue turned aside vnto vaine iangling ,
Desiring to bee teachers of the Law , vnderstanding neither what they say , nor whereof they affirme .
But we know that the Law is good , if a man vse it lawfully .
Knowing this , that the Law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawlesse and disobedient , for the vngodly , and for sinners , for vnholy , and profane , for murderers of fathers , and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
For whoremongers , for them that defile themselues with mankinde , for men - stealers , for liars , for periured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ,
According to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
And I thanke Christ Iesus our Lord , who hath enabled mee : for that he counted me faithfull , putting me into the Ministerie ,
Who was before a blasphemer , and a persecuter , and iniurious . But I obtained mercie , because I did it ignorantly , in vnbeliefe .
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant , with faith , & loue , which is in Christ Iesus .
This is a faithfull saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Iesus came into the world to saue sinners , of whom I am chiefe .
Howbeit , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first , Iesus Christ might shew foorth all long suffering , for a paterne to them which should hereafter beleeue on him to life euerlasting .
Now vnto the king eternal , immortall , inuisible , the onely wise God , be honour and glory for euer & euer . Amen .
This charge I commit vnto thee , sonne Timothie , according to the prophesies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest warre a good warfare ,
Holding faith , and a good conscience , which some hauing put away , concerning faith , haue made shipwracke .
<NON-VERSE>
I exhort therefore , that first of all , supplications , prayers , intercessions , and giuing of thanks be made for all men :
For Kings , and for all that are in authoritie , that we may leade a quiet and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honestie .
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sauiour ,
Who will haue all men to bee saued , and to come vnto the knowledge of the trueth .
For there is one God , and one Mediatour betweene God and men , the man Christ Iesus ,
Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all , to be testified in due time .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an Apostle ( I speake the trueth in Christ , and lie not ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and veritie .
I will therefore that men pray euery where , lifting vp holy handes without wrath , and doubting .
In like maner also , that women adorne themselues in modest apparell , with shamefastnesse and sobrietie , not with broided haire , or gold , or pearles , or costly aray ,
But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man , but to be in silence .
For Adam was first formed , then Eue :
And Adam was not deceiued , but the woman being deceiued was in the transgression :
<NON-VERSE>
This is a true saying : If a man desire the office of a Bishop , he desireth a good worke .
A Bishop then must be blamelesse , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behauiour , giuen to hospitalitie , apt to teach ;
Not giuen to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre , but patient , not a brawler , not couetous ;
One that ruleth well his owne house , hauing his children in subiection with all grauitie .
Moreouer , hee must haue a good report of them which are without , lest he fall into reproch , and the snare of the deuill .
Likewise must the Deacons bee graue , not double tongued , not giuen to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ,
Holding the mysterie of the faith in a pure conscience .
And let these also first be proued ; then let them vse the office of a Deacon , being found blamelesse .
Euen so must their wiues be graue ; not slanderers , sober , faithfull in all things .
Let the Deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children , and their owne houses well .
For they that haue vsed the office of a Deacon well , purchase to themselues a good degree , and great boldnesse in the faith , which is in Christ Iesus .
These things write I vnto thee , hoping to come vnto thee shortly .
But if I tary long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behaue thy selfe in the House of God , which is the Church of the liuing God , the pillar and ground of the trueth .
<NON-VERSE>
Now the Spirit speaketh expresly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giuing heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of deuils :
Speaking lies in hypocrisie , hauing their conscience seared with a hote iron ,
Forbidding to marry , and commanding to absteine from meates , which God hath created to bee receiued with thankesgiuing of them which beleeue , and know the trueth .
For euery creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be receiued with thankesgiuing :
For it is sanctified by the word of God , and prayer .
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Iesus Christ , nourished vp in the wordes of faith , and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
But refuse prophane and olde wiues fables , and exercise thy selfe rather vnto godlinesse .
For bodily exercise profiteth litle , but godlinesse is profitable vnto all things , hauing promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation :
For therfore we both labour , and suffer reproch , because we trust in the liuing God , who is the Sauiour of all men , specially of those that beleeue .
These things command & teach .
Let no man despise thy youth , but be thou an example of the beleeuers , in word , in conuersation , in charitie , in spirit , in faith , in puritie .
Till I come , giue attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was giuen thee by prophesie , with the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie .
Meditate vpon these things , giue thy selfe wholly to them , that thy profiting may appeare to all .
<NON-VERSE>
Rebuke not an Elder , but intreate him as a father , and the yonger men as brethren :
The elder women as mothers , the yonger as sisters with all puritie .
Honour widowes that are widowes indeed .
But if any widow haue children or nephewes , let them learne first to shew pietie at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God .
Now she that is a widow in deed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
But she that liueth in pleasure , is dead while she liueth .
And these things giue in charge , that they may be blamelesse .
But if any prouide not for his owne , & specially for those of his owne house , hee hath denied the faith , and is worse then an infidel .
Let not a widow bee taken into the number , vnder threescore yeeres old , hauing bene the wife of one man ,
Well reported of for good works , if shee haue brought vp children , if shee haue lodged strangers , if she haue washed the Saints feet , if shee haue releeued the afflicted , if shee haue diligently followed euery good worke .
But the yonger widowes refuse : for when they haue begunne to waxe wanton against Christ , they will marry ,
Hauing damnation , because they haue cast off their first faith .
And withall they learne to bee idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not onely idle , but tatlers also , and busibodies , speaking things which they ought not .
I will therefore that the yonger women marry , beare children , guid the house , giue none occasion to the aduersary to speake reprochfully .
For some are already turned aside after Satan .
If any man or woman that beleeueth haue widowes , let them relieue them , and let not the Church be charged , that it may relieue them that are widowes indeed .
Let the Elders that rule well , be counted worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and doctrine .
For the Scripture saith , Thou shalt not mousell the oxe that treadeth out the corne : and , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
Against an Elder receiue not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
Them that sinne rebuke before all , that others also may feare .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Iesus Christ , and the elect Angels , that thou obserue these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partialitie .
Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither bee partaker of other mens sinnes . Keepe thy selfe pure .
Drinke no longer water , but vse a little wine for thy stomackes sake , and thine often infirmities .
Some mens sinnes are open before hand , going before to iudgement : and some men they follow after .
<NON-VERSE> Let as many seruants as are vnder the yoke , count their owne masters worthy of all honour , that the Name of God , and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
And they that haue beleeuing masters , let them not despise them because they are brethren : but rather doe them seruice , because they are faithfull and beloued , partakers of the benefite : These things teach and exhort .
If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , euen the wordes of our Lord Iesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godlinesse :
Hee is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions , and strifes of wordes , whereof commeth enuie , strife , railings , euill surmisings ,
Peruerse disputings of men of corrupt mindes , and destitute of the trueth , supposing that gaine is godlinesse : From such withdraw thy selfe .
But godlinesse with contentment is great gaine .
For we brought nothing into this world , and it is certaine we can cary nothing out .
And hauing food and raiment let vs be therewith content .
But they that will be rich , fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish & hurtfull lusts , which drowne men in destruction and perdition .
For the loue of money is the root of all euill , which while some coueted after , they haue erred from the faith , and pierced themselues through with many sorrowes .
But thou , O man of God , flie these things ; and follow after righteousnesse , godlinesse , faith , loue , patience , meekenesse .
Fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternall life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
I giue thee charge in the sight of God , who quickneth all things , and before Christ Iesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good Confession ,
That thou keepe this commandement without spot , vnrebukeable , vntill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ .
Which in his times he shall shew , who is the blessed , and onely Potentate , the King of kings , and Lord of lords :
Who onely hath immortalitie , dwelling in the light , which no man can approch vnto , whom no man hath seene , nor can see : to whom be honour and power euerlasting . Amen .
Charge them that are rich in this world , that they bee not high minded , nor trust in vncertaine riches , but in the liuing God , who giueth vs richly all things to enioy ,
That they doe good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ,
Laying vp in store for themselues a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay holde on eternall life .
O Timothie , keepe that which is committed to thy trust , auoyding prophane and vaine bablings , and oppositions of science , fasly so called :

And Solomon the sonne of Dauid was strengthned in his kingdome , and the Lord his God was with him , & magnified him exceedingly .
Then Solomon spake vnto all Israel , to the captaines of thousands , and of hundreds , and to the Iudges , and to euery gouernour in all Israel , the chiefe of the fathers .
So Solomon and all the Congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon , for there was the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God , which Moses the seruant of the Lord had made in the wildernesse .
But the Arke of God had Dauid brought vp from Kiriath - iearim , to the place which Dauid had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Ierusalem .
Moreouer the brasen Altar that Bezaleel the sonne of Uri , the sonne of Hur , had made , hee put before the Tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Congregation sought vnto it .
And Solomon went vp thither to the brasen Altar before the Lord , which was at the Tabernacle of the Congregation , and offered a thousand burnt offerings vpon it .
¶ In that night did God appeare vnto Solomon , and saide vnto him ; Aske what I shall giue thee .
And Solomon saide vnto God , Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father , and hast made me to reigne in his stead :
Now , O Lord God , let thy promise vnto Dauid my father be established : for thou hast made mee King ouer a people , like the dust of the earth in multitude .
Giue mee now wisedome and knowledge , that I may goe out and come in before this people . For who can iudge this thy people , that is so great ?
And God said to Solomon , Because this was in thine heart , and thou hast not asked riches , wealth , or honour , nor the life of thine enemies , neither yet hast asked long life ; but hast asked wisedome and knowledge for thy selfe , that thou mayest iudge my people , ouer whom I haue made thee King :
Wisedome and knowledge is granted vnto thee , and I will giue thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings haue had , that haue beene before thee , neither shall there any after thee haue the like .
¶ Then Solomon came from his iourney to the high place that was at Gibeon , to Ierusalem , from before the Tabernacle of the Congregation , and reigned ouer Israel .
And Solomon gathered charets and horsemen : and hee had a thousand and foure hundred charets , and twelue thousand horsemen , which he placed in the charet - cities , and with the King at Ierusalem .

And Solomon determined to build an house for the Name of the Lord , and an house for his kingdome .
And Solomon told out threescore and tenne thousand men to beare burdens , and fourescore thousand to hewe in the mountaine , and three thousand and sixe hundred to ouersee them .
¶ And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre , saying , As thou diddest deale with Dauid my father , and diddest send him Cedars to builde him an house to dwell therein , euen so deale with me .
Behold , I build an house to the name of the Lord my God , to dedicate it to him , and to burne before him sweet incense , and for the continuall shew - bread , and for the burnt offrings morning and euening , on the Sabbaths , and on the new Moones , and on the solemne feasts of the Lord our God . This is an ordinance for euer to Israel .
And the house which I build , is great : for great is our God aboue all gods .
But who is able to build him an house , seeing the heauen , and heauen of heauens cannot conteine him ? who am I then that I should build him an house ? saue onely to burne sacrifice before him ?
Send me now therefore a man , cunning to worke in gold and in siluer , and in brasse , and in yron , and in purple and crimson , and blew , and that can skil to graue , with the cunning men that are with me in Iudah , and in Ierusalem , whome Dauid my father did prouide .
Send me also Cedar trees , firre trees , and Algume trees , out of Lebanon : ( for I know that thy seruants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon ) and behold , my seruants shalbe with thy seruants ,
Euen to prepare me timber in abundance : for the house which I am about to build , shalbe wonderfull great .
And behold , I will giue to thy seruants the hewers that cut timber , twentie thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twentie thousand measures of barley , and twentie thousand baths of wine , and twentie thousand baths of oyle .
¶ Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which hee sent to Solomon : Because the Lord hath loued his people , hee hath made thee King ouer them .
Huram said moreouer , Blessed be the Lord God of Israel that made heauen and earth , who hath giuen to Dauid the King a wise sonne , indued with prudence and vnderstanding , that might build an house for the Lord , and an house for his kingdome .
And now I haue sent a cunning man ( indued with vnderstanding ) of Huram my fathers :
The sonne of a woman of the daughters of Dan , and his father was a man of Tyre , skilfull to worke in golde and in siluer , in brasse , in yron , in stone and in timber , in purple , in blew , and in fine linen , and in crimson : also to graue any maner of grauing , and to find out euery deuice which shall be put to him , with thy cunning men , and with the cunning men of my lord Dauid thy father .
Now therefore the wheate and the barley , the oyle and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send vnto his seruants :
And wee will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need , and wee will bring it to thee in flotes by sea to Ioppa , and thou shalt carie it vp to Ierusalem .
¶ And Solomon numbred all the strangers that were in the lande of Israel , after the numbring wherewith Dauid his father had numbred them : and they were found an hundred and fiftie thousand , and three thousand and sixe hundred .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Ierusalem in Mount Moriah , where the Lord appeared vnto Dauid his father , in the place that Dauid had prepared in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite .
And he began to build in the second day of the second moneth , in the fourth yeere of his reigne .
¶ Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . The length by cubites after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twentie cubites .
And the porch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was atcording to the breadth of the house , twentie cubites , and the height was an hundred and twenty : and he ouerlaid it within , with pure gold .
And the greater house hee sieled with firre tree , which he ouerlaid with fine gold , and set thereon palme trees and chaines .
And he garnished the house with precious stones for beautie , and the gold was gold of Paruaim .
Hee ouerlaid also the house , the beames , the postes and the wals thereof , and the doores thereof with gold , and graued Cherubims on the walles .
And he made the most holy house , the length whereof was , according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twentie cubits : and he ouerlaid it with fine gold amounting to sixe hundred talents .
And the weight of the nailes was fiftie shekels of gold : and he ouerlaide the vpper chambers with gold .
And in the most holy place hee made two Cherubims of image work , and ouerlaid them with gold . ¶ And the wings of the Cherubims were twentie cubites long : one wing of the one Cherub was fiue cubites , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise fiue cubites , reaching to the wing of the other Cherub :
And one wing of the other Cherub was fiue cubites , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was fiue cubites also , ioyning to the wing of the other Cherub .
The wings of these Cherubims spread themselues forth twentie cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
¶ And he made the vaile of blue and purple , and crimson , and fine linen , and wrought Cherubims thereon .
Also hee made before the house , two pillars of thirtie and fiue cubites high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them , was fiue cubites . And he made chaines , as in the Oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars , and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chaines .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer he made an Altar of brasse , twentie cubites the length thereof , and twentie cubites the breadth thereof , and ten cubites the height therof .
¶ Also he made a molten Sea of ten cubites , from brim to brim , round in compasse , and fiue cubites the height thereof , and a line of thirtie cubites did compasse it round about .
And vnder it was the similitude of oxen , which did compasse it round about : tenne in a cubite compassing the Sea round about . Two rowes of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
It stood vpon twelue oxen : three looking toward the North , and three looking toward the West , and three looking toward the South , and three looking toward the East : and the Sea was set aboue vpon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
And the thicknes of it was an hand breadth , & the brim of it like the worke of the brim of a cup , with flowers of Lillies : and it receiued and held three thousand baths .
He made also ten tables , and placed them in the Temple , fiue on the right side , and fiue on the left : and hee made an hundred basens of gold .
¶ Furthermore , hee made the court of the Priests , and the great court , and doores for the court , and ouerlayd the doores of them with brasse .
And he set the Sea on the rightside of the East end , ouer against the South .
And foure hundred Pomegranats on the two wreathes : two rowes of Pomegranats on each wreath , to couer the two pommels of the chapiters , which were vpon the pillars . He made also bases ; and lauers made he vpon the bases .
One Sea , & twelue oxen vnder it .
The pots also , and the shouels , and the fleshhookes , and all their instruments , did Huram his father make to King Solomon for the house of the Lord , of bright brasse .
In the plaine of Iordan did the King cast them , in the clay - ground , betweene Succoth and Zeredathah .
Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance : for the weight of the brasse could not be found out .
And the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs made he of golde , and that perfect gold .
<NON-VERSE>
Thus al the worke that Solomon made for the house of the Lord , was finished : & Solomon brought in all the things that Dauid his father had dedicated ; and the siluer , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
¶ Then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel , and all the heads of the Tribes , the chiefe of the fathers of the children of Israel vnto Ierusalem , to bring vp the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , out of the citie of Dauid , which is Zion .
Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselues vnto the king in the feast , which was in the seuenth moneth .
And all the Elders of Israel came , and the Leuites tooke vp the Arke .
And they brought vp the Arke , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , these did the Priests and the Leuites bring vp .
Also king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled vnto him before the Arke , sacrificed sheepe and oxen , which could not be told nor numbred for multitude .
And the priests brought in the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord vnto his place , to the Oracle of the house , into the most holy place , euen vnder the wings of the Cherubims :
For the Cherubims spread foorth their wings ouer the place of the Arke , and the Cherubims couered the Arke and the staues thereof , aboue .
And they drew out the staues of the Arke , that the ends of the staues were seene from the Arke before the Oracle , but they were not seene without . And there it is vnto this day .
There was nothing in the Arke saue the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the Lord made a couenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
¶ And it came to passe when the Priests were come out of the holy place ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course :
Also the Leuites which were the singers , all of them of Asaph , of Heman , of Ieduthun , with their sonnes and their brethren , being arayed in white linnen hauing cymbals , and psalteries , and harpes , stood at the East end of the altar , and with them an hundred and twentie Priests , sounding with trumpets : )
It came euen to passe , as the trumpetters and singers were as one , to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord : and when they lift vp their voyce with the trumpets , and cymbals , and instruments of musicke , and praised the Lord , saying , For he is good , for his mercie endureth for euer : that then the house was filled with a cloude , euen the house of the Lord .

Then said Solomon , The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thicke darkenesse .
But I haue built an house of habitation for thee , and a place for thy dwelling for euer .
And the King turned his face and blessed the whole Congregation of Israel , ( and all the Congregation of Israel stood )
And he said , Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who hath with his handes fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father Dauid , saying ,
Since the day that I brought foorth my people out of the land of Egypt , I chose no citie among all the tribes of Israel to builde an house in , that my Name might be there , neither chose I any man to be a ruler ouer my people Israel :
But I haue chosen Ierusalem , that my name might be there , and haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel .
Now it was in the heart of Dauid my father to build an house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel .
But the Lord said to Dauid my father : Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to builde an house for my Name , thou diddest well in that it was in thine heart .
Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house , but thy sonne which shall come foorth out of thy loynes , he shall build the house for my Name .
The Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken : for I am risen vp in the roome of Dauid my father , and am set on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and haue built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel .
And in it haue I put the Arke , wherein is the Couenant of the Lord , that hee made with the children of Israel .
¶ And he stood before the Altar of the Lord , in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel , and spread foorth his hands :
( For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of fiue cubites long , and fiue cubites broad , and three cubites high , and had set it in the midst of the Court , and vpon it hee stood , and kneeled downe vpon his knees before all the Congregation of Israel , and spread foorth his hands towards heauen . )
And said , O Lord God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heauen , nor in the earth , which keepest couenant , and shewest mercy vnto thy seruants , that walke before thee with all their hearts ,
Thou which hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father , that which thou hast promised him : and spakest with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
Now therefore , O Lord God of Israel , keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father , that which thou hast promised him , saying , There shall not faile thee a man in my sight , to sit vpon the throne of Israel : yet so , that thy children take heede to their way , to walke in my Law , as thou hast walked before me .
Now then , O Lord God of Israel , let thy word be verified , which thou hast spoken vnto thy seruant Dauid .
( But wil God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? Behold , heauen , and the heauen of heauens cannot conteine thee : how much lesse this house which I haue built ? )
Haue respect therfore to the prayer of thy seruant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken vnto the cry , and the prayer which thy seruant prayeth before thee :
That thine eyes may bee open vpon this house day and night , vpon the place whereof thou hast saide , that thou wouldest put thy Name there , to hearken vnto the prayer , which thy seruant prayeth towards this place .
Hearken therefore vnto the supplications of thy seruant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall make towards this place : heare thou from thy dwelling place , euen from heauen ; and when thou hearest , forgiue .
¶ If a man sinne against his neighbour , and an oath be layd vpon him , to make him sweare , and the oath come before thine Altar in this house :
Then heare thou from heauen , and doe , and iudge thy seruants by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way vpon his owne head , and by iustifying the righteous , by giuing him according to his righteousnesse .
¶ And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they haue sinned against thee , and shall returne and confesse thy Name , and pray and make supplication before thee in this house :
Then heare thou from the heauens , and forgiue the sinne of thy people Israel , and bring them againe vnto the land which thou gauest to them , and to their fathers .
¶ When the heauen is shut vp , and there is no raine , because they haue sinned against thee : yet if they pray towards this place , and confesse thy Name , and turne from their sinne , when thou doest afflict them :
Then heare thou from heauen , and forgiue the sinne of thy seruants , and of thy people Israel ; when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walke , and send raine vpon the land , which thou hast giuen vnto thy people for an inheritance .
¶ If there be dearth in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blasting , or mil - dew , locusts or caterpillers ; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land : whatsoeuer sore , or whatsoeuer sicknesse there be :
Then what prayer , or what supplication soeuer shall bee made of any man , or of all thy people Israel , when euery one shal know his owne sore and his owne griefe , and shall spread foorth his hands in this house :
Then heare thou from heauen thy dwelling place , and forgiue , and render vnto euery man according vnto all his wayes , whose heart thou knowest ( for thou onely knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
That they may feare thee , to walke in thy waies so long as they liue in the land which thou gauest vnto our fathers .
¶ Moreouer concerning the stranger which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a farre countrey for thy great Names sake , & thy mightie hand , and thy stretched out arme : if they come and pray in this house :
Then heare thou from the heauens , euen from thy dwelling place , and doe according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for ; that all people of the earth may know thy Name , and feare thee , as doeth thy people Israel , and may know that this house which I haue built , is called by thy Name .
If thy people goe out to warre against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray vnto thee toward this citie which thou hast chosen , and the house which I haue built for thy Name :
Then heare thou from the heauens their prayer and their supplication , and maintaine their cause .
If they sinne against thee ( for there is no man which sinneth not ) and thou be angry with them , and deliuer them ouer before their enemies , and they cary them away captiues vnto a land far off or neere :
Yet if they bethinke themselues in the land whither they are caried captiue , and turne and pray vnto thee in the land of their captiuitie , saying , Wee haue sinned , we haue done amisse , and haue dealt wickedly :
If they returne to thee with all their heart , and with all their soule , in the land of their captiuitie , whither they haue caried them captiues , and pray toward their land which thou gauest vnto their fathers , and toward the citie which thou hast chosen , and toward the house which I haue built for thy Name :
Then heare thou from the heauens , euen from thy dwelling place , their prayer and their supplications , and maintaine their cause , and forgiue thy people , which haue sinned against thee .
Now , my God , let ( I beseech thee ) thine eyes bee open , and let thine eares be attent vnto the prayer that is made in this place .
Now therefore arise , O Lord God , into thy resting place , thou , and the Arke of thy strength : Let thy Priests , O Lord God , be clothed with saluation , and let thy Saints reioyce in goodnesse .

Now when Solomon had made an ende of praying , the fire came downe from heauen , and consumed the burnt offering , and the sacrifices , and the glory of the Lord filled the house .
And the Priests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lords house .
And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came downe , and the glory of the Lord vpon the house , they bowed themselues with their faces to the ground vpon the pauement , and worshipped , and praised the Lord , saying , For hee is good , for his mercy endureth for euer . ¶ Then the King and all the people , offered sacrifices before the Lord .
And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twentie and two thousand oxen , and an hundred and twentie thousand sheepe . So the King and all the people , dedicated the house of God .
And the Priests waited on their offices : the Leuites also with instruments of musicke of the Lord , which Dauid the King had made to praise the Lord , because his mercy endureth for euer , when Dauid praised by their ministerie : and the Priests sounded trumpets before them , and all Israel stood .
Moreouer , Solomon hallowed the middle of the Court , that was before the house of the Lord : for there hee offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen Altar which Solomon had made , was not able to receiue the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
¶ Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seuen dayes , and all Israel with him , a very great Congregation , from the entring in of Hamath , vnto the Riuer of Egypt .
And in the eight day they made a solemne assembly : for they kept the dedication of the Altar seuen dayes , and the feast seuen dayes .
And on the three and twentieth day of the seuenth moneth , he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the goodnesse that the Lord had shewed vnto Dauid , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the Kings house : and all that came into Solomons heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his owne house , hee prosperously effected .
¶ And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night , and said vnto him , I haue heard thy prayer , and haue chosen this place to my selfe for an house of sacrifice .
If I shut vp heauen that there bee no raine , or if I command the locusts to deuoure the land , or if I send pestilence among my people :
If my people which are called by my Name , shall humble themselues and pray , and seeke my face , and turne from their wicked wayes : then will I heare from heauen , and will forgiue their sinne , and will heale their land .
Now mine eyes shalbe open , and mine eares attent vnto the prayer that is made in this place .
For now haue I chosen , & sanctified this house , that my Name may be there for euer : and mine eyes and mine heart shalbe there perpetually .
And as for thee , if thou wilt walke before me , as Dauid thy father walked , and doe according to all that I haue commanded thee , and shalt obserue my Statutes , and my Iudgements :
Then wil I stablish the throne of thy kingdome , according as I haue couenanted with Dauid thy father , saying , There shall not faile thee a man to be ruler in Israel .
But if yee turne away and forsake my Statutes and my Commandements which I haue set before you , and shall goe and serue other gods , and worship them : Then will I plucke them vp by the roots out of my land which I haue giuen them , and this house which I haue sanctified for my Name , wil I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a prouerbe , and a by - word among all nations .
And this house which is high , shall be an astonishment to euery one that passeth by it ; so that hee shall say ; Why hath the Lord done thus vnto this land , and vnto this house ?
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe ( at the end of twentie yeeres , wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord , & his own house )
That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah , and preuailed against it .
And he built Tadmor in the wildernesse , and all the store - cities , which he built in Hamath .
Also he built Beth - horon the vpper , and Beth - horon the nether , fensed cities with walles , gates and barres :
And Baalath , and all the store - cities that Solomon had , and all the charet - cities , and the cities of the horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build in Ierusalem , and in Lebanon , and throughout all the land of his dominion . ¶ As for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hiuites , and the Iebusites , which were not of Israel :
But of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not ; them did Solomon make to pay tribute , vntill this day .
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no seruants for his worke : but they were men of warre , and chiefe of his captains , and captains of his charets and horsemen .
And these were the chiefe of king Solomons officers , euen two hundred and fifty , that bare rule ouer the people .
¶ And Solomon brought vp the daughter of Pharaoh out of the citie of Dauid , vnto the house that he had built for her : for hee said , My wife shall not dwell in the house of Dauid king of Israel , because the places are holy , whereunto the Arke of the Lord hath come .
¶ Then Solomon offered burnt offerings vnto the Lord on the Altar of the Lord , which he had built before the porch :
Euen after a certaine rate euery day , offering according to the commandement of Moses , on the Sabbaths , and on the new Moones , and on the solemne Feasts three times in the yeere , euen in the feast of Unleauened bread , and in the feast of Weekes , and in the feast of Tabernacles .
¶ And he appointed , according to the order of Dauid his father , the courses of the Priests to their seruice , and the Leuites to their charges , to praise and minister before the Priests , as the duety of euery day required : the porters also by their courses , at euery gate : for so had Dauid the man of God commanded .
And they departed not from the commandement of the King vnto the Priests and Leuites , concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
Now all the worke of Solomon was prepared vnto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and vntill it was finished : so the house of God was perfected .
¶ Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber , and to Eloth , at the sea side in the land of Edom .
<NON-VERSE>
And when the Queene of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon , shee came to prooue Solomon with hard questions at Ierusalem , with a very great companie , and camels that bare spices , and golde in abundance , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , shee communed with him of all that was in her heart .
And Solomon tolde her all her questions : and there was nothing hid from Solomon , which he told her not .
And when the Queene of Sheba had seene the wisedome of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
And the meate of his table , and the sitting of his seruants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparell , his cup - bearers also , and their apparell , and his ascent , by which hee went vp into the house of the Lord ; there was no more spirit in her .
And she said to the King , It was a true report which I heard in mine owne land , of thine actes , and of thy wisedome :
Howbeit , I beleeued not their wordes , vntill I came , and mine eyes had seene it : and behold , the one halfe of the greatnesse of thy wisedome was not tolde mee : for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
Happy are thy men , and happy are these thy seruants , which stand continually before thee , and heare thy wisedome .
Blessed be the Lord thy God , which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne , to be King for the Lord thy God : because thy God loued Israel , to establish them for euer , therefore made hee thee King ouer them , to doe iudgement and iustice .
And she gaue the king an hundred and twentie talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , & precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the Queene of Sheba gaue King Solomon .
And the seruants also of Huram , and the seruants of Solomon , which brought gold from Ophir , brought Algume trees and , precious stones .
And the king made of the Algume trees , terrises to the house of the Lord , and to the kings palace , and harpes and psalteries for singers : and there were none such seene before in the laud of Iudah .
And King Solomon gaue to the Queene of Sheba , all her desire , whatsoeuer she asked , besides that which she had brought vnto the king : So she turned , and went away to her owne land , she , and her seruants . ¶ Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one yeere , was sixe hundred and threescore and sixe talents of gold :
Besides that which chapmen and merchants brought : and all the kings of Arabia , and gouernours of the countrie , brought gold and siluer to Solomon .
¶ And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : sixe hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target .
And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forrest of Lebanon .
Moreouer the king made a great throne of yuorie , and ouerlaid it with pure gold .
And there were sixe steps to the throne , with a footstoole of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stayes on each side of the sitting place , and two lyons standing by the stayes .
And twelue lyons stood there on the one side and on the other , vpon the sixe steps . There was not the like made in any kingdome .
¶ And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forrest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of siluer ; it was not any thing accounted of in the dayes of Solomon .
For the kings ships went to Tarshish with the seruants of Huram : euerie three yeeres once came the ships of Tarshish bringing golde , and siluer , yuorie , and apes , and peacocks .
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisedome .
¶ And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to heare his wisedome , that God had put in his heart .
And they brought euery man his present , vessels of siluer , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harnesse , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate yeere by yeere .
¶ And Solomon had foure thousand stalles for horses , and charets , and twelue thousand horsemen , whom hee bestowed in the charet cities , and with the king at Ierusalem .
¶ And hee reigned ouer all the kings , from the riuer , euen vnto the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt .
And the king made siluer in Ierusalem as stones , and cedar trees made he as the Sycomore trees , that are in the low plaines , in abundance .
And they brought vnto Solomon horses out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Solomon first and last , are they not written in the booke of Nathan the Prophet , and in the prophesie of Ahiiah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the Seer , against Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat ?
And Solomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel , fourtie yeeres .
<NON-VERSE>
And Rehoboam went to Shechem : for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king .
And it came to passe when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat ( who was in Egypt , whither hee had fled from the presence of Solomon the king ) heard it , that Ieroboam returned out of Egypt .
And they sent and called him . So Ieroboam and all Israel came , and spake to Rehoboam , saying ,
Thy father made our yoke grieuous , nowe therefore ease thou somewhat the grieuous seruitude of thy father , and his heauy yoke that he put vpon vs , and we will serue thee .
And hee said vnto them , Come againe vnto me after three dayes . And the people departed .
¶ And king Rehoboam tooke counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father , while hee yet liued , saying , What counsell giue ye me , to returne answere to this people ?
And they spake vnto him , saying , If thou bee kinde to this people , and please them , and speake good words to them , they will be thy seruants for euer .
But he forsooke the counsel which the old men gaue him , and tooke counsell with the yong men , that were brought vp with him , that stood before him .
And he said vnto them , What aduice giue ye , that wee may returne answere to this people , which haue spoken to me , saying , Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put vpon vs ?
And the yong men that were brought vp with him , spake vnto him , saying , Thus shalt thou answere the people that spake vnto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heauy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for vs : thus shalt thou say vnto them , My litle finger shall be thicker then my fathers loynes .
For where as my father put a heauy yoke vpon you , I will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
So Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day , as the King bade , saying , Come againe to me on the third day .
And the king answered them roughly , and king Rehoboam forsooke the counsell of the old men ,
And answered them after the aduice of the yong men , saying , My father made your yoke heauy , but I will adde thereto : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
So the king hearkened not vnto the people , for the cause was of God , that the Lord might performe his word , which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat .
¶ And when all Israel sawe that the king would not hearken vnto them , the people answered the king saying , What portion haue wee in Dauid ? and wee haue none inheritance in the sonne of Iesse : Euery man to your tents , O Israel : and now Dauid , see to thine owne house . So all Israel went to their tents .
But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Iudah , Rehoboam reigned ouer them .
Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was ouer the tribute , and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died : but king Rehoboam made speed to get him vp to his charet , to flee to Ierusalem .
<NON-VERSE>
And when Rehoboam was come to Ierusalem , he gathered of the house of Iudah and Beniamin , an hundred and fourescore thousand chosen men , which were warriers , to fight against Israel , that hee might bring the kingdome againe to Rehoboam .
But the worde of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
Speake vnto Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Iudah , and to all Israel in Iudah & Beniamin , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord ; Ye shall not goe vp , nor fight against your brethren : returne euery man to his house , for this thing is done of me . And they obeyed the words of the Lord , and returned from going against Ieroboam .
¶ And Rehoboam dwelt in Ierusalem , and built cities for defence in Iudah . He built euen Bethlehem , and Etam , and Tekoa ,
And Bethzur , and Shoco , and Adullam , And Gath , and Maresha , and Ziph ,
And Adoraim , and Lachish , and Azekah , And Zorah , and Aialon , and Hebron , which are in Iudah and in Beniamin , fenced cities .
And he fortified the strong holds , and put captaines in them , and store of vitaile , and of oyle and wine .
And in euery seuerall citie he put shields and speares , and made them exceeding strong , hauing Iudah and Beniamin on his side .
¶ And the Priests and the Leuites that were in all Israel , resorted to him out of all their coasts .
For the Leuites left their suburbs , and their possession , and came to Iudah and Ierusalem : for Ieroboam and his sonnes had cast them off from executing the Priests office vnto the Lord .
And hee ordeined him priests for the high places , and for the deuils , and for the calues which he had made .
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seeke the Lord God of Israel , came to Ierusalem , to sacrifice vnto the Lord God of their fathers .
So they strengthened the kingdome of Iudah , and made Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon strong , three yeeres : for three yeeres they walked in the way of Dauid and Solomon .
¶ And Rehoboam tooke him Mahalath the daughter of Ierimoth the sonne of Dauid to wife , and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Iesse :
Which bare him children , Ieush , and Shamariah , and Zaham .
And after her , hee tooke Maacah the daughter of Absalom , which bare him Abiiah , and Atthai , and Ziza , and Shelomith .
And Rehoboam loued Maacah the daughter of Absalom , aboue all his wiues and his concubines : for he tooke eighteene wiues , and threescore concubines , and begate twentie and eight sonnes , and threescore daughters .
And Rehoboam made Abiiah the sonne of Maacah the chiefe , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when Rehoboam had established the kingdome , and had strengthened himselfe , hee forsooke the Law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
And it came to passe , that in the fifth yere of Rehoboam , Shishak king of Egypt came vp against Ierusalem , ( because they had transgressed against the Lord )
With twelue hundred charets , and threescore thousand horsemen : and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt : the Lubims , the Sukkiims , & the Ethiopians .
And hee tooke the fenced cities which perteined to Iudah , and came to Ierusalem .
¶ Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam , and to the Princes of Iudah that were gathered together to Ierusalem because of Shishak , and said vnto them , Thus saith the Lord , Ye haue forsaken me , and therfore haue I also left you in the hand of Shishak .
Whereupon , the Princes of Israel , and the king humbled themselues and they saide , The Lord is righteous .
And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselues , the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah , saying , They haue humbled themselues , therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliuerance , and my wrath shall not bee powred out vpon Ierusalem , by the hand of Shishak .
Neuerthelesse they shalbe his seruants , that they may know my seruice , and the seruice of the kingdomes of the countreys .
So Shishak king of Egypt came vp against Ierusalem , and tooke away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the kings house , hee tooke all : he caried away also the shields of gold , which Solomon had made .
In stead of which , king Rehoboam made shields of brasse , and committed them to the hands of the chiefe of the guard , that kept the entrance of the Kings house .
And when the king entred into the house of the Lord , the guard came and fet them , and brought them againe into the guard - chamber .
And when he humbled himselfe , the wrath of the Lord turned from him , that hee would not destroy him altogether : and also in Iudah things went well .
¶ So king Rehoboam strengthened himselfe in Ierusalem , and reigned : for Rehoboam was one and fourty yeeres olde when hee began to reigne , and he reigned seuenteen yeeres in Ierusalem , the citie which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his Name there : and his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitesse .
And hee did euill , because hee prepared not his heart to seeke the Lord .
Now the acts of Rehoboam first and last , are they not written in the booke of Shemaiah the Prophet , and of Iddo the Seer , concerning genealogies ? and there were warres betweene Rehoboam & Ieroboam continually .
<NON-VERSE>
Nowe in the eighteenth yeere of king Ieroboam , began Abiiah to reigne ouer Iudah .
He reigned three yeres in Ierusalem : ( his mothers name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibea : ) and there was warre between Abiiah and Ieroboam .
And Abiiah set the battel in aray with an army of valiant men of warre , euen foure hundred thousand chosen men : Ieroboam also set the battell in aray against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , being mightie men of valour .
¶ And Abiiah stood vp vpon mount Zemaraim , which is in mount Ephraim , and sayde , Heare mee thou Ieroboam , and all Israel :
Ought you not to know , that the Lord God of Israel gaue the kingdome ouer Israel to Dauid for euer , euen to him and to his sonnes by a couenant of salt ?
Yet Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , the seruant of Solomon the sonne of Dauid , is risen vp , and hath rebelled against his Lord .
And there are gathered vnto him vaine men the children of Belial , and haue strengthened themselues against Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young , & tender hearted , and could not withstand them .
And now ye thinke to withstand the kingdome of the Lord , in the hand of the sonnes of Dauid , and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden calues , which Ieroboam made you for gods .
Haue yee not cast out the Priests of the Lord the sonnes of Aaron , and the Leuites , and haue made you priests after the maner of the nations of other lands ? so that whosoeuer commeth to consecrate himselfe with a young bullocke and seuen rammes , the same may be a priest of them that are no gods .
But as for vs , the Lord is our God , and wee haue not forsaken him , and the Priests which minister vnto the Lord , are the sonnes of Aaron , and the Leuites waite vpon their businesse .
And they burne vnto the Lord euery morning , and euery euening , burnt sacrifices and sweete incense : the shew - bread also set they in order vpon the pure table , and the Candlesticke of golde with the lampes therof , to burne euery euening : for we keepe the charge of the Lord our God , but yee haue forsaken him .
And behold , God himselfe is with vs for our captaine , and his Priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarme against you : O children of Israel , fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers , for you shall not prosper .
¶ But Ieroboam caused an ambushment to come about behinde them : so they were before Iudah , and the ambushment was behind them .
And when Iudah looked backe , behold , the battel was before and behind ; and they cried vnto the Lord , and the Priests sounded with the trumpets .
Then the men of Iudah gaue a shout : and as the men of Iudah shouted , it came to passe that God smote Ieroboam and all Israel , before Abiiah and Iudah .
And the children of Israel fled before Iudah : and God deliuered them into their hand .
And Abiiah and his people slew them with a great slaughter : so there fel downe slaine of Israel , fiue hundred thousand chosen men .
Thus the children of Israel were brought vnder at that time , and the children of Iudah preuailed , because they relied vpon the Lord God of their fathers .
And Abiiah pursued after Ieroboam , & tooke cities from him , Beth - el with the townes thereof , and Ieshanah with the townes thereof , and Ephrain with the townes thereof .
Neither did Ieroboam recouer strength againe in the dayes of Abiiah : and the Lord strooke him , & he died .
¶ But Abiiah waxed mighty , and married fourteene wiues , and begate twentie and two sonnes , and sixteene daughters .
<NON-VERSE>
So Abiiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the citie of Dauid , and Asa his sonne reigned in his stead : in his dayes the land was quiet ten yeeres .
And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God .
For hee tooke away the altars of the strange gods , and the high places , and brake downe the images , and cut downe the groues :
And commanded Iudah to seeke the Lord God of their fathers , and to do the Law , and the Commandement .
Also he tooke away out of all the cities of Iudah , the high places and the images : and the kingdome was quiet before him .
¶ And hee built fenced cities in Iudah ; for the land had rest , and hee had no warre in those yeeres ; because the Lord had giuen him rest .
Therefore hee said vnto Iudah , Let vs build these cities , & make about them walles , and towers , gates and barres , while the land is yet before vs : because wee haue sought the Lord our God , wee haue sought him , and hee hath giuen vs rest on euery side : so they built , and prospered .
And Asa had an armie of men that bare targets and speares , out of Iudah three hundred thousand , and out of Beniamin , that bare shields and drew bowes , two hundred and fourescore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
¶ And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian , with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred charets , and came vnto Mareshah .
Then Asa went out against him , and they set the battel in aray in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
And Asa cried vnto the Lord his God , and said , Lord , it is nothing with thee to helpe , whether with many , or with them that haue no power . Helpe vs , O Lord our God , for we rest on thee , and in thy Name wee goe against this multitude : O Lord thou art our God , let not man preuaile against thee .
So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa , and before Iudah , and the Ethiopians fled .
And Asa and the people that were with him , pursued them vnto Gerar : and the Ethiopians were ouerthrown , that they could not recouer themselues , for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his hoste , and they caried away very much spoile .
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar , for the feare of the Lord came vpon them : and they spoiled all the cities , for there was exceeding much spoile in them .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Spirit of God came vpon Azariah the sonne of Oded .
And he went out to meet Asa , and said vnto him , Heare ye me , Asa , and all Iudah , and Beniamin , The Lord is with you , while yee be with him : and if yee seeke him , he will be found of you : but if ye forsake him , he will forsake you .
Now for a long season Israel hath bene without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
And nation was destroyed of nation , and citie of citie : for God did vexe them with all aduersitie .
Be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands bee weake : for your worke shall be rewarded .
And when Asa heard these words , and the prophesie of Oded the prophet , he tooke courage , and put away the abominable idoles out of all the lande of Iudah and Beniamin , and out of the cities which hee had taken from mount Ephraim , and renewed the Altar of the Lord , that was before the porch of the Lord .
And he gathered all Iudah and Beniamin , and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon : ( for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the Lord his God was with him . )
So they gathered themselues together at Ierusalem , in the third moneth , in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Asa .
And they offered vnto the Lord the same time , of the spoile which they had brought , seuen hundred oxen , and seuen thousand sheepe .
And they entred into a couenant to seeke the Lord God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soule :
That whosoeuer would not seeke the Lord God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
And they sware vnto the Lord with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
And all Iudah reioyced at the oath : for they had sworne with all their heart , & sought him with their whole desire , and he was found of them : and the Lord gaue them rest round about .
¶ And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king , he remooued her from beeing Queene , because she had made an idole in a groue : and Asa cut downe her idole , and stamped it , and burnt it at the brooke Kidron .
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel : neuerthelesse the heart of Asa was perfect all his dayes .
¶ And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himselfe had dedicated , siluer , and gold , and vessels .
<NON-VERSE>
In the sixe and thirtieth yeere of the reigne of Asa , Baasha king of Israel came vp against Iudah , and built Ramah , to the intent that hee might let none goe out or come in to Asa king of Iudah .
Then Asa brought out siluer and golde out of the treasures of the house of the Lord , and of the kings house , and sent to Benhadad King of Syria that dwelt at Damascus , saying ;
There is a league betweene me and thee , as there was betweene my father and thy father : beholde , I haue sent thee siluer and golde , goe , breake thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me .
And Benhadad hearkened vnto king Asa , and sent the captaines of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Iion , and Dan , and Abelmaim , & all the store - cities of Naphtali .
And it came to passe , when Baasha heard it , that hee left off building of Ramah , and let his worke cease .
Then Asa the king tooke all Iudah , and they caried away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha was a building , and hee built there with Geba and Mizpah .
¶ And at that time Hanani the Seer came to Asa king of Iudah , and said vnto him , Because thou hast relyed on the king of Syria , and not relyed on the Lord thy God , therefore is the hoste of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge hoste , with very many charets and horsemen ? Yet because thou diddest relie on the Lord , he deliuered them into thine hand .
For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to shewe himselfe strong in the behalfe of them , whose heart is perfite towards him . Herein thou hast done foolishly ; therefore , from hencefoorth thou shalt haue warres .
Then Asa was wroth with the Seer , and put him in a prison - house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time .
¶ And behold , the actes of Asa first and last , lo , they are written in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel .
And Asa in the thirtie and ninth yeere of his reigne , was diseased in his feete , vntill his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease hee sought not to the Lord , but to the Physicians .
¶ And Asa slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fourtieth yeere of his reigne .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iehoshaphat his sonne reigned in his stead , and strengthened himselfe against Israel .
But sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his commandements , and not after the doings of Israel :
Therefore the Lord stablished the kingdome in his hand , and all Iudah brought to Iehoshaphat presents , and he had riches and honour in abundance .
And his heart was lift vp in the wayes of the Lord : moreouer hee tooke away the high places and groues out of Iudah .
¶ Also in the third yeere of his reigne , hee sent to his princes , euen to Benhail , and to Obadiah , and to Zechariah , and to Nethaneel , and to Michaiah , to teach in the cities of Iudah :
¶ And the feare of the Lord fell vpon all the kingdomes of the lands that were round about Iudah , so that they made no warre against Iehoshaphat .
Also some of the Philistines brought Iehoshaphat presents , and tribute siluer , and the Arabians brought him flocks , seuen thousand and seuen hundred rammes , and seuen thousand and seuen hundred he goats . ¶ And Iehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly , and he built in Iudah castles , and cities of store .
And of Beniamin , Eliada a mightie man of valour , and with him , armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand . And next him was Iehoshabad , and with him an hundred and foure score thousand , ready prepared for the warre .
<NON-VERSE>
Now Iehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance , and ioyned affinitie with Ahab .
And after certaine yeeres , he went downe to Ahab to Samaria : and Ahab killed sheepe and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that he had with him , and perswaded him to goe vp with him to Ramoth Gilead .
And Ahab king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat king of Iudah , Wilt thou goe with me to Ramoth Gilead ? And he answered him , I am as thou art , and my people as thy people , and we will be with thee in the warre .
¶ And Iehoshaphat saide vnto the king of Israel , Enquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord to day .
Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets foure hundred men , and said vnto them , Shal we goe to Ramoth Gilead to battel , or shal I forbeare ? And they said , Goe vp , for God will deliuer it into the kings hand .
But Iehoshaphat saide , Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord besides , that we might enquire of him ?
And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat , There is yet one man , by whom we may enquire of the Lord : but I hate him , for he neuer prophesied good vnto me , but alwayes euill : the same is Micaiah the sonne of Iimla . And Iehoshaphat saide , Let not the king say so .
And the king of Israel called for one of his officers , and saide , Fetch quickly Micaiah the sonne of Iimla .
And the king of Israel and Iehoshaphat king of Iudah sate , either of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sate in a voide place at the entring in of the gate of Samaria , and all the prophets prophesied before them .
And Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah , had made him hornes of yron , and said , Thus saith the Lord , With these thou shalt push Syria , vntil they be consumed .
And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead , and prosper : for the Lord shall deliuer it into the hand of the king .
And the messenger that went to call Micaiah , spake to him , saying , Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent : let thy word therefore , I pray thee be like one of theirs , and speake thou good .
And Micaiah said , As the Lord liueth , euen what my God saith , that will I speake .
And when hee was come to the king , the king sayd vnto him , Micaiah , shall we goe to Ramoth Gilead to battell , or shall I fobreare ? and he sayd , Goe yee vp , and prosper , and they shall be deliuered into your hand .
And the king sayd to him , Howe many times shall I adiure thee , that thou say nothing but the truth to me , in the name of the Lord ?
Then he sayd , I did see all Israel scattered vpon the mountaines , as sheepe that haue no shepheard : and the Lord sayd , These haue no master , let them returne therefore , euery man to his house in peace .
( And the king of Israel sayd to Iehoshaphat , Did I not tell thee , that hee would not prophesie good vnto mee , but euill ? )
Againe he sayd ; Therefore heare the word of the Lord : I sawe the Lord sitting vpon his throne , and all the hoste of heauen standing on his right hand , and on his left .
And the Lord sayd , Who shall entise Ahab king of Israel , that hee may goe vp and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? And one spake , saying after this maner , and another saying after that maner .
Then there came out a spirit , and stood before the Lord , and sayd , I will entise him . And the Lord sayd vnto him , Wherewith ?
And hee sayd , I will goe out , and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . And the Lord sayd , Thou shalt entise him , and thou shalt also preuaile : goe out , and doe euen so .
Nowe therefore behold , the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the Lord hath spoken euill against thee .
Then Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah , came neere , and smote Micaiah vpon the cheeke , and sayd , Which way went the spirit of the Lord from mee , to speake vnto thee ?
And Micaiah sayd , Behold , thou shalt see on that day , when thou shalt goe into an inner chamber to hide thy selfe .
Then the king of Israel sayd , Take yee Micaiah , and carie him backe to Amon the gouernour of the citie , and to Ioash the kings sonne :
And say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feede him with bread of affliction , and with water of affliction , vntill I returne in peace .
And Micaiah sayd , If thou certainly returne in peace , then hath not the Lord spoken by mee . And hee sayd , Hearken all yee people .
So the king of Israel , and Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah , went vp to Ramoth Gilead .
And the king of Israel sayd vnto Iehoshaphat , I will disguise my selfe , and will goe to the battell , but put thou on thy robes . So the king of Israel disguised himselfe , and they went to the battell .
Now the king of Syria had commaunded the captaines of the charets that were with him , saying , Fight ye not with small or great , saue onely with the king of Israel .
And it came to passe when the captaines of the charets saw Iehoshaphat , that they sayd , It is the king of Israel : therefore they compassed about him to fight . But Iehoshaphat cryed out , and the Lord helped him , and God moued them to depart from him .
For it came to passe , that when the captaines of the charets perceiued that it was not the king of Israel , they turned backe againe from pursuing him .
And a certaine man drew a bowe at a venture , and smote the king of Israel betweene the ioints of the harnesse : therefore hee sayd to his charetman , Turne thine hand , that thou mayest carie me out of the hoste , for I am wounded .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah returned to his house in peace to Ierusalem .
And Iehu the sonne of Hanani the seer , went out to meete him , and sayd to king Iehoshaphat , Shouldest thou helpe the vngodly , and loue them that hate the Lord ? Therefore is wrath vpon thee from before the Lord .
Neuerthelesse , there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groues out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seeke God .
And Iehoshaphat dwelt at Ierusalem : and hee went out againe through the people , from Beer - sheba to mount Ephraim , and brought them backe vnto the Lord God of their fathers .
¶ And he set Iudges in the land , throughout all the fenced cities of Iudah , city by city ,
And said to the Iudges , Take heed what ye doe : for yee iudge not for man , but for the Lord , who is with you in the iudgement .
Wherefore now , let the feare of the Lord be vpon you , take heed and doe it : for there is no iniquitie with the Lord our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of gifts .
¶ Moreouer in Ierusalem did Iehoshaphat set of the Leuites , and of the Priests , and of the chiefe of the fathers of Israel , for the iudgement of the Lord , and for controuersies , when they returned to Ierusalem .
And hee charged them , saying , Thus shall yee doe in the feare of the Lord faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
And what cause soeuer shal come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities , betweene blood and blood , betweene Law and Commandement , Statutes and Iudgements , yee shall euen warne them that they trespasse not against the Lord , and so wrath come vpon you , and vpon your brethren : this doe , & ye shall not trespasse .
<NON-VERSE>
It came to passe after this also , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them , other beside the Ammonites , came against Iehoshaphat to battell .
Then there came some that tolde Iehoshaphat , saying , There commeth a great multitude against thee from beyond the Sea on this side Syria , and behold , they bee in Hazazon - Tamar , which is En - gedi .
And Iehoshaphat feared , and set himselfe to seeke the Lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Iudah .
And Iudah gathered themselues together , to aske helpe of the Lord : euen out of all the cities of Iudah they came to seeke the Lord .
¶ And Iehoshaphat stood in the Congregation of Iudah and Ierusalem , in the house of the Lord before the new Court ,
And said , O Lord God of our fathers , art not thou God in heauen ? and rulest not thou ouer all the kingdoms of the heathen ? and in thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
Art not thou our God , who didst driue out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and gauest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for euer ?
And they dwelt therein , and haue built thee a Sanctuarie therein for thy Name , saying ,
If , when euill commeth vpon vs , as the sword , iudgement , or pestilence , or famine , wee stand before this house , and in thy presence ( for thy Name is in this house ) and cry vnto thee in our affliction , then thou wilt heare & helpe .
And now behold , the children of Ammon , and Moab , and mount Seir , whom thou wouldest not let Israel inuade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not :
Beholde , I say , how they reward vs , to come to cast vs out of thy possession , which thou hast giuen vs to inherit .
O our God , wilt thou not iudge them ? for wee haue no might against this great company that commeth against vs ? neither know wee what to doe ; but our eyes are vpon thee .
And all Iudah stood before the Lord , with their litle ones , their wiues and their children .
¶ Then vpon Iahaziel the sonne of Zechariah , the sonne of Benaiah , the sonne of Iehiel , the sonne of Mattaniah , a Leuite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the Congregation :
And he said , Hearken yee , all Iudah , and ye inhabitants of Ierusalem , and thou king Iehoshaphat , Thus sayth the Lord vnto you ; Be not afraid , nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battell is not yours , but Gods .
To morrow goe ye downe against them : behold , they come vp by the cliffe of Ziz , and ye shall finde them at the end of the brooke , before the wildernesse of Ieruel .
Yee shall not neede to fight in this battell ; set your selues , stand yee still , and see the saluation of the Lord with you , O Iudah and Ierusalem : feare not , nor be dismayed ; to morow goe out against them , for the Lord will bee with you .
And Iehoshaphat bowed his head , with his face to the ground : and all Iudah , and the inhabitants of Ierusalem , fell before the Lord , worshipping the Lord .
And the Leuites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the children of the Korhites , stood vp to praise the Lord God of Israel , with a loude voice on high .
¶ And they rose early in the morning , and went foorth into the wildernesse of Tekoa : and as they went forth , Iehoshaphat stood and said , Heare me , O Iudah , and yee inhabitants of Ierusalem ; Beleeue in the Lord your God , so shall you be established ; beleeue his Prophets , so shall yee prosper .
And when he had consulted with the people , he appointed Singers vnto the Lord , and that should praise the beautie of holinesse , as they went out before the armie ; and to say , Praise the Lord , for his mercy endureth for euer .
¶ And when they beganne to sing and to praise , the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which were come against Iudah , and they were smitten .
For the children of Ammon and Moab , stood vp against the inhabitants of mount Seir , vtterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , euery one helped to destroy another .
And when Iudah came toward the watch - tower in the wildernesse , they looked vnto the multitude , and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
And when Iehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoile of them , they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies , and precious iewels ( which they stript off for themselues ) more then they could cary away : and they were three dayes in gathering of the spoile , it was so much .
¶ And on the fourth day they assembled themselues in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the Lord : therfore the name of the same place was called the valley of Berachah vnto this day .
Then they returned , euery man of Iudah and Ierusalem , and Iehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go againe to Ierusalem with ioy : for the Lord had made them to reioyce ouer their enemies .
And they came to Ierusalem with Psalteries , and harpes , and trumpets , vnto the house of the Lord .
And the feare of God was on all the kingdoms of those countreys , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel .
So the Realme of Iehoshaphat was quiet ; for his God gaue him rest round about .
¶ And Iehoshaphat reigned ouer Iudah : Hee was thirtie and fiue yeeres olde when hee began to reigne , and he reigned twentie and fiue yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
And he walked in the way of Asa his father , and departed not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts vnto the God of their fathers .
Now the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat first and last , behold , they are written in the booke of Iehu the sonne of Hanani ; who is mentioned in the booke of the Kings of Israel .
¶ And after this did Iehoshaphat king of Iudah ioine himselfe with Ahaziah king of Israel , who did very wickedly :
And he ioyned himselfe with him to make ships to goe to Tarshish : and they made the ships in Ezion - Geber .
<NON-VERSE>
Now Iehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid : and Iehoram his sonne reigned in his stead .
And he had brethren the sonnes of Iehoshaphat , Azariah , and Iehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : All these were the sonnes of Iehoshaphat king of Israel .
And their father gaue them great giftes of siluer and of golde , and of precious things , with fenced cities in Iudah : but the kingdome gaue hee to Iehoram , because he was the first borne .
Now when Iehoram was risen vp to the kingdome of his father , he strengthened himselfe , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and diuers also of the Princes of Israel .
¶ Iehoram was thirtie and two yeeres olde when hee began to reigne , and hee reigned eight yeeres in Ierusalem .
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for hee had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was euill in the eyes of the Lord .
Howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of Dauid , because of the couenant that hee had made with Dauid , and as hee promised , to giue a light to him and to his sons for euer .
¶ In his dayes the Edomites reuolted from vnder the dominion of Iudah , and made themselues a king .
Then Iehoram went forth with his Princes , and all his charets with him : and he rose vp by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him in , and the captaines of the charets .
So the Edomites reuolted from vnder the hand of Iudah vnto this day . The same time also did Libnah reuolt from vnder his hand , because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers .
Moreouer , he made high places in the mountaines of Iudah , and caused the inhabitants of Ierusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Iudah thereto .
¶ And there came a writing to him from Eliiah the Prophet , saying , Thus saith the Lord God of Dauid thy father , Because thou hast not walked in the wayes of Iehoshaphat thy father , nor in the wayes of Asa king of Iudah :
But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem to goe a whoring , like to the whoredomes of the house of Ahab , and also hast slaine thy brethren of thy fathers house , which were better then thy selfe :
Behold , with a great plague wil the Lord smite thy people , and thy children , and thy wiues , and all thy goods .
And thou shalt haue great sicknesse by disease of thy bowels , vntil thy bowels fall out , by reason of the sickenesse day by day .
¶ Moreouer , the Lord stirred vp against Iehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians , that were neere the Ethiopians .
And they came vp into Iudah , and brake into it , and caried away all the substance that was found in the kings house , and his sonnes also and his wiues ; so that there was neuer a sonne left him , saue Iehoahaz , the yongest of his sonnes .
¶ And after all this , the Lord smote him in his bowels , with an incurable disease .
And it came to passe , that in processe of time , after the end of two yeres , his bowels fell out by reason of his sickenesse : so hee dyed of sore diseases . And his people made no burning for him , like the burning of his fathers .
<NON-VERSE>
And the inhabitants of Ierusalem made Ahaziah his yongest sonne , king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the campe , had slaine all the eldest . So Ahaziah the sonne of Iehoram king of Iudah reigned .
Fourtie and two yeeres old was Ahaziah , when he began to reigne , and he reigned one yeere in Ierusalem : his mothers name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
Hee also walked in the wayes of the house of Ahab : for his mother was his counseller to doe wickedly .
Wherefore he did euill in the sight of the Lord , like the house of Ahab : for they were his counsellers after the death of his father , to his destruction .
¶ He walked also after their counsell , and went with Iehoram the sonne of Ahab king of Israel , to warre against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead : and the Syrians smote Ioram .
And he returned to bee healed in Iezreel , because of the wounds which were giuen him at Ramah when hee fought with Hazael king of Syria . And Azariah the sonne of Iehoram king of Iudah , went downe to see Iehoram the sonne of Ahab at Iezreel , because he was sicke .
And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by comming to Ioram : For when he was come , hee went out with Iehoram against Iehu the sonne of Nimshi , whome the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab .
And it came to passe , that when Iehu was executing iudgement vpon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Iudah , and the sonnes of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministred to Ahaziah , he slew them .
And he sought Ahaziah : and they caught him ( for he was hid in Samaria ) and brought him to Iehu : and when they had slaine him , they buried him : because , said they , hee is the sonne of Iehoshaphat , who sought the Lord with all his heart . So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keepe still the kingdome .
¶ But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah , sawe that her sonne was dead , shee arose , and destroyed all the seed royall of the house of Iudah .
But Iehoshabeath the daughter of the king , tooke Ioash the sonne of Ahaziah , and stole him from among the kings sonnes , that were slaine , and put him and his nurse in a bed chamber . So Iehoshabeath the daughter of king Iehoram , the wife of Iehoiada the priest ( for she was the sister of Ahaziah ) hid him from Athaliah , so that she slew him not .

And in the seuenth yeere Iehoiada strengthened himselfe , and tooke the captaines of hundreds , Azariah the sonne of Ieroham , and Ishmael the sonne of Iehohanan , and Azariah the sonne of Obed , and Maasiah the sonne of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the sonne of Zichri , into couenant with him .
And they went about in Iudah , and gathered the Leuites out of all the cities of Iudah , and the chiefe of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Ierusalem .
And all the Congregation made a couenant with the king in the house of God : and he said vnto them , Beholde , the kings sonne shall reigne , as the Lord hath said of the sonnes of Dauid .
This is the thing that yee shall doe , A third part of you entring on the Sabbath , of the priests and of the Leuites , shalbe porters of the doores .
And a thirde part shall bee at the kings house , and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the Courts of the house of the Lord .
But let none come into the house of the Lord , saue the Priests , & they that minister of the Leuites , they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keepe the watch of the Lord .
And the Leuites shall compasse the king round about , euery man with his weapons in his hand , and whosoeuer else commeth into the house , hee shalbe put to death : but be you with the King when he commeth in , and when he goeth out .
So the Leuites and all Iudah did according to all things that Iehoiada the Priest had commanded : and tooke euery man his men that were to come in on the Sabbath , with them that were to goe out on the Sabbath : for Iehoiada the Priest dismissed not the courses .
Moreouer , Iehoiada the Priest deliuered to the captaines of hundreds , speares and bucklers , and shields , that had bene King Dauids , which were in the house of God .
And hee set all the people ( euery man hauing his weapon in his hand ) from the right side of the Temple , to the left side of the Temple , along by the Altar and the Temple , by the King , round about .
Then they brought out the kings sonne , and put vpon him the Crowne , and gaue him the Testimony , and made him King : and Iehoiada and his sonnes anointed him , and said , God saue the King .
¶ Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the King ; she came to the people into the house of the Lord .
And she looked , and behold , the king stood at his pillar , at the entring in , and the Princes , and the trumpets by the King : and all the people of the land reioyced , and sounded with trumpets ; also the singers with instruments of musicke ; and such as taught to sing praise . Then Athaliah rent her clothes , and said , Treason , treason .
Then Iehoiada the Priest brought out the captaines of hundreds , that were set ouer the host , and said vnto them , Haue her foorth of the ranges : and who so followeth her , let him bee slaine with the sword . For the Priest said ; Slay her not in the house of the Lord .
So they layd handes on her , and when shee was come to the entring of the horse gate , by the kings house , they slew her there .
¶ And Iehoiada made a couenant betweene him , and betweene all the people , and betweene the king , that they should be the Lords people .
Then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it downe , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
Also Iehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the Priests the Leuites , whom Dauid had distributed in the house of the Lord , to offer the burnt offrings of the Lord , as it is written in the Law of Moses , with reioycing and with singing , as it was ordeined by Dauid .
And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord , that none which was vncleane in any thing , should enter in .
And hee tooke the captaines of hundreds , and the nobles , and the gouernours of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought downe the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the kings house , and set the king vpon the throne of the kingdome .

Ioash was seuen yeeres old when he beganne to reigne ; and he reigned fortie yeeres in Ierusalem : his mothers name also was Zibiah , of Beer - sheba .
And Ioash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , all the dayes of Iehoiada the Priest .
And Iehoiada tooke for him two wiues , and he begat sonnes and daughters .
¶ And it came to passe after this that Ioash was minded to repaire the house of the Lord .
And hee gathered together the priests and the Leuites , and saide to them , Go out vnto the cities of Iudah , and gather of all Israel money to repaire the house of your God from yeere to yere , and see that ye haste the matter : howbeit the Leuites hastened it not .
And the king called for Iehoiada the chiefe , and saide vnto him , Why hast thou not required of the Leuites to bring in out of Iudah and out of Ierusalem , the collection , according to the commandement of Moses the seruant of the Lord , and of the Congregation of Israel , for the tabernacle of Witnesse ?
For the sonnes of Athaliah that wicked woman , had broken vp the house of God , and also all the dedicate things of the house of the Lord , did they bestow vpon Baalim .
And at the kings commandement they made a chest , and set it without , at the gate of the house of the Lord .
And they made a proclamation through Iudah & Ierusalem , to bring in to the Lord , the collection that Moses the seruant of God laid vpon Israel in the wildernesse .
And all the Princes and all the people reioyced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , vntill they had made an ende .
Now it came to passe that at what time the chest was brought vnto the kings office , by the hand of the Leuites : and when they sawe that there was much money : the kings Scribe , and the high priests officer , came and emptied the chest , and tooke it , and caried it to his place againe . Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
And the king and Iehoiada gaue it to such as did the worke of the seruice of the house of the Lord , and hired Masons and carpenters to repaire the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought yron and brasse to mend the house of the Lord .
So the workemen wrought , and the worke was perfected by them : and they set the house of God in his state , and strengthened it .
And when they had finished it , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Iehoiada , whereof were made vessels for the house of the Lord , euen vessels to minister and to offer withall , and spoones , and vessels of golde and siluer : and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually , all the dayes of Iehoiada .
¶ But Iehoiada waxed old , and was full of dayes when hee died : an hundred and thirtie yeeres olde was hee when hee died .
And they buried him in the citie of Dauid among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both towards God , and towards his house .
Now after the death of Iehoiada , came the Princes of Iudah , and made obeysance to the king : then the king hearkened vnto them .
And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers , and serued groues and idols : and wrath came vpon Iudah and Ierusalem for this their trespasse .
Yet hee sent prophets to them to bring them againe vnto the Lord , and they testified against them : but they would not giue eare .
And the spirit of God came vpon Zechariah the sonne of Iehoiada the priest , which stood aboue the people , and said vnto them : Thus saith God , Why transgresse yee the commandements of the Lord , that yee cannot prosper ? Because yee haue forsaken the Lord , he hath also forsaken you .
And they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandement of the king , in the court of the house of the Lord .
Thus Ioash the king remembred not the kindnesse which Iehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his sonne : and when he died , he said , The Lord looke vpon it , and require it .
¶ And it came to passe at the end of the yeere , that the hoste of Syria came vp against him : and they came to Iudah and Ierusalem , and destroyed all the Princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoile of them vnto the king of Damascus .
For the armie of the Syrians came with a small companie of men , and the Lord deliuered a very great hoste into their hand , because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers : so they executed iudgement against Ioash .
And when they were departed from him ( for they left him in great diseases ) his owne seruants conspired against him , for the blood of the sonnes of Iehoiada the Priest , and slewe him on his bed , and he died : and they buried him in the citie of Dauid , but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the Kings .
And these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the sonne of Shimeah an Ammonitesse , and Iehozabad the sonne of Shimrith a Moabitesse .

Amaziah was twentie and fiue yeeres olde when hee began to reigne , and hee reigned twentie and nine yeeres in Ierusalem , and his mothers name was Iehoadan of Ierusalem .
And hee did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , but not with a perfite heart .
¶ Now it came to passe when the kingdome was established to him , that he slew his seruants , that had killed the king his father .
But hee slewe not their children , but did as it is written in the Law in the booke of Moses , where the Lord commanded , saying , The fathers shall not die for the children , neither shall the children die for the fathers ; but euery man shall die for his owne sinne .
¶ Moreouer , Amaziah gathered Iudah together , and made them Captaines ouer thousands , and captaines ouer hundreds , according to the houses of their fathers , throughout all Iudah and Beniamin : And he numbred them from twentie yeeres olde and aboue , and found them three hundred thousand choice men , able to goe foorth to warre , that could handle speare and shield .
Hee hired also an hundred thousand mightie men of valour , out of Israel , for an hundred talents of siluer .
But there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the armie of Israel goe with thee : for the Lord is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
But if thou wilt goe , doe it , bee strong for the battell : God shall make thee fall before the enemy : for God hath power to helpe , and to cast downe .
And Amaziah said to the man of God , But what shall wee doe for the hundred talents which I haue giuen to the armie of Israel ? And the man of God answered , The Lord is able to giue thee much more then this .
Then Amaziah separated them , to wit , the armie that was come to him out of Ephraim , to goe home againe . Wherfore their anger was greatly kindled against Iudah , and they returned home in great anger .
¶ And Amaziah strengthened himselfe , and ledde foorth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the children of Seir , ten thousand .
And other ten thousand left aliue , did the children of Iudah cary away captiue , and brought them vnto the top of the rocke , and cast them downe from the top of the rocke , that they all were broken in pieces .
¶ But the souldiers of the army which Amaziah sent backe , that they should not goe with him to battell , fell vpon the cities of Iudah , from Samaria euen vnto Beth - horon , and smote three thousand of them , and took much spoile .
¶ Now it came to passe , after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that hee brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them vp to be his gods , and bowed down himselfe before them , and burned incense vnto them .
Wherfore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah , and hee sent vnto him a Prophet , which said vnto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliuer their owne people out of thine hand ?
And it came to passe as hee talked with him , that the king said vnto him , Art thou made of the Kings counsell ? forbeare ; why shouldest thou be smitten ? Then the Prophet forbare , and said , I know that God hath determined to destroy thee , because thou hast done this , and hast not hearkened vnto my counsell .
¶ Then Amaziah king of Iudah tooke aduice , and sent to Ioash the sonne of Iehoahaz the sonne of Iehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let vs see one another in the face .
And Ioash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Iudah , saying , The thistle that was in Lebanon , sent to the Cedar that was in Lebanon , saying , Giue thy daughter to my sonne to wife : and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon , and trode downe the thistle .
Thou sayest , Loe , thou hast smitten the Edomites , and thine heart lifteth thee vp to boast . Abide now at home , why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , euen thou , and Iudah with thee ?
But Amaziah would not heare : for it came of God , that he might deliuer them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought after the gods of Edom .
So Ioash the King of Israel went vp , and they saw one another in the face , both hee and Amaziah King of Iudah at Beth - shemesh , which belongeth to Iudah .
And Iudah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled euery man to his tent .
And Ioash the king of Israel tooke Amaziah king of Iudah the son of Ioash , the son of Ioahaz , at Bethshemesh , and brought him to Ierusalem , and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem , from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , foure hundred cubits .
And hee tooke all the gold and the siluer , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed - Edom , and the treasures of the kings house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
¶ And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash King of Iudah liued after the death of Ioash sonne of Iehoahaz king of Israel , fifteene yeeres .
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel ?
¶ Now after the time that Amaziah did turne away from following the Lord , they made a conspiracie against him in Ierusalem , and he fled to Lachish : but they sent to Lachish after him , and slew him there .

Then all the people of Iudah tooke Uzziah , who was sixteene yeeres old , and made him King in the roome of his father Amaziah .
He built Eloth , and restored it to Iudah : after that the King slept with his fathers .
Sixteene yeeres old was Uzziah , when he began to reigne , and he reigned fiftie and two yeeres in Ierusalem : his mothers name also was Iecoliah of Ierusalem .
And hee did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah did .
And hee sought God in the dayes of Zechariah , who had vnderstanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosper .
And hee went foorth and warred against the Philistines , & brake downe the wall of Gath , and the wall of Iabneh , and the wall of Ashdod , and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
And God helped him against the Philistines , and against the Arabians , that dwelt in Gur - baal , and the Mehunims .
And the Ammonites gaue gifts to Uzziah , and his name spread abroad euen to the entring in of Egypt : for hee strengthened himselfe exceedingly .
Moreouer Uzziah built towers in Ierusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
Also he built towers in the desert , and digged many welles , for hee had much cattell , both in the low countrey , and in the plaines : husbandmen also , and vine dressers in the mountaines , and in Carmel : for hee loued husbandrie .
Moreouer , Uzziah had an host of fighting men , that went out to warre by bands , according to the number of their account , by the hand of Ieiel the Scribe , and Maasiah the ruler , vnder the hand of Hananiah , one of the kings captaines . The whole number of the chiefe of the fathers of the mightie men of valour , were two thousand and sixe hundred .
And vnder their hand was an armie , three hundred thousand , and seuen thousand , and fiue hundred , that made warre with mightie power , to helpe the king against the enemie .
And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the hoste , shields , and speares , and helmets , and habergions , and bowes , and slings to cast stones .
And hee made in Ierusalem engines inuented by cunning men , to bee on the towers , & vpon the bulwarks , to shoote arrowes and great stones withall : and his name spread farre abroad , for he was marueilously helped , till he was strong .
¶ But when he was strong , his heart was lifted vp to his destruction : for he transgressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temple of the Lord , to burne incense vpon the altar of incense .
And Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourescore priests of the Lord , that were valiant men .
And they withstood Uzziah the king , and said vnto him , It perteineth not vnto thee , Uzziah , to burne incense vnto the Lord , but to the priestes the sonnes of Aaron , that are consecrated to burne incense . Goe out of the Sanctuarie ; for thou hast trespassed , neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God .
Then Uzziah was wroth , and had a censer in his hand , to burne incense , and while he was wroth with the priests , the leprosie euen rose vp in his forehead , before the priests , in the house of the Lord , from beside the incense altar .
And Azariah the chiefe priest , and all the priests looked vpon him , and behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence , yea himselfe hasted also to goe out , because the Lord had smitten him .
And Uzziah the king was a leper vnto the day of his death , and dwelt in a seuerall house being a leper , for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Iotham his sonne was ouer the kings house , iudging the people of the land .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Uzziah first and last , did Isaiah the prophet the sonne of Amoz write .

Iotham was twenty and fiue yeeres olde , when hee began to reigne , and hee reigned sixteene yeeres in Ierusalem : his mothers name also was Ierushah , the daughter of Zadok .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uzziah did : howbeit hee entred not into the temple of the Lord . And the people did yet corruptly .
He built the high gate of the house of the Lord , and on the wall of Ophel , he built much .
Moreouer hee built cities in the mountaines of Iudah , and in the forrests he built castles and towers .
¶ He fought also with the king of the Ammonites , and preuailed against them . And the children of Ammon gaue him the same yeere an hundred talents of siluer , and ten thousand measures of wheate , and tenne thousand of barley . So much did the children of Ammon pay vnto him , both the second yeere , and the third .
So Iotham became mightie , because he prepared his wayes before the Lord his God .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Iotham and all his warres , and his wayes , lo , they are written in the booke of the Kings of Israel and Iudah .
Hee was fiue and twentie yeeres olde when he began to reigne , and reigned sixteene yeeres in Ierusalem .
<NON-VERSE>
Ahaz was twentie yeeres olde when hee beganne to reigne , and he reigned sixteene yeres in Ierusalem : but hee did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like Dauid his father .
For he walked in the wayes of the Kings of Israel , and made also molten images for Baalim .
Moreouer , he burnt incense in the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , & burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen , whome the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
Hee sacrificed also , and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hils , and vnder euery greene tree .
Wherefore the Lord his God deliuered him into the hand of the king of Syria , and they smote him , and caried away a great multitude of them captiues , and brought them to Damascus : And he was also deliuered into the hand of the king of Israel , who smote him wich a great slaughter .
¶ For Pekah the sonne of Remaliah slew in Iudah an hundred & twentie thousand in one day , which were all valiant men : because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers .
And Zichri a mightie man of Ephraim , slue Maaseiah the kings sonne , and Azrikam the gouernour of the house , and Elkanah that was next to the King .
And the children of Israel caried away captiue of their brethren , two hundred thousand , women , sonnes and daughters , and tooke also away much spoile from them , and brought the spoile to Samaria .
But a Prophet of the Lord was there , whose name was Oded : and hee went out before the hoste that came to Samaria , and said vnto them , Behold , because the Lord God of your fathers was wroth with Iudah , he hath deliuered them into your hand , and yee haue slaine them in a rage that reacheth vp vnto heauen .
And now ye purpose to keepe vnder the children of Iudah and Ierusalem for bondmen , and bondwomen vnto you : But are there not with you , euen with you , sinnes against the Lord your God ?
Now heare me therefore , and deliuer the captiues againe , which ye haue taken captiue of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of God is vpon you .
Then certeine of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the sonne of Iohanan , Berechiah the sonne of Meshillemoth , and Iehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the sonne of Hadlai , stood vp against them that came from the warre ,
And said vnto them , Ye shall not bring in the captiues hither : for whereas wee haue offended against the Lord already , ye intend to adde more to our sinnes and to our trespasse : for our trespasse is great , and there is fierce wrath against Israel .
So the armed men left the captiues , and the spoile before the Princes , and all the congregation .
And the men which were expressed by name , rose vp and tooke the captiues , and with the spoile clothed all that were naked among them , and arayed them , and shod them , and gaue them to eate and to drinke , and anointed them , and caried all the feeble of them vpon asses , and brought them to Iericho , the city of palme - trees , to their brethren : then they returned to Samaria .
¶ At that time did king Ahaz send vnto the kings of Assyria to helpe him .
For againe the Edomites had come and smitten Iudah , and caried away captiues .
The Philistines also had inuaded the cities of the low - countrey , and of the South of Iudah , and had taken Beth - shemesh , and Aialon , and Gedetoth , and Shocho with the villages thereof , and Timnah with the villages thereof , Gimzo also , and the villages thereof : and they dwelt there .
For the Lord brought Iudah low , because of Ahaz king of Israel ; for he made Iudah naked , and transgressed sore against the Lord .
And Tilgath - Pilneser king of Assyria came vnto him , and distressed him , but strengthened him not .
For Ahaz tooke away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the King , and of the Princes , and gaue it vnto the King of Assyria : but he helped him not .
¶ And in the time of this distresse did hee trespasse yet more against the Lord : This is that king Ahaz .
For he sacrificed vnto the gods of Damascus , which smote him : and he said , Because the gods of the kings of Syria helpe them , therefore will I sacrifice to them , that they may helpe me : but they were the ruine of him , and of all Israel .
And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut vp the doores of the house of the Lord , and hee made him altars in euery corner of Ierusalem .
And in euery seuerall city of Iudah hee made high places to burne incense vnto other gods , and prouoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers .
¶ Now the rest of his acts , and of all his wayes , first and last , behold , they are written in the booke of the kings of Iudah and Israel .

Hezekiah began to reigne when hee was fiue and twentie yeeres old , and he reigned nine and twentie yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Abiiah the daughter of Zechariah .
And hee did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Dauid his father had done .
¶ He , in the first yere of his reigne , in the first moneth , opened the doores of the house of the Lord , and repaired them .
And hee brought in the Priests , and the Leuites , and gathered them together into the East street ,
And said vnto them , Heare me , ye Leuites , sanctifie now your selues , and sanctifie the house of the Lord God of your fathers , and cary foorth the filthinesse out of the holy place .
For our fathers haue trespassed , and done that which was euill in the eyes of the Lord our God , and haue forsaken him , and haue turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
Also they haue shut vp the doores of the Porch , and put out the lampes , and haue not burnt incense , nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place , vnto the God of Israel .
Wherfore the wrath of the Lord was vpon Iudah and Ierusalem , and he hath deliuered them to trouble , to astonishment , and to hissing , as yee see with your eyes .
For loe , our fathers haue fallen by the sword , and our sonnes and our daughters , and our wiues , are in captiuitie for this .
Now it is in mine heart to make a couenant with the Lord God of Israel , that his fierce wrath may turne away from vs .
My sonnes , bee not now negligent : for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him , to serue him , and that you should minister vnto him , and burne incense .
¶ Then the Leuites arose , Mahath the sonne of Amashai , and Ioel the sonne of Azariah , of the sonnes of the Kohathites : and of the sonnes of Merari , Kish the sonne of Abdi , and Azariah the sonne of Iahalelel : and of the Gershonites Ioah , the sonne of Zimmah , and Eden the sonne of Ioah :
And of the sonnes of Elizaphan , Shimri , and Iehiel : and of the sonnes of Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah :
And of the sonnes of Heman , Iehiel , and Shimei : and of the sonnes of Ieduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
And they gathered their brethren , and sanctified themselues , and came according to the commandement of the king , by the words of the Lord , to cleanse the house of the Lord .
And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord , to cleanse it , and brought out all the vncleannes that they found in the temple of the Lord , into the court of the house of the Lord . And the Leuites tooke it , to carie it out abroad into the brooke Kidron .
Now they began on the first day of the first moneth to sanctifie , and on the eight day of the moneth , came they to the porch of the Lord . So they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight dayes , and in the sixteenth day of the first moneth , they made an end .
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king , and said , We haue cleansed all the house of the Lord , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the shew - bread table , with all the vessels thereof .
Moreouer all the vessels which king Ahaz in his reigne did cast away in his transgression , haue we prepared and sanctified , and behold , they are before the altar of the Lord .
¶ Then Hezekiah the king rose earely , and gathered the rulers of the citie , and went vp to the house of the Lord .
And they brought seuen bullocks and seuen rammes , and seuen lambes , and seuen hee goats for a sinne offring for the kingdome , and for the Sanctuarie , and for Iudah : and he commaunded the priests the sonnes of Aaron to offer them on the Altar of the Lord .
So they killed the bullockes , and the priestes receiued the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : like wise when they had killed the rams , they sprinkled the blood vpon the altar : they killed also the lambes , and they sprinkled the blood vpon the altar .
And they brought foorth the hee goats for the sinne offering , before the king and the congregation , and laide their hands vpon them :
And the priests killed them , and they made reconciliation with their blood vpon the altar , to make an atonement for all Israel : for the king commanded that the burnt offring and the sin offering should be made for all Israel .
And hee set the Leuites in the house of the Lord with cymbals , with psalteries , and with harpes , according to the commandement of Dauid , and of Gad the kings Seer , and Nathan the prophet : for so was the commandement of the Lord by his prophets .
And the Leuites stood with the instruments of Dauid , and the priestes with the trumpets .
And Hezekiah commaunded to offer the burnt offering vpon the altar : and when the burnt offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordeined by Dauid king of Israel .
And all the congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and the trumpetters sounded : and all this continued vntill the burnt offering was finished .
And when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him , bowed themselues and worshipped .
Moreouer Hezekiah the king and the Princes , commanded the Leuites to sing praise vnto the Lord , with the words of Dauid , and of Asaph the Seer : and they sang praises with gladnes , and they bowed their heads and worshipped .
Then Hezekiah answered and said , Now ye haue consecrated your selues vnto the Lord : come neere and bring sacrifices , and thanke - offerings into the house of the Lord . And the congregation brought in sacrifices , and thank - offrings , and as many as were of a free heart , burnt offerings .
And the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought , was threescore and ten bullockes , an hundred rammes , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offring to the Lord .
And the consecrated things were , sixe hundred oxen , and three thousand sheepe .
But the Priests were too few , so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings : wherefore their brethren the Leuites did helpe them , till the worke was ended , and vntill the other Priestes had sanctified themselues : for the Leuites were more vpright in heart , to sanctifie themselues , then the Priests .
And also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , & the drinke offrings , for euery burnt offering . So the seruice of the house of the Lord was set in order .

And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Iudah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Ierusalem , to keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord God of Israel .
For the king had taken counsell , and his Princes , and all the congregation in Ierusalem , to keepe the Passeouer in the second moneth .
For they could not keepe it at that time , because the Priests had not sanctified themselues sufficiently , neither had the people gathered themselues together to Ierusalem .
And the thing pleased the king , and all the Congregation .
So they established a decree , to make proclamation throughout all Israel , from Beersheba euen to Dan , that they should come to keep the Passeouer vnto the Lord God of Israel at Ierusalem : for they had not done it of a long time in such sort , as it was written .
So the Postes went with the letters from the King and his Princes , throughout all Israel and Iudah , and according to the commandement of the king , saying ; Yee children of Israel , turne againe vnto the Lord God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , and hee wil returne to the remnant of you , that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria .
And be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers , who therefore gaue them vp to desolation , as ye see .
Now be yee not stiffe - necked as your fathers were , but yeeld your selues vnto the Lord , and enter into his Sanctuarie , which he hath sanctified for euer : and serue the Lord your God , that the fiercenesse of his wrath may turne away from you .
For if yee turne againe vnto the Lord , your brethren and your children shall finde compassion before them that leade them captiue , so that they shall come againe into this land : for the Lord your God is gracious and mercifull , and will not turne away his face from you , if ye returne vnto him .
So the Posts passed from citie to citie , through the countrey of Ephraim and Manasseh , euen vnto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorne , and mocked them .
Neuerthelesse , diuers of Asher , and Manasseh , and of Zebulun , humbled themselues , and came to Ierusalem .
Also in Iudah , the hand of God was to giue them one heart to doe the commandement of the king and of the Princes , by the word of the Lord .
¶ And there assembled at Ierusalem much people , to keepe the feast of vnleauened bread in the second moneth , a very great congregation .
And they arose and tooke away the altars that were in Ierusalem , and all the altars for incense tooke they away , and cast them into the brooke Kidron .
Then they killed the Passeouer on the fourteenth day of the second moneth : and the Priests and the Leuites were ashamed , and sanctified themselues , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
And they stood in their place after their maner , according to the Law of Moses the man of God : The priests sprinckled the blood , which they receiued of the hand of the Leuites .
For there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the Leuites had the charge of the killing of the Passeouers for euery one that was not cleane , to sanctifie them vnto the Lord .
For a multitude of the people , euen many of Ephraim and Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselues : yet did they eate the Passeouer otherwise then it was written . But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying ; The good Lord pardon euery one ,
That prepareth his heart to seeke God , the Lord God of his fathers , though hee be not cleansed according to the purification of the Sanctuary .
And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people .
And the children of Israel that were present at Ierusalem , kept the feast of vnleauened bread seuen dayes with great gladnesse : and the Leuites and the Priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with lowd instruments vnto the Lord .
And Hezekiah spake comfortably vnto all the Leuites , that taught the good knowledge of the Lord : and they did eate throughout the feast , seuen dayes , offering peace - offerings , and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers .
And the whole assembly tooke counsel to keepe other seuen dayes : and they kept other seuen dayes with gladnesse .
For Hezekiah king of Iudah did giue to the Congregation , a thousand bullockes , and seuen thousand sheep : and the Princes gaue to the Congregation a thousand bullocks , and ten thousand sheepe , and a great number of Priests sanctified themselues .
And all the Congregation of Iudah , with the Priests and the Leuites , and all the Congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Iudah , reioyced .
So there was great ioy in Ierusalem : for since the time of Solomon the sonne of Dauid King of Israel , there was not the like in Ierusalem .
<NON-VERSE>
Now when all this was finished , all Israel that were present , went out to the cities of Iudah , and brake the images in pieces , and cut downe the groues , and threw downe the high places and the altars out of all Iudah and Beniamin , in Ephraim also and Manasseh , vntill they had vtterly destroyed them all . Then all the children of Israel returned euery man to his possession into their owne cities .
¶ And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the Priests and the Leuites after their courses , euery man according to his seruice , the Priests and Leuites for burnt offerings , and for peace offerings , to minister and to giue thankes , and to praise in the gates of the tents of the Lord .
He appointed also the kings portion of his substance , for the burnt offrings , to wit , for the morning and euening burnt offrings ; and the burnt offrings for the Sabbaths , and for the Newmoones , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the Law of the Lord .
Moreouer , he commaunded the people that dwelt in Ierusalem , to giue the portion of the Priests , and the Leuites , that they might be incouraged in the Law of the Lord .
¶ And assoone as the commaundement came abroad , the children of Israel brought in abundance the first fruits of corne , wine and oile , & hony , and of all the increase of the field , and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly .
And concerning the children of Israel and Iudah , that dwelt in the cities of Iudah , they also brought in the tithes of oxen and sheepe , and the tithe of holy things , which were consecrated vnto the Lord their God , and layd them by heapes .
In the third moneth they began to lay the foundation of the heapes , and finished them in the seuenth moneth .
And when Hezekiah and the princes came , and saw the heapes , they blessed the Lord , and his people Israel .
Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Leuites concerning the heapes .
And Azariah the chiefe priest of the house of Zadok , answered him & said : Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord , wee haue had enough to eate , and haue left plentie : for the Lord hath blessed his people ; and that which is left , is this great store .
¶ Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord , and they prepared them , And brought in the offerings and the tithes , and the dedicate things , faithfully : ouer which Cononiah the Leuite was ruler , and Shimei his brother was the next .
And Iehiel , and Azaziah , and Nahath , and Asahel , and Ierimoth , and Iozabad , and Eliel , and Ismachiah , and Mahath , and Benaiah were ouerseers vnder the hande of Cononiah , and Shimei his brother , at the commandement of Hezekiah the king , and Azariah the ruler of the house of God .
And Kore the sonne of Immah the Leuite the porter toward the East , was ouer the free will offerings of God , to distribute the oblations of the Lord , and the most holy things .
And next him were Eden , and Miniamin , and Ieshua , and Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shechaniah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to giue to their brethren by courses , as wel to the great as to the small : Beside their genealogie of males , from three yeeres old and vpward , euen vnto euery one that entreth into the house of the Lord , his dayly portion for their seruice in their charges , according to their courses :
Both to the genealogie of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the Leuites from twenty yeeres olde and vpward , in their charges by their courses :
And to the genealogie of all their litle ones , their wiues , and their sonnes , and their daughters , through all the congregation : for in their set office they sanctified themselues in holinesse .
Also of the sonnes of Aaron the priests , which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities , in euery seuerall citie , the men that were expressed by name , to giue portions to all the males among the priests , and to all that were reckoned by genealogies , among the Leuites .
¶ And thus did Hezekiah throughout al Iudah , and wrought that which was good and right , and trueth before the Lord his God .

After these things and the establishment therof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entred into Iudah , & encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to winne them for himselfe .
And when Hezekiah sawe that Sennacherib was come , and that hee was purposed to fight against Ierusalem ,
He tooke counsel with his princes , and his mightie men , to stop the waters of the fountaines , which were without the citie : and they did helpe him .
So there was gathered much people together , who stopt all the fountaines , and the brooke that ranne through the midst of the land , saying , Why should the kings of Assyria come , and finde much water ?
Also he strengthened himselfe , and built vp all the wall that was broken , and raised it vp to the towers , and another wall without , and prepared Millo in the citie of Dauid , and made darts and shields in abundance .
And hee set captaines of warre ouer the people , and gathered them together to him in the streete of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ;
Be strong and couragious , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there bee moe with vs , then with him .
With him is an arme of flesh , but with vs is the Lord our God to helpe vs , and to fight our battels . And the people rested themselues vpon the words of Hezekiah king of Iudah .
¶ After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his seruants to Ierusalem ( but he himselfe laide siege against Lachish , and all his power with him ) vnto Hezekiah king of Iudah , and vnto all Iudah that were at Ierusalem , saying ;
Thus sayth Semacherib king of Assyria , Whereon doe ye trust , that yee abide in the siege in Ierusalem ?
Doeth not Hezekiah perswade you to giue ouer your selues to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The Lord our God shall deliuer vs out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places , and his altars , and commanded Iudah and Ierusalem , saying ; Yee shall worship before one altar , & burne incense vpon it ? Know ye not what I and my fathers haue done vnto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those landes any wayes able to deliuer their lands out of mine hand ?
Who was there among all the gods of those nations , that my fathers vtterly destroyed , that could deliuer his people out of mine hand , that your God should bee able to deliuer you out of mine hand ?
Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceiue you , nor perswade you on this manner , neither yet beleeue him : for no god of any nation or kingdome was able to deliuer his people out of mine hand , & out of the hand of my fathers : how much lesse shall your God deliuer you out of mine hand ?
And his seruants spake yet more against the Lord God , and against his seruant Hezekiah .
Hee wrote also letters to raile on the Lord God of Israel , & to speake against him , saying , As the gods of the nations of other lands haue not deliuered their people out of mine hand : so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliuer his people out of mine hand .
Then they cryed with a loude voice in the Iewes speech vnto the people of Ierusalem that were on the wal , to affright them , and to trouble them , that they might take the city .
And they spake against the God of Ierusalem , as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the worke of the hands of man .
For this cause Hezekiah the king , and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne of Amoz , prayed and cryed to heauen .
¶ And the Lord sent an Angel , which cut off all the mightie men of valour , and the leaders and captains in the campe of the king of Assyria : so hee returned with shame of face to his owne land . And when hee was come into the house of his god , they that came foorth of his owne bowels , slew him there with the sword .
Thus the Lord saued Hezekiah , and the inhabitants of Ierusalem , from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all other , and guided them on euery side .
And many brought gifts vnto the Lord to Ierusalem , and presents to Hezekiah king of Iudah : so that hee was magnified in the sight of all nations , from thenceforth .
¶ In those dayes Hezekiah was sicke to the death , and prayed vnto the Lord : and he spake vnto him , and he gaue him a signe .
But Hezekiah rendred not againe , according to the benefit done vnto him : for his heart was lifted vp , therefore there was wrath vpon him , and vpon Iudah and Ierusalem .
Notwithstanding , Hezekiah humbled himselfe for the pride of his heart , ( both hee and the inhabitants of Ierusalem ) so that the wrath of the Lord came not vpon them in the dayes of Hezekiah .
¶ And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches , and honour : and he made himselfe treasuries for siluer , and for golde , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all maner of pleasant iewels ;
Store - houses also for the increase of corne , and wine and oile ; and stalles for all maner of beasts , and coates for flocks .
Moreouer , hee prouided him cities , and possessions of flockes & heards in abundance : for God had giuen him substance very much .
This same Hezekiah also stopped the vpper water - course of Gihon , and brought it straight downe to the Westside of the City of Dauid . And Hezekiah prospered in all his workes .
¶ Howbeit , in the businesse of the Embassadours of the Princes of Babylon , who sent vnto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
¶ Now , the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his goodnesse , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the Prophet , the sonne of Amoz , and in the booke of the kings of Iudah and Israel .

Manasseh was twelue yeeres old when he began to reigne , and he reigned fiftie and fiue yeres in Ierusalem :
But did that which was euil in the sight of the Lord , like vnto the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
¶ For hee built againe the high places , which Hezekiah his father had broken downe , and he reared vp altars for Baalim , and made groues , and worshipped all the host of heauen , and serued them .
Also hee built altars in the house of the Lord , whereof the Lord had saide , In Ierusalem shall my Name be for euer .
And he built altars for all the host of heauen , in the two Courts of the house of the Lord .
And he caused his children to passe through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom : also he obserued times , and vsed inchantments , and vsed witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with wizards : he wrought much euill in the sight of the Lord , to prouoke him to anger .
And hee set a carued image ( the idole which he had made ) in the house of God , of which God had said to Dauid , and to Solomon his sonne : In this house , and in Ierusalem which I haue chosen before all the tribes of Israel , will I put my Name for euer .
Neither will I any more remoue the foot of Israel from out of the land which I haue appointed for your fathers ; so that they will take heed to doe all that I haue commanded them , according to the whole Law , and the statutes , and the ordinances by the hand of Moses .
So Manasseh made Iudah , and the inhabitants of Ierusalem to erre , and to doe worse then the heathen , whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel .
And the Lord spake to Manasseh , and to his people : but they would not hearken .
¶ Wherfore the Lord brought vpon them the captaines of the host of the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thornes , & bound him with setters , & caried him to Babylon .
And when hee was in affliction , he besought the Lord his God , and humbled himselfe greatly before the God of his fathers ,
And prayed vnto him , and he was intreated of him , and heard his supplication , and brought him againe to Ierusalem into his kingdome . Then Manasseh knew that the Lord hee was God .
Now after this , hee built a wall without the citie of Dauid , on the Westside of Gihon , in the valley , euen to the entring in at the fish - gate , and compassed about Ophel , and raised it vp a very great height , and put captaines of warre in all the fenced cities of Iudah .
And hee tooke away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Ierusalem , and cast them out of the citie .
And hee repaired the altar of the Lord , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings , and thanke offerings , and commaunded Iudah to serue the Lord God of Israel .
Neuerthelesse , the people did sacrifice still in the high places , yet vnto the Lord their God only .
¶ Nowe the rest of the actes of Manasseh , & his prayer vnto his God , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , behold , they are written in the booke of the kings of Israel :
His prayer also , and how God was intreated of him , and all his sinne , and his trespasse , and the places wherein he built high places , and set vp groues and grauen images before hee was humbled : behold , they are written among the sayings of the Seers .
¶ So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his owne house : and Amon his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ Amon was two and twentie yeeres old , when he beganne to reigne , and reigned two yeares in Ierusalem .
But he did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed vnto all the carued images , which Manasseh his father had made , and serued them ;
And humbled not himselfe before the Lord , as Manasseh his father had humbled himselfe : but Amon trespassed more and more .
And his seruants conspired against him , and slew him in his owne house .

Iosiah was eight yeeres old when hee beganne to reigne , and he reigned in Ierusalem one and thirty yeeres .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the wayes of Dauid his father , and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left .
¶ For in the eight yeare of his reigne , while he was yet young , hee beganne to seeke after the God of Dauid his father : and in the twelfth yeere hee beganne to purge Iudah and Ierusalem from the high places and the groues , and the carued images , and the molten images .
And they brake downe the altars of Baalim in his presence , and the images that were on high aboue them , he cut downe , and the groues , and the carued images , and the molten images he brake in peeces , and made dust of them , and strowed it vpon the graues of them , that had sacrificed vnto them .
And hee burnt the bones of the priests vpon their altars , and cleansed Iudah and Ierusalem .
And so did he in the cities of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and Simeon , euen vnto Naphtali , with their mattockes , round about .
And when he had broken downe the altars and the groues , and had beaten the grauen images into pouder , and cut downe all the idoles throughout all the land of Israel , hee returned to Ierusalem .
¶ Now in the eighteenth yeere of his reigne , when hee had purged the land , and the house ; he sent Shaphan the sonne of Azaliah , and Maasiah the gouernour of the citie , and Ioah the sonne of Ioahaz the recorder , to repaire the house of the Lord his God .
And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest , they deliuered the money that was brought into the house of God , which the Leuites that kept the doores , had gathered of the hand of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and of all the remnant of Israel , and of all Iudah , and Beniamin , and they returned to Ierusalem .
And they put it in the hand of the workemen that had the ouersight of the house of the Lord , and they gaue it to the workemen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repaire and mend the house .
Euen to the artificers and builders gaue they it , to buy hewen stone , and timber for couplings , and to floore the houses , which the kings of Iudah had destroyed .
And the men did the worke faithfully , and the ouerseers of them were Iahath , and Obadiah , the Leuites , of the sonnes of Merari , and Sechariah , and Meshullam , of the sonnes of the Kohathites , to set it forward : and other of the Leuites , all that could skill of instruments of musicke .
Also they were ouer the bearers of burdens , and were ouerseers of all that wrought the worke in any manner of seruice : and of the Leuites there were Scribes , and officers , and porters .
¶ And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a booke of the lawe of the Lord , giuen by Moses .
And Hilkiah answered and saide to Shaphan the scribe : I haue found the booke of the law in the house of the Lord . And Hilkiah deliuered the booke to Shaphan :
And Shaphan caried the booke to the king , and brought the king word backe againe , saying , All that was committed to thy seruants , they doe it .
And they haue gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and haue deliuered it into the hand of the ouerseers , and to the hand of the workemen .
Then Shaphan the scribe tolde the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath giuen me a booke . And Shaphan read it before the king .
And it came to passe when the king had heard the words of the lawe , that he rent his clothes .
And the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan , and Abdon the sonne of Mirah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a seruant of the kings , saying ,
Goe , enquire of the Lord for me , and for them that are left in Israel and in Iudah , concerning the wordes of the booke that is found : for great is the wrath of the Lord that is powred out vpon vs , because our fathers haue not kept the word of the Lord , to doe after all that is written in this booke .
And Hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetesse , the wife of Shallum the sonne of Tikuath , the sonne of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she dwelt in Ierusalem in the colledge , ) and they spake to her to that effect .
¶ And she answered them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Tell ye the man that sent you to me ,
Thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring euill vpon this place , and vpon the inhabitants thereof , euen all the curses that are written in the booke which they haue read before the king of Iudah :
Because they haue forsaken mee , and haue burned incense vnto other gods , that they might prouoke mee to anger with all the workes of their hands , therefore my wrath shall bee powred out vpon this place , and shall not be quenched . And as for the king of Iudah , who sent you to enquire of the Lord , so shal ye say vnto him : Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , concerning the words which thou hast heard :
Because thine heart was tender , and thou didst humble thy selfe before God , when thou heardest his words against this place , and against the inhabitants thereof , and humbledst thy selfe before me , and diddest rend thy clothes , and weepe before me , I haue euen heard thee also , saith the Lord .
Behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt bee gathered to thy graue in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the euill that I will bring vpon this place , and vpon the inhabitants of the same . So they brought the king word againe .
¶ Then the king sent , and gathered together all the Elders of Iudah and Ierusalem .
And the king went vp into the house of the Lord , and all the men of Iudah , and the inhabitants of Ierusalem , and the priests and the Leuites , and all the people great and small : and he read in their eares all the words of the booke of the couenant , that was found in the house of the Lord .
And the King stood in his place , & made a Couenant before the Lord , to walke after the Lord , and to keep his Commandements , and his Testimonies , and his Statutes , with all his heart , & with all his soule , to performe the words of the Couenant which are written in this booke .
And he caused all that were present in Ierusalem and Beniamin , to stand to it . And the inhabitants of Ierusalem did according to the couenant of God , the God of their fathers .

Moreouer Iosiah kept a Passeouer vnto the Lord in Ierusalem : and they killed the Passeouer on the fourteenth day of the first moneth .
And hee set the Priestes in their charges , and encouraged them to the seruice of the house of the Lord ,
And said vnto the Leuites , that taught all Israel , which were holy vnto the Lord , Put the holy Arke in the house , which Solomon the sonne of Dauid king of Israel did build ; it shall not be a burden vpon your shoulders : serue now the Lord your God , and his people Israel .
And prepare your selues by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of Dauid king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his sonne .
And stand in the holy place according to the diuisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the diuision of the families of the Leuites .
So kill the Passeouer , and sanctifie your selues , and prepare your brethren , that they may doe according to the word of the Lord , by the hand of Moses .
And Iosiah gaue to the people , of the flocke , lambes and kiddes , all for the Passeouer - offerings , for all that were present , to the number of thirtie thousand , and three thousand bullocks : these were of the kings substance .
And his Princes gaue willingly vnto the people , to the Priests and to the Leuites : Hilkiah , and Zachariah , and Iehiel , rulers of the house of God , gaue vnto the Priests for the Passeouer - offerings , two thousand and sixe hundred small cattell , and three hundred oxen .
Conaniah also , and Shemaiah , and Nethaneel , his brethren , & Hashabiah , and Iehiel , and Ioshabad chiefe of the Leuites , gaue vnto the Leuites for Passeouer - offerings , fiue thousand small cattell , and fiue hundred oxen .
So the seruice was prepared , and the Priests stood in their place , and the Leuites in their courses , according to the kings commandement .
And they killed the Passeouer , and the Priestes sprinckled the blood from their handes , and the Leuites flayed them .
And they remooued the burnt offerings , that they might giue according to the diuisions of the families of the people , to offer vnto the Lord , as it is written in the booke of Moses : and so did they with the oxen .
And they rosted the Passeouer with fire , according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in cauldrons , and in pannes , and diuided them speedily among all the people .
And afterward they made ready for themselues , and for the Priests : because the Priests the sonnes of Aaron were busied in offring of burnt offrings , and the fat vntill night : therefore the Leuites prepared for themselues , and for the Priests the sonnes of Aaron .
And the singers the sonnes of Asaph , were in their place according to the commandement of Dauid , and Asaph , and Heman , and Ieduthun the kings Seer : and the Porters waited at euery gate : they might not depart from their seruice ; for their brethren the Leuites prepared for them .
So all the seruice of the Lord was prepared the same day , to keepe the Passeouer , and to offer burnt offerings vpon the altar of the Lord , according to the commaundement of king Iosiah .
And the children of Israel that were present , kept the Passeouer at that time , and the feast of vnleauened bread seuen dayes .
And there was no Passeouer like to that , kept in Israel , from the dayes of Samuel the Prophet : neither did all the Kings of Israel keepe such a Passeouer , as Iosiah kept , and the Priests and the Leuites , and all Iudah and Israel that were present , and the inhabitants of Ierusalem .
In the eighteenth yeere of the reigne of Iosiah , was this Passeouer kept .
¶ After all this , when Iosiah had prepared the Temple , Necho king of Egypt came vp to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates : and Iosiah went out against him .
But hee sent Embassadours to him , saying , What haue I to doe with thee , thou king of Iudah ? I come not against thee this day , but against the house , wherewith I haue warre : for God commaunded mee to make haste : forbeare thee from medling with God , who is with mee , that hee destroy thee not .
Neuerthelesse Iosiah would not turne his face from him , but disguised himselfe that he might fight with him , and hearkened not vnto the wordes of Necho from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo .
And the archers shot at king Iosiah : and the King saide to his seruants , Haue mee away , for I am sore wounded .
His seruants therefore tooke him out of that charet , and put him in the second charet that hee had : and they brought him to Ierusalem , and hee died , and was buried in one of the Sepulchres of his fathers . And all Iudah and Ierusalem mourned for Iosiah .
¶ And Ieremiah lamented for Iosiah , and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Iosiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in Israel ; and beholde , they are written in the Lamentations .
Now the rest of the acts of Iosiah , and his goodnes , according to that which was written in the Law of the Lord ,

Then the people of the land tooke Iehoahaz the son of Iosiah , and made him King in his fathers stead in Ierusalem .
Iehoahaz was twentie and three yeeres old , when hee began to reigne , and hee reigned three moneths in Ierusalem .
And the king of Egypt put him downe at Ierusalem , and condemned the land in an hundred talents of siluer , and a talent of gold .
And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother , king ouer Iudah and Ierusalem , and turned his name to Iehoiakim . And Necho tooke Iehoahaz his brother , and caried him to Egypt .
¶ Iehoiakim was twentie and fiue yeres old when he began to reigne , and he reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem : and hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord his God .
Against him came vp Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon , and bound him in fetters to cary him to Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar also caried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
Now the rest of the acts of Iehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the booke of the Kings of Israel and Iudah : and Iehoiachin his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ Iehoiachin was eight yeeres old when hee began to reigne , and hee reigned three moneths and ten dayes in Ierusalem , and hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord .
And when the yeere was expired , King Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother , king ouer Iudah and Ierusalem .
¶ Zedekiah was one and twentie yeres old , when he began to reigne , and reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem .
And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord his God , and humbled not himselfe before Ieremiah the Prophet , speaking from the mouth of the Lord .
And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him sweare by God : but he stiffened his necke , and hardened his heart from turning vnto the Lord God of Israel .
¶ Moreouer all the chiefe of the priests , and the people transgressed very much , after all the abominations of the heathen , and polluted the house of the Lord which hee had hallowed in Ierusalem .
And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising vp betimes , and sending : because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
But they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his wordes , and misused his prophets , vntill the wrath of the Lord arose against his people , till there was no remedie .
Therefore hee brought vpon them the king of the Caldees , who slew their yong men with the sword , in the house of their sanctuarie , and had no compassion vpon yong man or maiden , olde man , or him that stouped for age : he gaue them all into his hand .
And all the vessels of the house of God great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes : all these he brought to Babylon .
And they burnt the house of God , and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem , and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof .
And them that had escaped from the sword , caried he away to Babylon : where they were seruants to him and his sonnes , vntil the reigne of the kingdome of Persia :
To fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Ieremiah , vntill the land had enioyed her Sabbaths : for as long as shee lay desolate , shee kept Sabbath , to fulfill threescore and tenne yeeres .
¶ Now in the first yeere of Cyrus king of Persia ( that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Ieremiah , might bee accomplished ) the Lord stirred vp the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that hee made a proclamation throughout all his kingdome , and put it also in writing , saying ,
<NON-VERSE>
Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothie our brother , vnto the Church of God , which is at Corinth , with all the Saints , which are in all Achaia :
Grace bee to you and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Iesus Christ .
Blessed be God , euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ,
Who comforteth vs in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort , wherewith we our selues are comforted of God .
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in vs , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and saluation , which is effectuall in the enduring of the same sufferings , which wee also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation , and saluation .
And our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as you are partakers of the sufferings , so shall yee be also of the consolatiou .
For we would not , brethren , haue you ignorant of our trouble which came to vs in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , aboue strength , in so much that we dispaired euen of life .
But we had the sentence of death in our selues , that we should not trust in our selues , but in God which raiseth the dead .
Who deliuered vs from so great a death , and doeth deliuer : in whom we trust that he will yet deliuer vs :
You also helping together by prayer for vs , that for the gift bestowed vpon vs by the meanes of many persons , thankes may bee giuen by many on our behalfe .
For our reioycing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicitie and godly sinceritie , not with fleshly wisedome , but by the grace of God , wee haue had our conuersation in the world , and more aboundantly to youwards .
For we write none other things vnto you , then what you reade or acknowledge , and I trust you shall acknowledge euen to the end .
As also you haue acknowledged vs in part , that we are your reioycing , euen as ye also are ours , in the day of the Lord Iesus .
And in this confidence I was minded to come vnto you before , that you might haue a second benefit :
And to passe by you into Macedonia , and to come againe out of Macedonia vnto you , and of you to bee brought on my way toward Iudea .
When I therefore was thus minded , did I vse lightnesse ? or the things that I purpose , doe I purpose according to the flesh , that with mee there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
But as God is true , our word toward you , was not yea and nay .
For the Sonne of God Iesus Christ , who was preached among you by vs , euen by me , and Syluanus and Timotheus , was not Yea , and Nay , but in him , was yea .
For all the promises of God in him are Yea , and in him Amen , vnto the glory of God by vs .
Now hee which stablisheth vs with you , in Christ , and hath anoynted vs , is God ,
Who hath also sealed vs , and giuen the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
Moreouer , I call God for a record vpon my soule , that to spare you I came not as yet vnto Corinth .
<NON-VERSE>
But I determined this with my selfe , that I would not come againe to you in heauinesse .
For if I make you sorie , who is hee then that maketh mee glad , but the same which is made sorie by me .
And I wrote this same vnto you , least when I came , I should haue sorrow from them of whome I ought to reioyce , hauing confidence in you all , that my ioy is the ioy of you all .
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart , I wrote vnto you with many teares , not that you should bee grieued , but that yee might knowe the loue which I haue more abundantly vnto you .
But if any haue caused griefe , hee hath not grieued mee , but in part : that I may not ouercharge you all .
Wherefore I beseech you , that you would confirme your loue towards him .
For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proofe of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
To whom yee forgiue any thing , I forgiue also : for if I forgaue any thing , to whom I forgaue it , for your sakes forgaue I it , in the person of Christ ,
Lest Satan should get an aduantage of vs : for wee are not ignorant of his deuices .
Furthermore when I came to Troas , to preach Christs Gospel , and a doore was opened vnto mee of the Lord ,
I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother , but taking my leaue of them , I went from thence into Macedonia .
Now thankes bee vnto God , which alwayes causeth vs to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the sauour of his knowledge by vs in euery place .
For wee are vnto God , a sweet sauour of Christ , in them that are saued , and in them that perish .
To the one wee are the sauour of death vnto death ; and to the other , the sauour of life vnto life : and who is sufficient for these things ?
<NON-VERSE>
Doe wee begin againe to commend our selues ? or need wee , as some others , Epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
Ye are our Epistle written in our hearts , knowen and read of all men .
Forasmuch as yee are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred by vs , written not with inke , but with the spirit of the liuing God , not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
And such trust haue wee through Christ to Godward :
Not that wee are sufficient of our selues to thinke any thing as of our selues : but our sufficiencie is of God :
Who also hath made vs able ministers of the New Testament , not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giueth life .
But if the ministration of death written , and ingrauen in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly beholde the face of Moses , for the glory of his countenance , which glorie was to be done away :
How shall not the ministration of the spirit , be rather glorious ?
For if the ministration of condemnation bee glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousnesse exceed in glorie .
For euen that which was made glorious , had no glorie in this respect by reason of the glorie that excelleth .
For if that which is done away , was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
Seeing then that wee haue such hope , we vse great plainnesse of speech .
And not as Moses , which put a vaile ouer his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly looke to the end of that which is abolished ;
But their mindes were blinded : for vntill this day remaineth the same vaile vntaken away , in the reading of the old testament : which vaile is done away in Christ .
But euen vnto this day , when Moses is read , the vaile is vpon their heart .
Neuerthelesse , when it shall turne to the Lord , the vaile shall be taken away .
Now the Lord is that spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is libertie .
<NON-VERSE>
Therefore , seeing we haue this ministery , as we haue receiued mercie wee faint not :
But haue renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftines , nor handling the word of God deceitfully , but by manifestation of the trueth , commending our selues to euery mans conscience , in the sight of God .
But if our Gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost :
In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which beleeue not , lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine vnto them .
For we preach not our selues , but Christ Iesus the Lord , and our selues your seruants for Iesus sake .
For God who commaunded the light to shine out of darkenes , hath shined in our hearts , to giue the light of the knowledge of the glory of God , in the face of Iesus Christ .
But we haue this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellencie of the power may be of God , and not of vs .
Wee are troubled on euery side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despaire ,
Persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast downe , but not destroyed .
Alwayes bearing about in the body , the dying of the Lord Iesus , that the life also of Iesus might bee made manifest in our body .
For we which liue , are always deliuered vnto death for Iesus sake , that the life also of Iesus might bee made manifest in our mortall flesh .
So then death worketh in vs , but life in you .
We hauing the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I beleeued , and therefore haue I spoken : wee also beleeue , and therefore speake .
Knowing that hee which raised vp the Lord Iesus , shall raise vp vs also by Iesus , and shall present vs with you .
For all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might , through the thankesgiuing of many , redound to the glory of God .
<NON-VERSE>
For we know , that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolued , wee haue a building of God , an house not made with hand , eternall in the heauens .
For in this we grone earnestly , desiring to be clothed vpon with our house , which is from heauen .
If so be that being clothed we shal not be found naked .
For , we that are in this tabernacle , doe grone , being burdened , not for that wee would bee vnclothed , but clothed vpon , that mortalitie might bee swallowed vp of life .
Now he that hath wrought vs for the selfe same thing , is God , who also hath giuen vnto vs the earnest of the spirit .
Therefore we are alwayes confident , knowing that whilest wee are at home in the body , wee are absent from the Lord .
( For we walke by faith , not by sight . )
We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
Wherefore we labour , that whether present or absent , we may be accepted of him .
For we must all appeare before the iudgement seat of Christ , that euery one may receiue the things done in his body , according to that hee hath done , whether it be good or bad .
Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord , we perswade men ; but we are made manifest vnto God , & I trust also , are made manifest in your consciences .
For we commend not our selues againe vnto you , but giue you occasion to glory on our behalfe , that you may haue somewhat to answere them , which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
For whether wee bee besides our selues , it is to God : or whether we bee sober , it is for your cause .
For the loue of Christ constreineth vs , because wee thus iudge : that if one died for all , then were all dead :
And that he died for all , that they which liue , should not hencefoorth liue vnto themselues , but vnto him which died for them , and rose againe .
Wherefore hencefoorth know we no man , after the flesh : yea , though we haue knowen Christ after the flesh , yet now hencefoorth knowe wee him no more .
Therfore if any man be in Christ , hee is a new creature : old things are past away , behold , al things are become new .
And all things are of God , who hath reconciled vs to himselfe by Iesus Christ , and hath giuen to vs the ministery of reconciliation ,
To wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world vnto himselfe , not imputing their trespasses vnto them , and hath committed vnto vs the word of reconciliation .
Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by vs ; we pray you in Christs stead , that be ye reconciled to God .
<NON-VERSE>
Wee then , as workers together with him , beseech you also , that ye receiue not the grace of God in vaine .
( For he saith , I haue heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of saluation haue I succoured thee : beholde , now is the accepted time , behold , now is the day of saluation )
Giuing no offence in any thing , that the ministery be not blamed :
But in all things approuing our selues , as the Ministers of God , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ,
By purenesse , by knowledge , by long suffering , by kindnesse , by the holy Ghost , by loue vnfained ,
By the worde of trueth , by the power of God , by the armour of righteousnesse , on the right hand , and on the left ,
By honour and dishonour , by euil report and good report , as deceiuers and yet true :
As vnknowen , & yet wel knowen : as dying , and behold , we liue : as chastened , and not killed :
As sorrowfull , yet alway reioycing : as poore , yet making many rich : as hauing nothing , and yet possessing all things .
O yee Corinthians , our mouth is open vnto you , our heart is enlarged .
Yee are not straitened in vs , but yee are straitned in your owne bowels .
Nowe for a recompense in the same , ( I speake as vnto my children ) be ye also inlarged .
Be ye not vnequally yoked together with vnbeleeuers : for what fellowship hath righteousnesse with vnrighteousnesse ? and what communion hath light with darknesse ?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he that beleeueth , with an infidel ?
And what agreement hath the Temple of God with idoles ? for ye are the Temple of the liuing God , as God hath saide , I will dwell in them , and walke in them , and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
Wherefore come out from among them , and bee yee separate , saieth the Lord , and touch not the vncleane thing , and I will receiue you ,
<NON-VERSE>
Hauing therefore these promises ( dearely beloued ) let vs cleanse our selues from all filthines of the flesh and spirit , perfecting holinesse in the feare of God .
Receiue vs , we haue wronged no man , wee haue corrupted no man , wee haue defrauded no man .
I speake not this to condemne you : for I haue said before , that you are in our hearts to die and liue with you .
Great is my boldnesse of speach toward you , great is my glorying of you , I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding ioyfull in all our tribulation .
For when wee were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on euery side ; without were fightings , within were feares .
Neuerthelesse , God that comforteth those that are cast downe , comforted vs by the comming of Titus .
And not by his comming onely , but by the consolation wherewith hee was comforted in you , when he told vs your earnest desire , your mourning , your feruent minde toward me , so that I reioyced the more .
For though I made you sory with a letter , I doe not repent , though I did repent : For I perceiue that the same Epistle hath made you sory , thogh it were but for a season .
Now I reioyce , not that ye were made sorie , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorie after a godly maner , that ye might receiue damage by vs in nothing .
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to saluation not to be repented of , but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
For behold this selfe same thing that yee sorrowed after a godly sort , what carefulnesse it wrought in you , yea , what clearing of your selues , yea , what indignation , yea what feare , yea what vehement desire , yea what zeale , yea what reuenge ; In all things yee haue approued your selues to be cleare in this matter .
Wherefore though I wrote vnto you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appeare vnto you .
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort , yea and exceedingly the more ioyed wee for the ioy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
For if I haue boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in trueth , euen so our boasting which I made before Titus , is found a trueth .
And his inward affection is more aboundant toward you , whilest he remembreth the obedience of you all , how with feare and trembling you receiued him .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer , brethren , wee do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia ,
How that in a great trial of affliction , the abundance of their ioy , and their deepe pouertie , abounded vnto the riches of their liberalitie .
For to their power ( I beare record ) yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselues :
Praying vs with much entreatie , that we would receiue the gift , and take vpon vs the fellowship of the ministring to the Saints .
And this they did , not as we hoped , but first gaue their owne selues to the Lord , and vnto vs , by the will of God .
In so much that wee desired Titus , that as he had begun , so hee would also finish in you , the same grace also .
Therefore ( as ye abound in euery thing , in faith , and vtterance , & knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your loue to vs ) see that yee abound in this grace also .
I speake not by commandement , but by occasion of the forwardnesse of others , and to prooue the sinceritie of your loue .
Now therefore performe the doing of it , that as there was a readinesse to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which you haue .
For if there bee first a willing minde , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
For I meane not that other men bee eased , and you burthened :
But by an equalitie : that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want , that there may be equalitie ,
As it is written , Hee that had gathered much , had nothing ouer , and hee that had gathered little , had no lacke .
But thankes bee to God which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
For indeed he accepted the exhortation , but being more forward , of his owne accord he went vnto you .
And wee haue sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the Gospel , throughout all the Churches .
And not that onely , but who was also chosen of the Churches to trauaile with vs with this grace which is administred by vs to the glorie of the same Lord , and declaration of your readie minde .
Auoyding this , that no man should blame vs in this aboundance which is administred by vs .
Prouiding for honest things , not onely in the sight of the Lord , but in the sight of men .
And we haue sent with them our brother , whom wee haue often times proued diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , vpon the great confidence which I haue in you .
Whether any doe enquire of Titus ; he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you : or our brethren bee enquired of , they are the messengers of the Churches , and the glorie of Christ .
<NON-VERSE>
For as touching the ministring to the Saints , it is superfluous for mee to write to you .
For I know the forwardnesse of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Achaia was ready a yeere agoe , and your zeale hath prouoked very many .
Yet haue I sent the brethren , least our boasting of you should bee in vaine in this behalfe , that as I saide , yee may be readie .
Lest happily if they of Macedonia come with mee , & find you vnprepared , wee ( that wee say not , you ) should bee ashamed in this same confident boasting .
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before vnto you , and make vp before hand your bountie , whereof yee had notice before , that the same might bee readie , as a matter of bountie , not of couetousnesse .
But this I say , Hee which soweth sparingly , shall reape sparingly : and he which soweth bountifully , shall reape bountifully .
Euerie man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him giue ; not grudgingly , or of necessitie : for God loueth a cheerefull giuer .
And God is able to make all grace abound towards you , that ye alwayes hauing all sufficiencie in all things , may abound to euery good worke ,
( As it is written : Hee hath dispersed abroad : Hee hath giuen to the poore : his righteousnesse remaineth for euer .
Now he that ministreth seede to the sower , both minister bread for your foode , and multiply your seede sowen , and encrease the fruites of your righteousnesse )
Being enriched in euery thing to al bountifulnes , which causeth through vs thankesgiuing to God .
For the administration of this seruice , not onely supplieth the want of the Saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgiuings vnto God ,
Whiles by the experiment of this ministration , they glorifie God for your professed subiection vnto the Gospel of Christ , and for your liberall distribution vnto them , and vnto all men :
And by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
<NON-VERSE>
Now I Paul my selfe beseech you , by the meekenes and gentlenesse of Christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent , am bold toward you :
But I beseech you , that I may not bee bold when I am present , with that confidence wherewith I thinke to be bold against some , which thinke of vs as if wee walked according to the flesh .
For though we walke in the flesh , we doe not warre after the flesh :
( For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling downe of strong holds . )
Casting down imaginations , and euery high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Christ :
And hauing in a readinesse to reuenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
Doe ye looke on things after the outward appearance ? if any man trust to himselfe , that he is Christs , let him of himselfe thinke this againe , that as he is Christs , euen so are we Christs .
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority ( which the Lord hath giuen vs for edification , and not for your destruction ) I should not be ashamed :
That I may not seeme as if I would terrifie you by letters .
For his letters ( say they ) are waighty and powerfull , but his bodily presence is weake , and his speach contemptible .
But we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule , which God hath distributed to vs , a measure to reach euen vnto you .
For we stretch not our selues beyond our measure as though wee reached not vnto you , for wee are come as farre as to you also , in preaching the Gospel of Christ .
Not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other mens labours , but hauing hope , when your faith is increased , that wee shall bee enlarged by you , according to our rule abundantly .
To preach the Gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our hand .
But he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Would to God you could beare with mee a little in my folly , & in deede beare with me .
For I am iealous ouer you with godly iealousie , for I haue espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
But I feare lest by any meanes , as the Serpent beguiled Eue through his subtilty , so your mindes should bee corrupted from the simplicitie that is in Christ .
For if he that commeth preacheth another Iesus whome wee haue not preached , or if yee receiue another spirit , which ye haue not receiued , or another Gospel , which ye haue not accepted , yee might well beare with him .
For , I suppose , I was not a whit behinde the very chiefest Apostles .
But though I be rude in speach , yet not in knowledge ; but we haue bene throughly made manifest among you in all things .
Haue I committed an offence in abasing my selfe , that you might be exalted , because I haue preached to you the Gospel of God freely ?
I robbed other Churches , taking wages of them to doe you seruice .
And when I was present with you , and wanted , I was chargeable to no man : For that which was lacking to mee , the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied , and in all things I haue kept my selfe from being burthensome to you , and so will I keepe my selfe .
As the trueth of Christ is in mee , no man shall stop mee of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
Wherefore ? because I loue you not ? God knoweth .
But what I doe , that I wil doe , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion , that wherein they glory , they may bee found euen as we .
For such are false Apostles , deceitfull workers , transforming themselues into the Apostles of Christ .
And no marueile , for Sathan himselfe is transformed into an Angel of light .
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also bee transformed as the ministers of righteousnesse , whose end shall be according to their workes .
I say againe , Let no man thinke mee a foole ; if otherwise , yet as a foole receiue me , that I may boast my selfe a little . That which I speake , I speake it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting .
Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
For ye suffer fooles gladly , seeing ye your selues are wise . For ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage , if a man deuoure you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himselfe , if a man smite you on the face .
I speake as concerning reproch , as though we had bene weake : howbeit , wherein soeuer any is bold , I speake foolishly , I am bold also .
Are they Hebrewes ? so am I : are they Israelites ? so am I : are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I :
Are they ministers of Christ ? I speake as a foole , I am more : in labors more abundant : in stripes aboue measure : in prisons more frequent : in deaths oft .
Of the Iewes fiue times receiued I forty stripes saue one .
Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned : thrice I suffered shipwracke : a night and a day I haue bene in the deepe . In iourneying often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by my owne countreymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the citie , in perils in the wildernesse , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ,
In wearinesse and painfulnesse , in watchings often , in hunger & thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakednes .
Besides those things that are without , that which commeth vpon me dayly , the care of all the Churches .
Who is weake , and I am not weake ? who is offended , and I burne not ?
If I must needes glory , I will glory of the things which concerne mine infirmities .
The God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ , which is blessed for euermore , knoweth that I lie not .
In Damascus the gouernour vnder Aretas the King , kept the citie with a garison , desirous to apprehend mee .
<NON-VERSE>
It is not expedient for me , doubtlesse , to glory , I wil come to visions and reuelations of the Lord .
I knewe a man in Christ aboue foureteene yeeres agoe , whether in the body , I cannot tell , or whether out of the body , I cannot tell , God knoweth : such a one , caught vp to the third heauen .
And I knew such a man ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I cannot tell , God knoweth . )
How that he was caught vp into Paradise , and heard vnspeakeable wordes , which it is not lawfull for a man to vtter .
Of such a one will I glory , yet of my selfe I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a foole : for I will say the trueth . But now I forbeare , lest any man should thinke of me aboue that which hee seeth me to bee , or that hee heareth of me :
And least I should bee exalted aboue measure through the abundance of the reuelations , there was giuen to me a thorne in the flesh , the messenger of Sathan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted aboue measure .
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from mee .
And he said vnto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weaknes . Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest vpon me .
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christes sake : for when I am weake , then am I strong .
I am become a foole in glorying , ye haue compelled me . For I ought to haue beene commended of you : for in nothing am I behinde the very chiefest Apostles , though I be nothing .
Truely the signes of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signes and wonders , and mightie deeds .
For what is it wherein yee were inferior to other Churches , except it bee that I my selfe was not burthensome to you ? forgiue me this wrong .
Behold , the third time I am readie to come to you , and I will not bee burthensome to you ; for I seeke not yours , but you : for the children ought not to lay vp for the parents , but the parents for the children .
And I wil very gladly spend and bee spent for you , though the more abundantly I loue you , the lesse I bee loued .
But be it so : I did not burthen you : neuerthelesse beeing craftie , I caught you with guile .
Did I make a gaine of you by any of them , whom I sent vnto you ?
I desired Titus , and with him I sent a brother : did Titus make a gaine of you ? Walked wee not in the same spirit ? walked wee not in the same steps ?
Againe , thinke you that we excuse our selues vnto you ? wee speake before God in Christ : but wee doe all things , dearely beloued , for your edifying .
For I feare lest when I come , I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall bee found vnto you such as ye would not , lest there bee debates , enuyings , wraths , strifes , backebitings , whisperings , swellings , tumults ,
<NON-VERSE>
This is the third time I am comming to you : in the mouth of two or three witnesses shal euery word be established .
I told you before , and foretell you as if I were present the second time , and being absent , now I write to them which heretofore haue sinned , and to all other , that if I come againe I will not spare :
Since ye seeke a proofe of Christ , speaking in me , which to you - ward is not weake , but is mightie in you .
For though hee was crucified through weaknesse , yet he liueth by the power of God : for wee also are weake in him , but wee shall liue with him by the power of God toward you .
Examine your selues , whether ye be in the faith : proue your owne selues . Know yee not your owne selues , how that Iesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
But I trust that yee shall knowe that we are not reprobates .
Now I pray to God , that ye doe no euill , not that we should appeare approued , but that ye should doe that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
For wee can doe nothing against the trueth , but for the trueth .
For wee are glad when wee are weake , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , euen your perfection .
Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should vse sharpnesse , according to the power which the Lord hath giuen me to edification , and not to destruction .
Finally , brethren , farewell : Bee perfect , bee of good comfort , bee of one minde , liue in peace , and the God of loue and peace shalbe with you . Greet one another with an holy kisse .
All the Saints salute you .

The Elder vnto the elect Lady , and her children , whome I loue in the trueth : and not I onely , but also all they that haue knowen the trueth :
For the trueths sake which dwelleth in vs , and shalbe with vs for euer :
Grace bee with you , mercie , and peace from God the Father , and from the Lord Iesus Christ , the Sonne of the Father in trueth and loue .
I reioyced greatly , that I found of thy children walking in trueth , as wee haue receiued a commaundement from the Father .
And now , I beseech thee Lady , not as though I wrote a new commandement vnto thee : but that which wee had from the beginning , that wee loue one another .
And this is loue , that wee walke after his Commandements . This is the Commandement , that as yee haue heard from the beginning , yee should walke in it .
For many deceiuers are entred into the world , who confesse not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiuer , and an Antichrist .
Looke to your selues , that wee lose not those things which wee haue wrought , but that we receiue a full reward .
Whosoeuer transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God : hee that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Sonne .
If there come any vnto you , and bring not this doctrine , receiue him not into your house , neither bid him , God speed .
For hee that biddeth him God speed , is partaker of his euill deeds .
Hauing many things to write vnto you , I would not write with paper and inke , but I trust to come vnto you , and speake face to face , that our ioy may be full .

Then Moab rebelled against Israel , after the death of Ahab .
And Ahaziah fel downe thorow a lattesse in his vpper chamber that was in Samaria , and was sicke : and he sent messengers , and said vnto them , Goe , enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron , whether I shal recouer of this disease .
But the Angel of the Lord said to Eliiah the Tishbite , Arise , goe vp to meete the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say vnto them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye goe to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ?
Now therefore , thus sayeth the Lord , Thou shalt not come downe from that bed on which thou art gone vp , but shalt surely die . And Eliiah departed .
¶ And when the messengers turned backe vnto him , he said vnto them , Why are ye now turned backe ?
And they said vnto him , There came a man vp to meet vs , and said vnto vs , Goe , turne againe vnto the king that sent you , and say vnto him , Thus saith the Lord , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ? therefore thou shalt not come downe from that bedde on which thou art gone vp , but shalt surely die .
And hee said vnto them , What maner of man was he which came vp to meet you , and told you these words ?
And they answered him , He was an hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loynes : and he said , It is Eliiah the Tishbite .
Then the King sent vnto him a captaine of fiftie , with his fiftie : and he went vp to him , ( and behold , he sate on the top of an hill ) and hee spake vnto him , Thou man of God , the king hath said , Come downe .
And Eliiah answered , and said to the captaine of fiftie , If I be a man of God , then let fire come downe from heauen , and consume thee and thy fiftie . And there came downe fire from heauen , and consumed him and his fiftie .
Againe also hee sent vnto him another captaine of fiftie , with his fiftie : And hee answered , and said vnto him , O man of God , Thus hath the king said , Come downe quickly .
And Eliiah answered , and saide vnto them , If I be a man of God , let fire come downe from heauen , and consume thee , and thy fiftie . And the fire of God came downe from heauen , and consumed him , and his fiftie .
¶ And hee sent againe a captaine of the third fiftie , with his fiftie : and the third captaine of fiftie went vp , and came and fell on his knees before Eliiah , and besought him , and saide vnto him , Oh man of God , I pray thee , let my life , and the life of these fiftie thy seruants , be precious in thy sight .
Behold , there came fire downe from heauen , and burnt vp the two captaines of the former fifties , with their fifties : Therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
And the Angel of the Lord said vnto Elijah , Goe downe with him , be not afraid of him . And he arose , and went downe with him vnto the king .
And he said vnto him , Thus saith the Lord , Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ( is it not because there is no God in Israel , to enquire of his word ? ) therefore thou shalt not come downe off that bed on which thou art gone vp , but shalt surely die .
¶ So he died , according to the worde of the Lord which Eliiah had spoken : and Iehoram reigned in his stead , in the second yeere of Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah , because he had no sonne .

And it came to passe when the Lord would take vp Elijah into heauen by a whirlewinde , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
And Elijah said vnto Elisha , Tarie here , I pray thee : for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel : and Elisha said vnto him , As the Lord liueth , and as thy soule liueth , I wil not leaue thee . So they went downe to Bethel .
And the sonnes of the Prophets that were at Bethel , came foorth to Elisha , and said vnto him , Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day ? And he said , Yea , I know it , hold you your peace .
And Elijah said vnto him , Elisha , tarie here , I pray thee : for the Lord hath sent me to Iericho : And hee said , As the Lord liueth , and as thy soule liueth , I will not leaue thee . So they came to Iericho .
And the sonnes of the Prophets that were at Iericho came to Elisha , and said vnto him , Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day ? And hee answered , Yea , I knowe it , holde you your peace .
And Elijah said vnto him , Tarie , I pray thee , here : for the Lord hath sent me to Iordan . And he said , As the Lord liueth , and as thy soule liueth , I will not leaue thee . And they two went on .
And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went , and stood to view afarre off : and they two stood by Iordan .
And Elijah tooke his mantle , and wrapt it together , and smote the waters , and they were diuided hither and thither , so that they two went ouer on drie ground .
¶ And it came to passe when they were gone ouer , that Elijah said vnto Elisha , Aske what I shall doe for thee , before I be taken away from thee . And Elisha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be vpon me .
And hee said , Thou hast asked a hard thing : neuerthelesse , if thou see me , when I am taken from thee , it shall be so vnto thee : but if not , it shall not be so .
And it came to passe as they still went on and talked , that beholde , there appeared a charet of fire , and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder , and Elijah went vp by a whirlewind into heauen .
¶ And Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the charet of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . And he saw him no more : and he tooke hold of his owne cloathes , and rent them in two pieces .
He tooke vp also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the banke of Iordan .
And he tooke the mantle of Eliiah that fell from him , and smote the waters , and said , Where is the Lord God of Elijah ? And when hee also had smitten the waters , they parted hither and thither : and Elisha went ouer .
And when the sonnes of the Prophets which were to view at Iericho , saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha : And they came to meet him , and bowed themselues to the ground before him .
¶ And they said vnto him , Behold now , there bee with thy seruants fiftie strong men , let them goe , we pray thee , and seeke thy master : lest peraduenture the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him vp , and cast him vpon some mountaine , or into some valley . And he said , Ye shall not send .
And when they vrged him , till he was ashamed , he said , Send . They sent therefore fiftie men , and they sought three dayes , but found him not .
And when they came againe to him ( for he taried at Iericho ) hee said vnto them , Did I not say vnto you , Goe not ?
¶ And the men of the city said vnto Elisha , Behold , I pray thee , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord seeth : but the water is nought , and the ground barren .
And hee said , Bring mee a new cruse , and put salt therein . And they brought it to him .
And he went forth vnto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Thus saith the Lord , I haue healed these waters ; there shall not be from thence any more death , or barren land .
So the waters were healed vnto this day , according to the saying of Elisha , which he spake .
¶ And he went vp from thence vnto Bethel : and as hee was going vp by the way , there came foorth little children out of the citie , and mocked him , and said vnto him , Goe vp thou bald head , Goe vp thou bald head .
And hee turned backe , and looked on them , and cursed them in the Name of the Lord : and there came foorth two shee Beares out of the wood , and tare fortie and two children of them .

Now Iehoram the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria , the eighteenth yere of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah , and reigned twelue yeeres .
And he wrought euill in the sight of the Lord , but not like his father and like his mother ; for hee put away the image of Baal that his father had made .
Neuerthelesse , hee cleaued vnto the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , which made Israel to sinne ; he departed not therefrom .
¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepe - master , and rendred vnto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambes , and an hundred thousand rammes , with the wooll .
But it came to passe when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
¶ And king Iehoram went out of Samaria the same time , and numbred all Israel .
And he went , and sent to Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah , saying , The king of Moab hath rebelled against mee : Wilt thou goe with mee against Moab to battell ? and he said , I will goe vp : I am as thou art , my people as thy people , and my horses as thy horses .
And he said , Which way shall we goe vp ? And he answered , The way through the wildernesse of Edom .
So the king of Israel went , and the king of Iudah , and the king of Edom : and they fetcht a compasse of seuen dayes iourney : and there was no water for the hoste , and for the cattell that followed them .
And the king of Israel said , Alas , that the Lord hath called these three kings together , to deliuer them into the hand of Moab .
But Iehoshaphat said , Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord , that we may enquire of the Lord by him ? And one of the king of Israels seruants answered , and said , Here is Elisha the sonne of Shaphat , which powred water on the hands of Eliiah .
And Iehoshaphat saide , The word of the Lord is with him . So the king of Israel , & Iehoshaphat , and the king of Edom went downe to him .
And Elisha saide vnto the king of Israel , What haue I to doe with thee ? Get thee to the prophets of thy father , and to the prophets of thy mother . And the king of Israel said vnto him , Nay : for the Lord hath called these three kings together , to deliuer them into the hand of Moab .
And Elisha said , As the Lord of hostes liueth , before whom I stand , Surely were it not that I regard the presence of Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah , I would not looke toward thee , nor see thee .
But now bring me a minstrell . And it came to passe when the minstrell played , that the hand of the Lord came vpon him .
And hee sayde , Thus sayth the Lord , Make this valley full of ditches .
For thus sayth the Lord , Yee shall not see winde , neither shall ye see raine , yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drinke , both ye , and your cattell , and your beasts .
And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord , he will deliuer the Moabites also into your hand .
And ye shall smite euery fenced citie , and euery choice citie , and shall fell euery good tree , and stop all welles of water , and marre euery good piece of land with stones .
And it came to passe in the morning when the meate offering was offered , that behold , there came water by the way of Edom , and the countrey was filled with water .
¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come vp to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on armour , and vpward , and stood in the border .
And they rose vp early in the morning , and the Sunne shone vpon the water , and the Moabites sawe the water on the other side as red as blood .
And they said , This is blood : the kings are surely slaine , and they haue smitten one another : now therefore , Moab , to the spoile .
And when they came to the campe of Israel , the Israelites rose vp and smote the Moabites , so that they fledde before them : but they went forward smiting the Moabites , euen in their countrey .
And they beat downe the cities , and on euery good piece of land cast euery man his stone , and filled it , and they stopped all the welles of water , and felled all the good trees : onely in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof : howbeit the slingers went about it , and smote it .
¶ And when the king of Moab sawe that the battell was too sore for him , he tooke with him seuen hundred men that drewe swordes , to breake thorow euen vnto the king of Edom : but they could not .

Now there cryed a certaine woman of the wiues of the sonnes of the Prophets vnto Elisha , saying , Thy seruant my husband is dead , and thou knowest that thy seruant did feare the Lord : and the creditour is come to take vnto him my two sonnes to be bondmen .
And Elisha said vnto her , What shall I doe for thee ? Tell mee , what hast thou in the house ? And shee sayd , Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house , saue a pot of oyle .
Then hee said , Goe , borrow thee vessels abroad , of all thy neighbours ; euen emptie vessels , borrow not a few .
And when thou art come in , thou shalt shut the doore vpon thee , and vpon thy sonnes , and shalt powre out into all those vessels , and thou shalt set aside that which is full .
So shee went from him , and shut the doore vpon her , & vpon her sonnes : who brought the vessels to her , and shee powred out .
And it came to passe , when the vessels were full , that shee said vnto her sonne , Bring me yet a vessell . And hee said vnto her , There is not a vessel more . And the oyle stayed .
Then she came , and told the man of God : and he said , Goe , sell the oyle , and pay thy debt , and liue thou and thy children of the rest .
¶ And it fell on a day , that Elisha passed to Shunem , where was a great woman ; and shee constrained him to eate bread : And so it was , that as oft as he passed by , hee turned in thither to eate bread .
And shee said vnto her husband , Behold now , I perceiue that this is an holy man of God , which passeth by vs continually .
Let vs make a litle chamber , I pray thee , on the wall , and let vs set for him there a bed , and a table , and a stoole , and a candlesticke : and it shall be when he commeth to vs , that hee shall turne in thither .
And it fell on a day that hee came thither , and hee turned into the chamber , and lay there .
And he said to Gehazi his seruant , Call this Shunammite . And when hee had called her , she stood before him .
And he said vnto him , Say , now vnto her , Behold , thou hast beene carefull for vs with all this care ; What is to be done for thee ? Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king , or to the captaine of the hoste ? And she answered , I dwell among mine owne people .
And he said , What then is to bee done for her ? And Gehazi answered , Uerily she hath no child , and her husband is old .
And he said , Call her . And when he had called her , she stood in the doore .
And he said , About this season , according to the time of life , thou shalt imbrace a sonne . And she said , Nay my lord , thou man of God , doe not lie vnto thine handmaid .
And the woman conceiued , and bare a sonne at that season , that Elisha had said vnto her , according to the time of life .
¶ And when the child was growen , it fell on a day that hee went out to his father , to the reapers .
And he said vnto his father , My head , my head : and he said to a ladde , Carie him to his mother .
And when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , hee sate on her knees till noone , and then died .
And she went vp , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the doore vpon him , and went out .
And she called vnto her husband , and said , Send me , I pray thee , one of the yong men , and one of the asses , that I may runne to the man of God , and come againe .
And he said , Wherefore wilt thou goe to him to day ? it is neither newe moone nor Sabbath . And shee said , It shalbe well .
Then she sadled an asse , and said to her seruant , Driue , and goe forward : slacke not thy riding for mee , except I bid thee .
So she went , and came vnto the man of God to mount Carmel : and it came to passe when the man of God saw her afarre off , that hee said to Gehazi his seruant , Behold , yonder is that Shunammite :
Runne now , I pray thee , to meet her , and say vnto her , Is it wel with thee ? is it wel with thy husband ? is it wel with the child ? And she answered , It is well .
And when shee came to the man of God to the hill , shee caught him by the feet : but Gehazi came neere to thrust her away . And the man of God saide , Let her alone , for her soule is vexed within her : and the Lord hath hid it from me , and hath not told me .
Then shee said , Did I desire a sonne of my Lord ? did I not say , Doe not deceiue me ?
Then he said to Gehazi , Gird vp thy loines , and take my staffe in thine hand , and goe thy way : if thou meete any man , salute him not : and if any salute thee , answere him not againe : and lay my staffe vpon the face of the childe .
And the mother of the childe said , As the Lord liueth , and as thy soule liueth , I will not leaue thee . And he arose , and followed her .
And Gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staffe vpon the face of the child , but there was neither voyce , nor hearing : wherefore he went againe to meete him , and tolde him , saying , The child is not awaked .
And when Elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid vpon his bed .
He went in therefore , and shut the doore vpon them twaine , and prayed vnto the Lord .
And he went vp , and lay vpon the child , and put his mouth vpon his mouth , and his eyes vpon his eyes , and his hands vpon his hands , and he stretched himselfe vpon the child , and the flesh of the child waxed warme .
Then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro , and went vp , and stretched himselfe vpon him : and the child neesed seuen times , and the child opened his eyes .
And hee called Gehazi , and said , Call this Shunammite . So hee called her : and when shee was come in vnto him , he said , Take vp thy sonne .
But he said , Then bring meale . And he cast it into the pot : And he said , Powre out for the people , that they may eat . And there was no harme in the pot .
¶ And there came a man from Baal - Shalisha , and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits , twentie loaues of barley , and full eares of corne in the huske thereof : and he said , Giue vnto the people , that they may eate .
And his seruitour saide , What should I set this before an hundred men ? He said againe , Giue the people , that they may eate : for thus saith the Lord , They shall eate , and shall leaue thereof .

Now Naaman captaine of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the Lord had giuen deliuerance vnto Syria : He was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
And the Syrians had gone out by companies , and had brought away captiue out of the land of Israel a litle maid , & she waited on Naamans wife .
And shee saide vnto her mistresse , Would God my lord were with the Prophet that is in Samaria , for hee would recouer him of his leprosie .
And one went in , and tolde his lord , saying , Thus and thus said the mayd that is of the land of Israel .
And the king of Syria said , Goe to , Goe , and I will send a letter vnto the king of Israel . And hee departed , and tooke with him ten talents of siluer , and sixe thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
And hee brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come vnto thee , behold , I haue therewith sent Naaman my seruant to thee , that thou mayest recouer him of his leprosie .
And it came to passe when the king of Israel had read the letter , that he rent his clothes , and said , Am I God , to kill and to make aliue , that this man doeth send vnto me , to recouer a man of his leprosie ? Wherefore consider , I pray you , and see how he seeketh a quarrell against me .
¶ And it was so when Elisha the man of God had heard , that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? Let him come now to mee , and he shall know that there is a Prophet in Israel .
So Naaman came with his horses , and with his charet , and stood at the doore of the house of Elisha .
And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him , saying , Goe and wash in Iordane seuen times , and thy flesh shall come againe to thee , and thou shalt be cleane .
But Naaman was wroth , and went away , and saide , Beholde , I thought , He will surely come out to me and stand , and call on the Name of the Lord his God , and strike his hand ouer the place , and recouer the leper .
Are not Abana and Pharpar , riuers of Damascus , better then all the waters of Israel ? May I not wash in them , and be cleane ? So he turned , and went away in a rage .
And his seruants came neere and spake vnto him , and said , My father , If the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing , wouldest thou not haue done it ? How much rather then , when hee saith to thee , Wash and be cleane ?
Then went he downe , and dipped himselfe seuen times in Iordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came againe like vnto the flesh of a litle childe , and he was cleane .
¶ And he returned to the man of God , he and all his company , and came , and stood before him : and he said , Behold , now I know that there is no God in all the earth , but in Israel : now therefore , I pray thee , take a blessing of thy seruant .
But he said , As the Lord liueth , before whom I stand , I will receiue none : And hee vrged him to take it , but he refused .
And Naaman said , Shall there not then , I pray thee , be giuen to thy seruant two mules burden of earth ? for thy seruant wil henceforth offer neither burnt offering , nor sacrifice vnto other gods , but vnto the Lord .
In this thing the Lord pardon thy seruant , that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there , and hee leaneth on my hand , and I bow myselfe in the house of Rimmon : when I bow downe my selfe in the house of Rimmon , the Lord pardon thy seruant in this thing .
And he said vnto him , Go in peace . So he departed from him , a litle way .
¶ But Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God , said , Behold , my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian , in not receiuing at his hands that which hee brought : but as the Lord liueth , I wil runne after him , and take somewhat of him .
So Gehazi followed after Naaman : and when Naaman saw him running after him , hee lighted downe from the charet to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
And he said , All is well : my master hath sent me , saying , Behold , euen now there be come to mee from mount Ephraim two yong men , of the sonnes of the Prophets : Giue them , I pray thee , a talent of siluer , and two changes of garments .
And Naaman said , Bee content , take two talents : and hee vrged him , and bound two talents of siluer in two bags , with two changes of garments , and layde them vpon two of his seruants , and they bare them before him .
And when he came to the towre , he tooke them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house , and hee let the men goe , and they departed .
But he went in , and stood before his master : and Elisha said vnto him , Whence commest thou , Gehazi ? And hee said , Thy seruant went no whither .
And he said vnto him , Went not mine heart with thee , when the man turned againe from his charet to meete thee ? Is it a time to receiue money , and to receiue garments , and Oliue yards , and Uineyards , and sheepe , and oxen , and men seruants , and mayd seruants ?

And the sonnes of the Prophets saide vnto Elisha , Beholde now , the place where wee dwell with thee , is too strait for vs :
Let vs goe , wee pray thee , vnto Iordane , and take thence euery man a beame , and let vs make vs a place there where we may dwell . And hee answered , Goe ye .
And one said , Be content , I pray thee , and goe with thy seruants . And he answered , I will goe .
So hee went with them : and when they came to Iordane , they cut downe wood .
But as one was felling a beame , the axe head fell into the water : and hee cryed , and sayd , Alas master , for it was borrowed .
And the man of God said , Where fell it ? and hee shewed him the place : and he cut downe a sticke , and cast it in thither , and the yron did swimme .
Therefore said he , Take it vp to thee : And hee put out his hand , and tooke it .
¶ Then the king of Syria warred against Israel , and tooke counsell with his seruants , saying , In such and such a place shall be my campe .
And the man of God sent vnto the king of Israel , saying , Beware that thou passe not such a place ; for thither the Syrians are come downe .
And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God tolde him , and warned him of , and saued himselfe there , not once nor twise .
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing , and he called his seruants , and said vnto them , Will ye not shewe me which of vs is for the king of Israel ?
And one of his seruants sayde , None , my lord O king ; but Elisha the Prophet , that is in Israel , telleth the king of Israel , the wordes that thou speakest in thy bed - chamber .
¶ And he said , Goe and spie where he is , that I may send and fetch him . And it was tolde him , saying , Behold , he is in Dothan .
Therefore sent he thither horses , and charets , and a great hoste : and they came by night , and compassed the citie about .
And when the seruant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the citie , both with horses and charets : and his seruant said vnto him , Alas my master , how shall we doe ?
And he answered , Feare not : for they that be with vs , are moe then they that be with them .
And Elisha prayed , and sayde , Lord , I pray thee , open his eyes that he may see . And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man , and hee saw : and behold , the mountaine was full of horses , and charets of fire round about Elisha .
And when they came downe to him , Elisha prayed vnto the Lord , and said , Smite this people , I pray thee , with blindnesse . And hee smote them with blindnesse , according to the word of Elisha .
¶ And Elisha saide vnto them , This is not the way , neither is this the citie : follow me , and I will bring you to the man whom ye seeke . But hee led them to Samaria .
And it came to passe when they were come into Samaria , that Elisha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . And the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw , and beholde , they were in the mids of Samaria .
And the king of Israel saide vnto Elisha , when he saw them , My father , shall I smite them ? shall I smite them ?
And he answered , Thou shalt not smite them : wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captiue with thy sword , and with thy bow ? set bread and water before them , that they may eate , and drinke , and go to their master .
And hee prepared great prouision for them , and when they had eaten and drunke , hee sent them away , and they went to their master : so the bands of Syria came no more into the lande of Israel .
¶ And it came to passe after this , that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his hoste , and went vp , and besieged Samaria .
And there was a great famine in Samaria : and behold , they besieged it , vntill an asses head was solde for fourescore pieces of siluer , and the fourth part of a kab of doues doung for fiue pieces of siluer .
And as the king of Israel was passing by vpon the wall , there cried a woman vnto him , saying , Helpe , my lord , O king .
And he said , If the Lord do not helpe thee , whence shall I helpe thee ? out of the barne floore , or out of the wine presse ?
And the king said vnto her , What aileth thee ? And shee answered , This woman said vnto me , Giue thy sonne , that we may eate him to day , and wee will eate my sonne to morrow .
So we boyled my sonne , and did eate him : and I saide vnto her on the next day , Giue thy sonne , that we may eate him : and she hath hid her sonne .
¶ And it came to passe when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clothes , and hee passed by vpon the wall , and the people looked , and behold , hee had sackcloth within , vpon his flesh .
Then he said , God doe so , and more also to mee , if the head of Elisha the sonne of Shaphat , shall stand on him this day .
But Elisha sate in his house ( and the elders sate with him ) and the king sent a man from before him : but yer the messenger came to him , hee said to the Elders , See yee how this sonne of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head ? Looke when the messenger commeth , shut the doore , and hold him fast at the doore : Is not the sound of his masters feete behind him ?

Then Elisha said , Heare yee the word of the Lord , Thus saith the Lord , To morrowe about this time shal a measure of fine flower be sold for a shekell , and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the gate of Samaria .
Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned , answered the man of God , and said , Behold , if the Lord would make windowes in heauen , might this thing bee ? and he saide , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eies , but shalt not eate thereof .
¶ And there were foure leprous men at the entring in of the gate : and they saide one to another , Why sit wee here vntill we die ?
If we say , We will enter into the citie , then the famine is in the citie , and wee shall die there : and if we sit still here , we die also . Now therefore come , and let vs fall vnto the host of the Syrians : if they saue vs aliue , we shall liue ; and if they kill vs , we shall but die .
And they rose vp in the twilight , to goe vnto the campe of the Syrians : and when they were come to the vttermost part of the campe of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to heare a noise of charets , and a noise of horses , euen the noise of a great host : and they said one to another , Loe , the king of Israel hath hired against vs the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of the Egyptians , to come vpon vs .
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , euen the campe as it was , and fled for their life .
And when these lepers came to the vttermost part of the campe , they went into one tent , and did eate , and drinke , and carried thence siluer , and gold , and raiment , and went and hid it , and came againe , and entred into another tent , and carried thence also , and went and hid it .
Then they said one to another , We doe not well : this day is a day of good tydings , and we hold our peace : if we tarie till the morning light , some mischiefe will come vpon vs : nowe therefore come , that we may goe , and tell the kings houshold .
So they came , and called vnto the porter of the citie : and they told them , saying ; We came to the campe of the Syrians , and behold , there was no man there , neither voice of man , but horses tyed , and asses tyed , and the tents as they were .
And hee called the porters , and they told it to the kings house within .
¶ And the king arose in the night , and said vnto his seruants , I will now shew you what the Syrians haue done to vs : They know that we be hungrie , therefore are they gone out of the camp , to hide themselues in the field , saying ; When they come out of the citie , we shal catch them aliue , and get into the citie .
And one of his seruants answered , and said , Let some take , I pray thee , fiue of the horses that remaine , which are left in the citie : ( behold , they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it : behold , I say , they are euen as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed ) and let vs send , and see .
They tooke therefore two charet horses , and the king sent after the hoste of the Syrians , saying , Goe , and see .
And they went after them vnto Iordane , and loe , all the way was full of garments , and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste : and the messengers returned , and told the king .
And the people went out , and spoiled the tents of the Syrians : So a measure of fine flowre was sold for a shekell , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of the Lord .
¶ And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned , to haue the charge of the gate : and the people trode vpon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who spake when the king came downe to him .
And it came to passe , as the man of God had spoken to the king , saying , Two measures of barley for a shekel , and a measure of fine flowre for a shekel , shalbe to morrow about this time , in the gate of Samaria :
And that lord answered the man of God , and said , Now behold , if the Lord should make windowes in heauen , might such a thing be ? And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eate thereof .

Then spake Elisha vnto the woman ( whose sonne he had restored to life ) saying , Arise , and goe thou and thine housholde , and soiourne whersoeuer thou canst soiourne : for the Lord hath called for a famin , and it shall also come vpon the land seuen yeeres .
And the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her housholde , and soiourned in the land of the Philistines seuen yeeres .
And it came to passe at the seuen yeeres ende , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went foorth to crie vnto the king for her house , and for her land .
And the king talked with Gehazi the seruant of the man of God , saying , Tell mee , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done .
And it came to passe as he was telling the King how hee had restored a dead body to life , that behold , the woman whose sonne he had restored to life , cryed to the King for her house and for her land . And Gehazi said , My lord O king , this is the woman , and this is her sonne , whom Elisha restored to life .
And when the king asked the woman , shee tolde him . So the King appointed vnto her a certaine officer , saying , Restore all that was hers , and all the fruites of the field , since the day that she left the land , euen till now .
¶ And Elisha came to Damascus , and Benhadad the king of Syria was sicke , and it was tolde him , saying , The man of God is come hither .
And the king said vnto Hazael , Take a present in thine hand , and goe meete the man of God , and enquire of the Lord by him , saying , Shall I recouer of this disease ?
So Hazael went to meete him , and tooke a present with him , euen of euery good thing of Damascus , fourtie camels burden , and came , and stood before him , and said , Thy sonne Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee , saying , Shall I recouer of this disease ?
And Elisha said vnto him , Goe , say vnto him , Thou mayest certeinly recouer : howbeit , the Lord hath shewed me , that he shall surely die .
And hee setled his countenance stedfastly , vntill he was ashamed : and the man of God wept .
And Hazael said , Why weepeth my lord ? And he answered , Because I know the euill that thou wilt doe vnto the children of Israel : their strong holds wilt thou set on fire , and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword , and wilt dash their children , and rip vp their women with childe .
And Hazael said , But what , is thy seruant a dogge , that he should doe this great thing ? And Elisha answered , The Lord hath shewed mee that thou shalt be king ouer Syria .
So he departed from Elisha , and came to his master , who saide to him , What said Elisha to thee ? and hee answered , He told me that thou shouldst surely recouer .
And it came to passe on the morrow , that he tooke a thicke cloth , and dipt it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died , and Hazael reigned in his stead .
¶ And in the fifth yeere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab king of Israel , Iehoshaphat being then king of Iudah , Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah began to reigne .
Thirtie and two yeeres old was he when he began to reigne , and hee reigned eight yeeres in Ierusalem .
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife , and hee did euill in the sight of the Lord .
Yet the Lord would not destroy Iudah , for Dauid his seruants sake , as hee promised to giue to him alway a light , and to his children .
¶ In his dayes Edom reuolted from vnder the hand of Iudah , and made a king ouer themselues .
So Ioram went ouer to Zair , and all the charets with him , and hee rose by night , and smote the Edomites , which compassed him about : and the captaines of the charets , and the people fled into their tents .
Yet Edom reuolted from vnder the hand of Iudah vnto this day . Then Libnah reuolted at the same time .
And the rest of the actes of Ioram , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
And Ioram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid : And Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ In the twelfth yeere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab , king of Israel , did Ahaziah , the sonne of Iehoram king of Iudah , begin to reigne .
Two and twentie yeeres old was Ahaziah when he began to reigne , and he reigned one yeere in Ierusalem , and his mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did euill in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab : for hee was the sonne in law of the house of Ahab .
¶ And he went with Ioram the sonne of Ahab , to the warre against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth Gilead , and the Syrians wounded Ioram .

And Elisha the Prophet called one of the children of the Prophets , and said vnto him , Gird vp thy loines , and take this boxe of oile in thine hand , and goe to Ramoth Gilead .
And when thou commest thither , looke out there Iehu the sonne of Iehoshaphat , the sonne of Nimshi , and goe in , and make him arise vp from among his brethren , and carie him to an inner chamber .
Then take the boxe of oile , and powre it on his head , and say , Thus saith the Lord , I haue anointed thee king ouer Israel : then open the doore , and flee , and tary not .
¶ So the yong man , euen the yong man the Prophet , went to Ramoth Gilead :
And when hee came , behold , the captaines of the host were sitting ; and hee said , I haue an errand to thee , O captaine : And Iehu said , Unto which of all vs ? And he said , To thee , O captaine .
And hee arose , and went into the house , and hee powred the oyle on his head , and said vnto him , Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel , I haue anoynted thee king ouer the people of the Lord , euen ouer Israel .
And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master , that I may auenge the blood of my seruants the Prophets , and the blood of all the seruants of the Lord , at the hand of Iezebel .
For the whole house of Ahab shal perish , and I will cut off from Ahab , him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut vp and left in Israel .
And I will make the house of Ahab , like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah .
And the dogges shal eate Iezebel in the portion of Iezreel , and there shal be none to burie her . And he opened the doore , and fled .
¶ Then Iehu came foorth to the seruants of his lord , and one said vnto him , Is all well ? wherefore came this madde fellow to thee ? And he said vnto them , Yee know the man , and his communication .
And they said , It is false , tell vs now : And hee sayde , Thus and thus spake he to me , saying , Thus saith the Lord , I haue anoynted thee King ouer Israel .
Then they hasted , and tooke euery man his garment , and put it vnder him on the top of the staires , and blewe with trumpets , saying , Iehu is king .
So Iehu the sonne of Iehoshaphat , the sonne of Nimshi , conspired against Ioram : ( now Ioram had kept Ramoth Gilead , hee , and all Israel , because of Hazael king of Syria :
But king Ioram was returned to bee healed in Iezreel , of the wounds which the Syrians had giuen him , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . ) And Iehu said , If it be your minds , then let none goe forth nor escape out of the citie , to goe to tell it in Iezreel .
So Iehu rode in a charet , and went to Iezreel , ( for Ioram lay there : ) and Ahaziah king of Iudah was come downe to see Ioram .
And there stood a watchman on the towre in Iezreel , and hee spied the company of Iehu as he came , and said , I see a companie . And Ioram sayd , Take an horseman , and send to meete them , and let him say , Is it peace ?
So there went one on horsebacke to meete him , and said , Thus sayth the king , Is it peace ? And Iehu said , What hast thou to doe with peace ? turne thee behinde me . And the watchman tolde , saying , The messenger came to them , but he commeth not againe .
Then he sent out a second on horsebacke , which came to them , and sayd , Thus sayth the king , Is it peace ? And Iehu answered , What hast thou to doe with peace ? turne thee behinde me .
And the watchman tolde , saying , He came euen vnto them , and commeth not againe : and the driuing is like the driuing of Iehu the sonne of Nimshi ; for he driueth furiously .
And Ioram said , Make readie . And his charet was made ready . And Ioram king of Israel , and Ahaziah king of Iudah , went out , each in his charet , and they went out against Iehu , and met him in the portion of Naboth the Iezreelite .
And it came to passe when Ioram saw Iehu , that hee said , Is it peace , Iehu ? And he answered , What peace , so long as the whoredomes of thy mother Iezebel , and her witchcrafts are so many ?
And Ioram turned his hand , and fled , and said to Ahaziah , There is treachery , O Ahaziah .
And Iehu drew a bowe with his full strength , and smote Iehoram betweene his armes , and the arrow went out at his heart , and hee sunke downe in his charet .
Then said Iehu to Bidkar his captaine , Take vp , and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Iezreelite : for remember , how that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father , the Lord laide this burden vpon him :
Surely I haue seene yesterday the blood of Naboth , and the blood of his sonnes , sayd the Lord , and I will requite thee in this plat , sayth the Lord . Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground , according to the word of the Lord .
¶ But when Ahaziah the king of Iudah saw this , hee fled by the way of the garden house : and Iehu followed after him , and said , Smite him also in the charet ; and they did so , at the going vp to Gur , which is by Ibleam : And hee fled to Megiddo , and died there .
And his seruants caried him in a charet to Ierusalem , and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers , in the citie of Dauid .
And in the eleuenth yeere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab , began Ahaziah to reigne ouer Iudah .
¶ And when Iehu was come to Iezreel , Iezebel heard of it , and shee painted her face , and tyred her head , and looked out at a window .
And as Iehu entred in at the gate , she said , Had Zimri peace , who slew his master ?
And he lift vp his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side , who ? And there looked out to him two or three Eunuches .
And he said , Throw her downe . So they threw her downe , and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her vnder foote .
And when he was come in , hee did eate and drinke , and saide , Goe , see now this cursed woman , and burie her : for she is a kings daughter .
And they went to burie her , but they found no more of her then the skul , and the feete , & the palmes of her hands .
Wherefore they came againe , and told him : and he said , This is the word of the Lord , which he spake by his seruant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , In the portion of Iezreel shall dogs eate the flesh of Iezebel :

And Ahab had seuentie sonnes in Samaria : and Iehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria vnto the rulers of Iezreel , to the Elders , and to them that brought vp Ahabs children , saying ,
Now assoone as this letter commeth to you , seeing your masters sons are with you , and there are with you charets and horses , a fenced citie also , and armour :
Looke euen out the best and meetest of your masters sonnes , and set him on his fathers throne , and fight for your masters house .
But they were exceedingly afraid , and said , Behold , two kings stood not before him : how then shall we stand ?
And he that was ouer the house , and he that was ouer the citie , the elders also , and the bringers vp of the children , sent to Iehu , saying , Wee are thy seruants , and will doe all that thou shalt bid vs , we will not make any king : doe thou that which is good in thine eyes .
Then he wrote a letter the second time to them , saying , If yee be mine , and if ye will hearken vnto my voyce , take ye the heads of the men your masters sonnes , and come to me to Iezreel by to morow this time : ( now the kings sonnes being seuenty persons , were with the great men of the city , which brought them vp . )
And it came to passe when the letter came to them , that they tooke the kings sonnes , and slewe seuentie persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Iezreel .
¶ And there came a messenger , and tolde him , saying , They haue brought the heads of the kings sonnes . And he said , Lay ye them in two heaps at the entring in of the gate , vntill the morning .
And it came to passe in the morning , that he went out , & stood , and said to all the people , Ye be righteous : behold , I conspired against my master , and slew him : But who slew all these ?
Know now , that there shall fall vnto the earth nothing of the worde of the Lord , which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab : for the Lord hath done that which he spake by his seruant Elijah .
So Iehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab , in Iezreel , and all his great men , and his kinsefolkes , and his priests , vntill he left him none remaining .
¶ And hee arose , and departed , and came to Samaria : And as he was at the shearing house in the way ,
Iehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Iudah , and said , Who are ye ? And they answered , Wee are the brethren of Ahaziah , and we go downe to salute the children of the King , and the children of the Queene .
And hee said , Take them aliue . And they tooke them aliue , and slew them at the pit of the shearing house , euen two and fourty men ; neither left he any of them .
¶ And when hee was departed thence , he lighted on Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab , comming to meet him : and he saluted him , & said to him , Is thine heart right , as my heart is with thy heart ? And Iehonadab answered , It is : If it be , giue mee thine hand . And hee gaue him his hand , and hee tooke him vp to him into the charet .
And he said , Come with me , and see my zeale for the Lord : so they made him ride in his charet .
And when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained vnto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he spake to Eliiah .
¶ And Iehu gathered all the people together , and said vnto them , Ahab serued Baal a litle , but Iehu shall serue him much .
Now therefore , call vnto me all the prophets of Baal , all his seruants , and all his priests , let none be wanting : for I haue a great sacrifice to doe to Baal ; whosoeuer shall be wanting , he shall not liue . But Iehu did it in subtilitie , to the intent that hee might destroy the worshippers of Baal .
And Iehu said , Proclaime a solemne assembly for Baal . And they proclaimed it .
And Iehu sent through all Israel , and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not : and they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
And he said vnto him that was ouer the vestrie , Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal . And he brought them forth vestments .
And Iehu went , and Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab into the house of Baal , and said vnto the worshippers of Baal , Search , and looke that there be here with you none of the seruants of the Lord , but the worshippers of Baal onely .
And when they went in to offer sacrifices , and burnt offerings , Iehu appointed fourescore men without , and said , If any of the men whom I haue brought into your hands , escape , hee that letteth him goe , his life shall be for the life of him .
And it came to passe assoone as hee had made an end of offering the burnt offering , that Iehu saide to the guard , and to the captaines , Goe in , and slay them , let none come foorth . And they smote them with the edge of the sword , and the guard , and the captaines cast them out , and went to the citie of the house of Baal . And they brought foorth the Images out of the house of Baal , and burnt them .
And they brake downe the image of Baal , and brake downe the house of Baal , and made it a draughthouse , vnto this day .
Thus Iehu destroyed Baal out of Israel .
¶ Howbeit , from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne , Iehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calues that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
And the Lord said vnto Iehu , Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes , and hast done vnto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart , thy children of the fourth generation , shal sit on the throne of Israel .
But Iehu tooke no heede to walke in the Law of the Lord God of Israel , with all his heart : for he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam , which made Israel to sinne .
¶ In those dayes the Lord began to cut Israel short : and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel :
From Iordan Eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , ( which is by the riuer Arnon ) euen Gilead and Bashan .
Now the rest of the acts of Iehu , and all that he did , & all his might , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
And Iehu slept with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria , and Iehoahaz his sonne reigned in his stead .

And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah sawe that her sonne was dead , she arose , and destroyed all the seed royall .
But Iehosheba the daughter of king Ioram , sister of Ahaziah , tooke Ioash the sonne of Ahaziah , and stale him from among the Kings sonnes which were slaine ; and they hid him , euen him and his nurse in the bed - chamber from Athaliah , so that he was not slaine .
And he was with her hidde in the House of the Lord , sixe yeeres : and Athaliah did reigne ouer the land .
¶ And the seuenth yeere Iehoiada sent and fet the rulers ouer hundreds , with the captains , and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the Lord , and made a couenant with them , and tooke an othe of them in the house of the Lord , and shewed them the Kings sonne .
And he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that yee shall doe ; A third part of you that enter in on the Sabbath , shall euen be keepers of the watch of the kings house :
And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur , and a third part at the gate behinde the guard : so shall yee keepe the watch of the house , that it be not broken downe .
And two parts of all you , that goe foorth on the Sabbath , euen they shall keepe the watch of the house of the Lord about the King .
And yee shall compasse the King round about , euery man with his weapons in his hand : and he that commeth within the ranges , let him bee slaine : and be yee with the king , as hee goeth out , and as he commeth in .
And the captaines ouer the hundreds did according to all things that Iehoiada the Priest commanded : and they tooke euery man his men that were to come in on the Sabbath , with them that should goe out on the Sabbath , and came to Iehoiada the Priest .
And to the captaines ouer hundreds , did the Priest giue king Dauids speares and shields , that were in the Temple .
And the guard stood , euery man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the Temple , to the left corner of the Temple , along by the Altar and the Temple .
And he brought foorth the kings sonne , and put the crowne vpon him , and gaue him the Testimonie , and they made him King , and anointed him , and they clapt their hands , and said , God saue the King .
¶ And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard , and of the people , she came to the people , into the Temple of the Lord .
And when shee looked , behold , the king stood by a pillar , as the maner was , and the Princes , and the trumpetters by the King , and all the people of the land reioyced , and blew with trumpets : and Athaliah rent her clothes , and cryed , Treason , treason .
But Iehoiada the Priest commanded the captaines of the hundreds , the officers of the hoste , and sayde vnto them , Haue her foorth without the ranges ; and him that followeth her , kill with the sword : for the Priest had sayd , Let her not be slaine in the house of the Lord .
And they laid hands on her , and she went by the way , by the which the horses came into the kings house , and there was she slaine .
¶ And Iehoiada made a couenant betweene the Lord and the king , and the people , that they should be the Lords people ; betweene the king also and the people .
And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal , and brake it down , his altars , and his images brake they in pieces throughly , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars : and the Priest appointed officers ouer the house of the Lord .
And hee tooke the rulers ouer hundreds , and the captaines , and the guard , and all the people of the land , and they brought downe the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard , to the kings house , and he sate on the throne of the kings .

In the seuenth yeere of Iehu , Iehoash began to reigne , and fourtie yeeres reigned he in Ierusalem , and his mothers name was Zibiah of Beersheba .
And Iehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his dayes , wherein Iehoiada the Priest instructed him .
But the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed , and burnt incense in the high places . ¶ And Iehoash said to the priests , All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord , euen the money of euery one that passeth the account , the money that euery man is set at , and all the money that commeth into any mans heart , to bring into the house of the Lord ,
Let the priests take it to them , euery man of his acquaintance , and let them repaire the breaches of the house , wheresoeuer any breach shalbe found .
But it was so that in the three and twentieth yeere of king Iehoash , the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
Then king Iehoash called for Iehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and saide vnto them , Why repaire ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receiue no more money of your acquaintance , but deliuer it for the breaches of the house .
And the priests consented to receiue no more money of the people , neither to repaire the breaches of the house .
But Iehoiada the priest tooke a chest , and bored a hole in the lid of it , and set it beside the Altar , on the right side , as one commeth into the house of the Lord , and the priests that kept the doore , put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord .
And it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the kings scribe , and the high priest came vp , and they put vp in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord . And they gaue the money , being told , into the handes of them that did the worke , that had the ouersight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders , that wrought vpon the house of the Lord ,
And to Masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber , and hewed stone to repaire the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repaire it .
Howbeit , there were not made for the house of the Lord , bowles of siluer , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of siluer , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
But they gaue that to the workemen , and repaired therewith the house of the Lord .
Moreouer , they reckned not with the men , into whose hand they deliuered the money to be bestowed on workmen : for they dealt faithfully .
The trespasse money , and sinnemoney was not brought into the house of the Lord : it was the Priests .
¶ Then Hazael king of Syria went vp , and fought against Gath , and tooke it : and Hazael set his face to goe vp to Ierusalem .
And Iehoash king of Iudah tooke all the hallowed things that Iehoshaphat , and Iehoram , and Ahaziah his fathers , kings of Iudah had dedicate , and his owne hallowed things , and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord , and in the kings house , and sent it to Hazael king of Syria , and hee went away from Ierusalem .

Neuerthelesse , they departed not from the sinnes of the house of Ieroboam , who made Israel sinne , but walked therein : and there remained the groue also in Samaria . )
Neither did he leaue of the people to Iehoahaz , but fiftie horsemen , and tenne charets , and tenne thousand footmen : for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .

And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord ; hee departed not from all the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel sinne : but hee walked therein .
And the rest of the actes of Ioash , and all that hee did , and his might , wherewith hee fought against Amaziah king of Iudah , are they not written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
And Ioash slept with his fathers , and Ieroboam sate vpon his throne : and Ioash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
¶ Nowe Elisha was fallen sicke , of his sicknesse whereof he died , and Ioash the king of Israel came downe vnto him , and wept ouer his face , and said , O my father , my father , the charet of Israel , and the horsemen thereof .
And Elisha said vnto him , Take bowe and arrowes . And he tooke vnto him bowe and arrowes .
And he said to the king of Israel , Put thine hand vpon the bowe . And he put his hand vpon it : and Elisha put his hands vpon the kings hands .
And he sayd , Open the window Eastward . And hee opened it . Then Elisha sayd , Shoote . And he shot . And he said ; The arrowe of the Lords deliuerance , and the arrowe of deliuerance from Syria : for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek , till thou haue consumed them .
And he sayd , Take the arrowes . And he tooke them . And hee said vnto the king of Israel , Smite vpon the ground . And he smote thrise , and stayed .
And the man of God was wroth with him , and saide , Thou shouldest haue smitten fiue or sixe times , then haddest thou smitten Syria till thou haddest consumed it : whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice .
¶ And Elisha died , and they buried him : And the bands of the Moabites inuaded the land at the comming in of the yeere .
And it came to passe as they were burying a man , that behold , they spyed a band of men , and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha : and when the man was let downe , and touched the bones of Elisha , he reuiued , and stood vp on his feete .
¶ But Hazael king of Syria , oppressed Israel all the dayes of Iehoahaz .
And the Lord was gracious vnto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect vnto them , because of his couenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Iacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast hee them from his presence as yet .
So Hazael the king of Syria dyed , and Benhadad his sonne reigned in his stead .
<NON-VERSE>
In the second yeere of Ioash sonne of Iehoahaz king of Israel , reigned Amaziah the sonne of Ioash king of Iudah .
Hee was twentie and fiue yeeres olde when he began to reigne , and reigned twentie and nine yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Iehoaddan of Ierusalem .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like Dauid his father : hee did according to all things as Ioash his father did .
Howbeit , the high places were not taken away : as yet the people did sacrifice , and burnt incense on the high places .
¶ And it came to passe assoone as the kingdome was confirmed in his hand , that he slew his seruants which had slaine the king his father .
But the children of the murderers he slew not , according vnto that which is written in the booke of the Law of Moses , wherein the Lord commanded , saying , The fathers shal not be put to death for the children , nor the children be put to death for the fathers : but euery man shall be put to death for his owne sinne .
He slew of Edom in the valley of salt , ten thousand , and tooke Selah by warre , and called the name of it , Ioktheel , vnto this day .
¶ Then Amaziah sent messengers to Iehoash the sonne of Iehoahaz sonne of Iehu king of Israel , saying , Come , let vs looke one another in the face .
And Iehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Iudah , saying , The thistle that was in Lebanon , sent to the Cedar that was in Lebanon , saying , Giue thy daughter to my sonne to wife . And there passed by a wilde beast that was in Lebanon , and trode downe the thistle .
Thou hast indeed smitten Edom , and thine heart hath lifted thee vp : glory of this , and tary at home : for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt , that thou shouldest fall , euen thou , and Iudah with thee ?
But Amaziah would not heare : therefore Iehoash king of Israel went vp , and hee , and Amaziah king of Iudah , looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh , which belongeth to Iudah .
And Iudah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled euery man to their tents .
And Iehoash king of Israel tooke Amaziah king of Iudah , the sonne of Iehoash the sonne of Ahaziah at Bethshemesh , and came to Ierusalem , and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem , from the gate of Ephraim , vnto the corner gate , foure hundred cubites .
And he tooke all the golde and siluer , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the kings house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
¶ Now the rest of the acts of Iehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Iudah , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
And Iehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria , with the kings of Israel , and Ieroboam his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash king of Iudah , liued after the death of Iehoash sonne of Iehoahaz king of Israel , fifteene yeeres .
And the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
Now they made a conspiracie against him in Ierusalem : and he fled to Lachish , but they sent after him to Lachish , and slew him there .
And they brought him on horses , and he was buried at Ierusalem with his fathers , in the city of Dauid .
¶ And all the people of Iudah tooke Azariah ( which was sixteene yeeres old ) and made him king in stead of his father Amaziah .
He built Elath , and restored it to Iudah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
¶ In the fifteenth yeere of Amaziah the sonne of Ioash king of Iudah , Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash king of Israel began to raigne in Samaria , and raigned forty and one yeeres :
And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord : hee departed not from all the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne .
Hee restored the coast of Israel , from the entring of Hamath , vnto the sea of the plaine , according to the word of the Lord God of Israel , which he spake by the hand of his seruant Ionah , the sonne of Amittai the Prophet , which was of Gath Hepher .
For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut vp , nor any left , nor any helper for Israel .
And the Lord said not , that hee would blot out the name of Israel from vnder heauen : but he saued them by the hand of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Ieroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recouered Damascus and Hamath , which belonged to Iudah , for Israel , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
<NON-VERSE>
In the twenty and seuenth yeere of Ieroboam king of Israel , began Azariah sonne of Amaziah king of Iudah to reigne .
Sixteene yeeres old was he when he began to reigne , and he reigned two aud fifty yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Iecholiah of Ierusalem .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah had done ;
Saue that the high places were not remoued : the people sacrificed , and burnt incense still on the high places .
¶ And the Lord smote the king , so that hee was a Leper vnto the day of his death , and dwelt in a seuerall house , and Iotham the kings sonne was ouer the house , iudging the people of the land .
And the rest of the actes of Azariah , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
So Azariah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the city of Dauid , and Iotham his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ In the thirty and eight yeere of Azariah king of Iudah , did Zachariah the sonne of Ieroboam reigne ouer Israel in Samaria sixe moneths .
And hee did that which was euil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne .
And Shallum the sonne of Iabesh , conspired against him , and smote him before the people , and slewe him , and reigned in his stead .
And the rest of the actes of Zachariah , beholde , they are written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
This was the word of the Lord which he spake vnto Iehu , saying , Thy sonnes shall sit on the throne of Israel , vnto the fourth generation . And so it came to passe .
¶ Shallum the sonne of Iabesh began to reigne in the nine and thirtieth yeere of Uzziah king of Iudah , and he reigned a full moneth in Samaria .
For Menahem the sonne of Gadi , went vp from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and smote Shallum the sonne of Iabesh , in Samaria , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
And the rest of the actes of Shallum , and the conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
¶ Then Menahem smote Tiphsah , and all that were therein , and the coasts thereof from Tirzah : because they opened not to him , therfore he smote it , and all the women therein that were with child , he ript vp .
In the nine and thirtieth yeere of Azariah king of Iudah , began Menahem the sonne of Gadi to reigne ouer Israel , and reigned tenne yeres in Samaria .
And Menahem exacted the mony of Israel , euen of all the mightie men of wealth , of each man fiftie shekels of siluer , to giue to the king of Assyria : so the king of Assyria turned backe , and stayed not there in the land .
¶ And the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
And Menahem slept with his fathers , and Pekahiah his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ In the fiftieth yere of Azariah king of Iudah , Pekahiah the sonne of Menahem began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria , and reigned two yeeres .
And he did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , hee departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne .
But Pekah the sonne of Remaliah , a captaine of his , conspired against him , and smote him in Samaria , in the palace of the kings house , with Argob , and Arieh , and with him fiftie men of the Gileadites : and hee killed him , and reigned in his roume .
And the rest of the actes of Pekahiah , and all that he did , beholde , they are written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
¶ In the two and fiftieth yeere of Azariah king of Iudah , Pekah the sonne of Remaliah began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria , and reigned twentie yeeres .
And he did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , hee departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne .
In the dayes of Pekah king of Israel , came Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , and tooke Iion , and Abel - Beth - maachah , and Ianoah , and Kedesh , and Hazor , and Gilead , and Galilee , all the land of Naphtali , and caried them captiue to Assyria .
And Hoshea the sonne of Elah , made a conspiracie against Pekah the sonne of Remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth yeere of Iotham the sonne of Uzziah .
And the rest of the actes of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel .
¶ In the second yeere of Pekah the sonne of Remaliah king of Israel , began Iotham the sonne of Uzziah king of Iudah to reigne .
Fiue and twentie yeeres olde was he when he began to reigne , and hee reigned sixteene yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Ierusha , the daughter of Zadok .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord : hee did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
¶ Howbeit , the high places were not remoued : the people sacrificed and burnt incense still in the high places : He built the higher gate of the house of the Lord .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Iotham , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
( In those dayes the Lord began to send against Iudah , Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the sonne of Remaliah )
<NON-VERSE>
In the seuenteenth yeere of Pekah the sonne of Remaliah , Ahaz the sonne of Iotham King of Iudah began to reigne .
Twentie yeeres olde was Ahaz when hee began to reigne , and reigned sixteene yeeres in Ierusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God , like Dauid his father :
But hee walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea & made his sonne to passe through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
And hee sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hils , and vnder euery greene tree .
¶ Then Rezin king of Syria , and Pekah sonne of Remaliah king of Israel , came vp to Ierusalem to warre : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not ouercome him .
At that time Rezin king of Syria , recouered Elath to Syria , & draue the Iewes from Elath : and the Syrians came to Elath , and dwelt there vnto this day .
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am thy seruant , and thy sonne : come vp , and saue me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise vp against me .
And Ahaz tooke the siluer and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the kings house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
And the king of Assyria hearkened vnto him : for the king of Assyria went vp against Damascus , and tooke it , and caried the people of it captiue to Kir , and slew Rezin .
¶ And King Ahaz went to Damascus , to meete Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , and saw an altar that was at Damascus : and king Ahaz sent to Uriiah the Priest the fashion of the altar , and the paterne of it , according to all the workemanship thereof .
And Uriiah the Priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Uriiah the Priest made it , against king Ahaz came from Damascus .
And when the king was come from Damascus , the King saw the altar : and the King approched to the altar , and offered thereon .
And he burnt his burnt offering , and his meate offering , and powred his drinke offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings vpon the altar .
And hee brought also the brasen altar which was before the Lord , from the forefront of the house , from betweene the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the North side of the altar .
And king Ahaz commanded Uriiah the Priest , saying , Upon the great altar , burne the morning burnt offering , and the euening meate offering , and the Kings burnt sacrifice , and his meate offering , with the burnt offering of all the people of the land , and their meate offering , and their drinke offerings , and sprinkle vpon it all the blood of the burnt offering , and all the blood of the sacrifice : and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by .
Thus did Uriiah the Priest , according to all that king Ahaz commaunded .
¶ And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and remooued the lauer from off them , and tooke downe the sea from off the brasen oxen that were vnder it , and put it vpon a pauement of stones :
And the couert for the Sabbath that they had built in the house , and the kings entry without , turned hee from the house of the Lord , for the king of Assyria .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Ahaz , which he did , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
<NON-VERSE>
In the twelfth yeere of Ahaz , king of Iudah , began Hoshea the sonne of Elah to reigne in Samaria , ouer Israel nine yeeres .
And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
¶ Against him came vp Shalmaneser king of Assyria , and Hoshea became his seruant , and gaue him presents .
An the king of Assyria found conspiracie in Hoshea : for hee had sent messengers to So king of Egypt , and brought no present to the king of Assyria , as he had done yeere by yeere : therefore the king of Assyria shut him vp , and bound him in prison .
¶ Then the king of Assyria came vp thorowout all the land , and went vp to Samaria , and besieged it three yeres .
¶ In the ninth yeere of Hoshea , the king of Assyria tooke Samaria , and caried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and in Habor by the riuer of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
For so it was , that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God , which had brought them vp out of the land of Egypt , from vnder the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
And walked in the statutes of the heathen , ( whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel ) and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right , against the Lord their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen , to the fenced city .
And they set them vp images , and groues in euery high hill , and vnder euery greene tree .
And there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the Lord caried away before them , and wrought wicked things to prouoke the Lord to anger .
For they serued idoles , whereof the Lord had said vnto them , Yee shall not doe this thing .
Yet the Lord testified against Israel , and against Iudah , by all the Prophets , and by all the Seers , saying , Turne ye from your euill wayes , and keepe my commandements , and my statutes , according to all the law which I commanded your fathers , and which I sent to you by my seruants the Prophets .
Notwithstanding , they would not heare , but hardened their neckes , like to the necke of their fathers , that did not beleeue in the Lord their God .
And they reiected his Statutes , and his Couenant that hee made with their fathers , and his Testimonies which he testified against them , and they followed vanitie , and became vaine , and went after the heathen that were round about them , concerning whom the Lord had charged them , that they should not doe like them .
And they left all the Commandements of the Lord their God , and made them molten images , euen two calues , and made a groue , and worshipped all the hoste of heauen , and serued Baal .
And they caused their sonnes and their daughters to passe through the fire , and vsed diuination , and inchantments , and sold themselues to doe euill in the sight of the Lord , to prouoke him to anger .
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and remoued them out of his sight , there was none left , but the tribe of Iudah onely .
Also Iudah kept not the Commandements of the Lord their God , but walked in the Statutes of Israel which they made .
And the Lord reiected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and deliuered them into the hand of spoilers , vntill he had cast them out of his sight .
For he rent Israel from the house of Dauid , and they made Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat king , and Ieroboam draue Israel from following the Lord , and made them sinne a great sinne .
For the children of Israel walked in al the sinnes of Ieroboam which he did , they departed not from them :
Untill the Lord remoued Israel out of his sight , as hee had said by all his seruants the Prophets : so was Israel caried away out of their owne land to Assyria , vnto this day .
¶ And the King of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Aua , and from Hamath , and from Sepharuaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria , in stead of the children of Israel ; and they possessed Samaria , and dwelt in the cities thereof .
And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the Lord ; therefore the Lord sent Lions among them , which slew some of them .
Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria , saying , The nations which thou hast remoued , and placed in the cities of Samaria , know not the maner of the God of the land : therfore he hath sent Lions among them , and beholde , they slay them , because they know not the maner of the God of the land .
Then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , Carie thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence , and let them goe and dwell there , and let him teach them the maner of the God of the land .
Then one of the priests whom they had caried away from Samaria , came and dwelt in Bethel , and taught them howe they should feare the Lord .
Howbeit , euery nation made gods of their owne , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritanes had made , euery nation in their cities wherein they dwelt :
And the men of Babylon made Succoth - Benoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima :
And the Auites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharuites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech , and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharuaim .
So they feared the Lord , and made vnto themselues of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
They feared the Lord , and serued their owne gods , after the maner of the nations whom they caried away from thence .
Unto this day they doe after the former maners : they feare not the Lord , neither doe they after their Statutes , or after their Ordinances , or after the Law and Commaundement which the Lord commaunded the children of Iacob , whom hee named Israel ,
With whom the Lord had made a Couenant , and charged them , saying , Yee shall not feare other gods , nor bow your selues to them , nor serue them , nor sacrifice to them :
But the Lord , who brought you vp out of the land of Egypt , with great power , and a stretched out arme , him shall ye feare , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye doe sacrifice .
And the Statutes , and the Ordinances , and the Law , and the Commandement which he wrote for you , ye shall obserue to doe for euermore , and ye shall not feare other gods :
And the Couenant that I haue made with you , ye shall no forget , neither shall ye feare other gods .
But the Lord your God yee shall feare , and he shall deliuer you out of the hand of all your enemies .
Howbeit , they did not hearken , but they did after their former maner .
<NON-VERSE>
Now it came to passe in the third yere of Hoshea sonne of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the sonne of Ahaz king of Iudah , began to reigne .
Twentie and fiue yeeres old was he when hee began to reigne , and hee reigned twentie and nine yeeres in Ierusalem : His mothers name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Dauid his father did .
¶ He remooued the high places , and brake the images , and cut downe the groues , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made : for vnto those dayes the children of Israel did burne incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan .
He trusted in the Lord God of Israel , so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Iudah , nor any that were before him .
For he claue to the Lord , and departed not from following him , but kept his commandements , which the Lord commanded Moses .
And the Lord was with him , and hee prospered whithersoeuer hee went forth : and he rebelled against the king of Assyria , and serued him not .
He smote the Philistines euen vnto Gaza , and the borders thereof , from the towre of the watchmen to the fenced cities .
¶ And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of king Hezekiah , ( which was the seuenth yeere of Hoshea , sonne of Elah king of Israel ) that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came vp against Samaria , and besieged it .
And at the end of three yeeres they tooke it : euen in the sixt yeere of Hezekiah ( that is the ninth yeere of Hoshea king of Israel ) Samaria was taken .
And the king of Assyria did carie away Israel vnto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the riuer of Gozan , & in the cities of the Medes :
Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God , but transgressed his Couenant , and all that Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded , and would not heare them , nor doe them .
¶ Now in the fourteenth yeere of king Hezekiah , did Sennacherib king of Assyria come vp against all the fenced cities of Iudah , and tooke them .
And Hezekiah king of Iudah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish , saying , I haue offended , returne from me : that which thou puttest on me , wil I beare . And the king of Assyria appointed vnto Hezekiah king of Iudah , three hundred talents of siluer , and thirtie talents of gold .
And Hezekiah gaue him all the siluer that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the kings house .
At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doores of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Iudah had ouerlaid , and gaue it to the king of Assyria .
¶ And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris , and Rabshakeh , from Lachish to king Hezekiah , with a great hoste against Ierusalem : and they went vp , and came to Ierusalem : and when they were come vp , they came and stood by the conduit of the vpper poole , which is in the high way of the fullers field .
And when they had called to the king there came out to them Eliakim the sonne of Helkiah , which was ouer the houshold , and Shebna the Scribe , and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the Recorder .
And Rabshakeh said vnto them , Speake yee now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
Thou sayest , ( but they are but vaine words ) I haue counsell and strength for the warre : now on whom doest thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
Now behold , thou trustest vpon the staffe of this bruised reed , euen vpon Egypt , on which if a man leane , it will goe into his hand , and pierce it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt vnto all that trust on him .
But if ye say vnto me , We trust in the Lord our God : is not that hee whose high places , and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and hath said to Iudah and Ierusalem , Ye shall worship before this altar in Ierusalem ?
Now therefore , I pray thee , giue pledges to my lord the king of Assyria , and I will deliuer thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders vpon them .
How then wilt thou turne away the face of one captaine of the least of my masters seruants , and put thy trust on Egypt for charets and for horsemen ?
Am I now come vp without the Lord against this place , to destroy it ? The Lord sayd to me , Goe vp against this land , and destroy it .
Then said Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah , and Shebna , and Ioah , vnto Rabshakeh , Speake , I pray thee , to thy seruants in the Syrian language , ( for wee vnderstand it ) and talke not with vs in the Iewes language , in the eares of the people that are on the wall .
But Rabshakeh sayd vnto them , Hath my master sent me to thy master , and to thee , to speake these wordes ? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall , that they may eate their owne doung , and drinke their owne pisse with you ?
Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loude voice in the Iewes language , and spake , saying , Heare the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
Thus sayth the king , Let not Hezekiah deceiue you , for he shall not be able to deliuer you out of his hand :
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliuer vs , and this city shall not bee deliuered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
Hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus sayth the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eate yee euery man of his owne vine , and euery one of his figge tree , and drinke yee euery one the waters of his cisterne :
Untill I come and take you away to a land like your owne land , a land of corne and wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of oile Oliue , and of honie , that yee may liue , and not die : and hearken not vnto Hezekiah , when hee perswadeth you , saying , The Lord will deliuer vs .
Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
Where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharuaim , Hena , and Iuah ? haue they deliuered Samaria out of mine hand ?
Who are they among all the gods of the countreys , that haue deliuered their countrey out of mine hand , that the Lord should deliuer Ierusalem out of mine hand ?
But the people helde their peace , and answered him not a word : for the kings commaundement was , saying , Answere him not .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when King Hezekiah heard it , that hee rent his clothes , and couered himselfe with sackecloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
And hee sent Eliakim , which was ouer the houshold , and Shebna the Scribe , and the Elders of the Priests , couered with sackcloth , to Esai the Prophet the sonne of Amoz .
And they sayd vnto him , Thus sayth Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemie : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring foorth .
It may be , the Lord thy God will heare all the words of Rabshakeh whome the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproch the liuing God , and will reprooue the wordes which the Lord thy God hath heard : wherefore lift vp thy prayer for the remnant that are left .
So the seruants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
¶ And Isaiah said vnto them , Thus shal ye say to your master , Thus saith the Lord , Be not afraid of the wordes which thou hast heard , with which the seruants of the king of Assyria haue blasphemed me .
Behold , I will send a blast vpon him , and he shall heare a rumour , and shall returne to his owne land , and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his owne land .
¶ So Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for hee had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , Behold , hee is come out to fight against thee : hee sent messengers againe vnto Hezekiah , saying ,
Thus shall ye speake to Hezekiah king of Iudah , saying , Let not thy God in whome thou trustest , deceiue thee , saying , Ierusalem shall not be deliuered into the hande of the king of Assyria .
Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria haue done to all lands , by destroying them vtterly : and shalt thou be deliuered ?
Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed ? As Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar ?
Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the citie of Sepharuaim , of Hena , and Iuah ?
¶ And Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went vp into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord , and said , O Lord God of Israel , which dwellest between the Cherubims , thou art the God , euen thou alone , of all the kingdomes of the earth , thou hast made heauen and earth .
Lord , bow downe thine eare , and heare : open , Lord , thine eyes ; and see : and heare the words of Sennacherib which hath sent him to reproch the liuing God .
Of a trueth , Lord , the kings of Assyria haue destroyed the nations and their lands ,
And haue cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of mens hands , wood and stone : therfore they haue destroyed them .
Now therefore , O Lord our God , I beseech thee , saue thou vs out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know , that thou art the Lord God , euen thou onely .
¶ Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , That which thou hast prayed to mee against Sennacherib king of Assyria , I haue heard .
This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him , The Uirgin , the daughter of Zion hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorne , the daughter of Ierusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
Whome hast thou reproched and blasphemed ? and against whome hast thou exalted thy voyce , and lift vp thine eyes on high ? euen against the Holy One of Israel .
By thy messengers thou hast reproched the Lord , and hast said , With the multitude of my charets , I am come vp to the height of the mountaines , to the sides of Lebanon , and will cut downe the tall cedar trees thereof , and the choice firre trees thereof : and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders , and into the forrest of his Carmel .
I haue digged & drunke strange waters , and with the sole of my feete haue I dried vp all the riuers of besieged places .
Hast thou not heard long agoe , how I haue done it , and of ancient times that I haue formed it ? now haue I brought it to passe , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heapes .
Therefore their Inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded , they were as the grasse of the field , and as the greene herbe , as the grasse on the house tops , and as corne blasted before it be growen vp .
But I know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .
Because thy rage against me , and thy tumult is come vp into mine eares , therefore I will put my hooke in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and I will turne thee backe by the way by which thou camest .
And this shalbe a signe vnto thee , Yee shall eate this yeere such things as grow of themselues , and in the second yeere that which springeth of the same , and in the third yeere sow ye and reape , and plant Uineyards , and eate the fruits thereof .
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah , shall yet againe take root downeward , and beare fruit vpward .
For out of Ierusalem shall goe forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this .
Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a banke against it :
By the way that hee came , by the same shal he returne , and shal not come into this city , saith the Lord .
For I will defend this citie , to saue it , for mine owne sake , and for my seruant Dauids sake .
¶ And it came to passe that night , that the Angel of the Lord went out , and smote in the campe of the Assyrians , an hundred foure score and fiue thousand : and when they arose earely in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at Nineueh .

In those dayes was Hezekiah sicke vnto death : and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne of Amos came to him , and saide vnto him , Thus saith the Lord , Set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not liue .
Then hee turned his face to the wall , and prayed vnto the Lord , saying ;
I beseech thee , O Lord , remember now how I haue walked before thee in trueth , and with a perfect heart , and haue done that which is good in thy sight : and Hezekiah wept sore .
And it came to passe afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying :
Turne againe , and tell Hezekiah the captaine of my people , Thus saith the Lord , the God of Dauid thy father , I haue heard thy prayer , I haue seene thy teares : behold , I will heale thee ; on the third day thou shalt goe vp vnto the house of the Lord .
And I will adde vnto thy dayes fifteene yeeres , and I will deliuer thee , and this city , out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this citie for mine owne sake , and for my seruant Dauids sake .
And Isaiah said , Take a lumpe of figs . And they tooke and layd it on the boile , and he recouered .
¶ And Hezekiah said vnto Isaiah , What shall bee the signe that the Lord wil heale me , and that I shall goe vp into the house of the Lord the third day ? And Isaiah said , This signe shalt thou haue of the Lord , that the Lord will doe the thing that hee hath spoken : shall the shadow goe forward ten degrees , or goe backe tenne degrees ?
And Hezekiah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go downe tenne degrees : nay , but let the shadow returne backward tenne degrees .
And Isaiah the Prophet cryed vnto the Lord , and he brought the shadow tenne degrees backeward , by which it had gone downe in the diall of Ahaz .
¶ At that time Berodach - Baladan the sonne of Baladan King of Babylon , sent letters and a present vnto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had beene sicke .
And Hezekiah hearkened vnto them , and shewed them the house of his precious things , the siluer , and the golde , and the spices , and the precious oyntment , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found in his treasures : there was nothing in his house , nor in all his dominion , that Hezekiah shewed them not .
¶ Then came Isaiah the Prophet vnto King Hezekiah , and sayde vnto him , What sayd these men ? and from whence came they vnto thee ? And Hezekiah sayde , They are come from a farre countrey , euen from Babylon .
And he said , What haue they seene in thine house ? And Hezekiah answered , All the things that are in mine house haue they seene : there is nothing among my treasures , that I haue not shewed them .
And Isaiah said vnto Hezekiah , Heare the word of the Lord .
Behold , the dayes come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers haue layde vp in store vnto this day , shall be caried vnto Babylon : nothing shall be left , sayth the Lord .
And of thy sonnes that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away , and they shall bee Eunuches in the palace of the king of Babylon .
Then said Hezekiah vnto Isaiah , Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken . And he said , Is it not good , if peace and trueth be in my dayes ?

Manasseh was twelue yeres olde when hee beganne to reigne , and reigned fiftie and fiue yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Hephzibah .
And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
For he built vp againe the high places , which Hezekiah his father had destroyed , and hee reared vp altars for Baal , and made a groue , as did Ahab king of Israel , and worshipped all the hoste of heauen , and serued them .
And he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord sayd , In Ierusalem will I put my Name .
And he built altars for all the host of heauen , in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
And he made his sonne passe thorow the fire , and obserued times , and vsed enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits , and wizards : he wrought much wickednesse in the sight of the Lord , to prouoke him to anger .
And he set a grauen image of the groue that he had made , in the house , of which the Lord said to Dauid , and to Solomon his sonne , In this house and in Ierusalem , which I haue chosen out of all tribes of Israel , wil I put my Name for euer :
Neither will I make the feete of Israel mooue any more out of the land , which I gaue their fathers : onely if they will obserue to doe according to all that I haue commanded them , and according to all the Law , that my seruant Moses commanded them .
But they hearkened not : and Manasseh seduced them to doe more euill then did the nations , whome the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel .
¶ And the Lord spake by his seruants the Prophets , saying ,
Because Manasseh king of Iudah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly aboue all that the Amorites did , which were before him , and hath made Iudah also to sinne with his idoles :
Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Behold , I am bringing such euill vpon Ierusalem and Iudah , that whosoeuer heareth of it , both his eares shall tingle .
And I will stretch ouer Ierusalem the line of Samaria , and the plummet of the house of Ahab : and I will wipe Ierusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wiping it and turning it vpside downe .
And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliuer them into the hand of their enemies , and they shall become a pray and a spoile to all their enemies ,
Because they haue done that which was euill in my sight , and haue prouoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , euen vnto this day .
Moreouer , Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled Ierusalem from one end to another , beside his sinne wherwith he made Iudah to sinne , in doing that which was euill in the sight of the Lord .
¶ Now the rest of the actes of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sinne that he sinned , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
And Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his owne house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his sonne reigned in his stead .
¶ Amon was twentie and two yeres old when he began to reigne , and he reigned two yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Iotbah .
And he did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , as his father Manasseh did .
And he walked in all the wayes that his father walked in , and serued the idoles that his father serued , and worshipped them :
And he forsooke the Lord God of his fathers , and walked not in the way of the Lord .
¶ And the seruants of Amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his owne house .
And the people of the land slew al them that had conspired against king Amon , and the people of the land made Iosiah his sonne king in his stead .
Now the rest of the acts of Amon , which he did , are they not written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?

Iosiah was eight yeeres old when hee beganne to reigne , and hee reigned thirtie and one yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Iedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath .
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the wayes of Dauid his father , and turned not aside to the right hand , or to the left .
¶ And it came to passe in the eighteenth yeere of king Iosiah , that the king sent Shaphan the sonne of Azaliah , the sonne of Meshullam the Scribe to the house of the Lord , saying ,
Goe vp to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may summe the siluer which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the doore haue gathered of the people .
And let them deliuer it into the hand of the doers of the worke , that haue the ouersight of the house of the Lord : and let them giue it to the doers of the worke , which is in the house of the Lord , to repaire the breaches of the house ,
Unto carpenters , and builders , and masons , and to buy timber and hewen stone , to repaire the house .
Howbeit , there was no reckoning made with them , of the money that was deliuered into their hand , because they dealt faithfully .
¶ And Hilkiah the high Priest said vnto Shaphan the Scribe , I haue found the booke of the Law in the house of the Lord . And Hilkiah gaue the booke to Shaphan , and he read it .
And Shaphan the Scribe came to the king , and brought the king word againe , and said , Thy seruants haue gathered the money that was found in the house , and haue deliuered it into the hand of them that doe the worke , that haue the ouersight of the house of the Lord .
And Shaphan the Scribe shewed the king , saying , Hilkiah the Priest hath deliuered mee a booke : and Shaphan read it before the king .
And it came to passe when the king had heard the words of the booke of the Law , that he rent his clothes .
And the king commanded Hilkiah the Priest , and Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan , and Achbor the sonne of Michaiah , and Shaphan the Scribe , and Asahiah a seruant of the Kings , saying ,
Goe yee , enquire of the Lord for me , and for the people , and for all Iudah , concerning the wordes of this booke that is found : for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against vs , because our fathers haue not hearkened vnto the woordes of this booke , to doe according vnto all that which is written concerning vs .
So Hilkiah the Priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asahiah , went vnto Huldah the Prophetesse , the wife of Shallum the sonne of Tikuah , the sonne of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe : now she dwelt in Ierusalem in the colledge : And they communed with her .
¶ And she said vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Tell the man that sent you to me ;
Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will bring euill vpon this place , and vpon the inhabitants thereof , euen all the words of the booke which the king of Iudah hath read .
Because they haue forsaken me , and haue burnt incense vnto other gods , that they might prouoke mee to anger with all the woorkes of their handes : therefore my wrath shall bee kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched . But to the king of Iudah which sent you to enquire of the Lord , Thus shall yee say to him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , as touching the woordes which thou hast heard :
Because thine heart was tender , and thou hast humbled thy selfe before the Lord , when thou heardest what I spake against this place , and against the inhabitants thereof , that they should become a desolation and a curse , and hast rent thy cloathes , and wept before me ; I also haue heard thee , saith the Lord .

And the king sent , and they gathered vnto him all the Elders of Iudah , and of Ierusalem .
And the king went vp into the house of the Lord , and all the men of Iudah , and all the inhabitants of Ierusalem with him , and the Priestes , and the Prophets , and all the people both small and great : and he read in their eares all the wordes of the booke of the Couenant which was found in the house of the Lord .
¶ And the King stood by a pillar , and made a Couenant before the Lord , to walke after the Lord , and to keepe his Commaundements , and his Testimonies , & his Statutes , with all their heart , and all their soule , to performe the words of this Couenant , that were written in this booke : and all the people stood to the Couenant .
And the king commanded Hilkiah the high Priest , and the priests of the second order , and the keepers of the doore to bring forth out of the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal , and for the groue , and for all the hoste of heauen : and he burnt them without Ierusalem in the fields of Kidron , and caried the ashes of them vnto Bethel .
And hee put downe the idolatrous priests whome the kings of Iudah had ordeined to burne incense in the high places , in the cities of Iudah and in the places round about Ierusalem : them also that burnt incense vnto Baal , to the Sunne , and to the Moone , and to the Planets , and to all the hoste of heauen .
And he brought out the groue from the house of the Lord , without Ierusalem , vnto the brooke Kidron , and burnt it at the brooke Kidron , and stampt it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof vpon the graues of the children of the people .
And he brake downe the houses of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord , where the women woue hangings for the groue .
And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Iudah , and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense , from Geba to Beersheba , and brake downe the hie places of the gates that were in the entring in of the gate of Ioshua the gouernour of the citie , which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the citie .
Neuerthelesse , the priests of the high places came not vp to the Altar of the Lord in Ierusalem , but they did eate of the vnleauened bread among their brethren .
And he defiled Topheth which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his sonne or his daughter to passe through the fire to Molech .
And he tooke away the horses that the kings of Iudah had giuen to the Sunne , at the entring in of the house of the Lord , by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlaine , which was in the suburbs , and burnt the charets of the Sunne with fire ,
And the altars that were on the top of the vpper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Iudah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat downe , and brake them downe from thence , and cast the dust of them into the brooke Kidron .
And the high places that were before Ierusalem , which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption , which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth , the abomination of the Zidonians , and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites , and for Milchom the abomination of the children of Ammon , did the king defile .
And he brake in pieces the images , and cut downe the groues , and filled their places with the bones of men .
¶ Moreouer the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat , who made Israel to sinne , had made , both that altar , and the high place he brake downe , and burnt the high place , and stampt it small to powder , and burnt the groue .
And as Iosiah turned himselfe , he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount , and sent , & tooke the bones out of the sepulchres , and burnt them vpon the altar , and polluted it , according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
Then hee said , What title is that that I see ? and the men of the city told him , It is the sepulchre of the man of God , which came from Iudah , and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel .
And he said , Let him alone : let no man moue his bones : so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the Prophet that came out of Samaria .
And all the houses also of the hie places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to prouoke the Lord to anger , Iosiah tooke away , and did to them according to all the actes that hee had done in Bethel .
And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there , vpon the altars , and burnt mens bones vpon them , and returned to Ierusalem .
¶ And the King commanded all the people saying , Keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord your God , as it is written in this booke of the Couenant .
Surely there was not holden such a Passeouer , from the daies of the Iudges that iudged Israel , nor in all the dayes of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Iudah :
But in the eighteenth yeere of king Iosiah , wherein this Passeouer was holden to the Lord in Ierusalem .
¶ Moreouer the workers with familiar spirits , and the wizards , and the images , and the idoles , and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Iudah , and in Ierusalem , did Iosiah put away , that he might performe the wordes of the lawe , which were written in the booke that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord .
And like vnto him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his soule , and with all his might , according to all the Law of Moses , neither after him arose there any like him .
¶ Notwithstanding , the Lord turned not from the fiercenesse of his great wrath , wherwith his anger was kindled against Iudah , because of all the prouocations that Manasseh had prouoked him withall .
And the Lord said , I will remoue Iudah also out of my sight , as I haue remoued Israel , and will cast off this citie Ierusalem , which I haue chosen , and the house of which I sayd , My name shall be there .
Now the rest of the actes of Iosiah , and all that hee did , are they not written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Iudah ?
¶ In his dayes , Pharaoh Nechoh king of Egypt , went vp against the king of Assyria to the riuer Euphrates : and king Iosiah went against him , and hee slew him at Megiddo , when he had seene him .
And his seruants caried him in a charet dead from Megiddo , & brought him to Ierusalem , and buried him in his owne sepulchre : and the people of the land tooke Iehoahaz the sonne of Iosiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his fathers stead .
¶ Iehoahaz was twenty and three yeeres olde when he beganne to reigne , and hee reigned three moneths in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Hamital , the daughter of Ieremiah , of Libnah .
And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
And Pharaoh Nechoh put him in bandes at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reigne in Ierusalem , and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of siluer , and a talent of golde .
And Pharaoh Nechoh made Eliakim the sonne of Iosiah king , in the roume of Iosiah his father , and turned his name to Iehoiakim , and tooke Iehoahaz away : and hee came to Egypt , and died there .
And Iehoiakim gaue the siluer , and the golde to Pharaoh , but he taxed the land to giue the money according to the commandement of Pharaoh : hee exacted the siluer and the golde of the people of the land , of euery one according to his taxation , to giue it vnto Pharaoh Nechoh .
¶ Iehoiakim was twentie and fiue yeere olde when he began to reigne , and he reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .

In his dayes Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came vp , and Iehoiakim became his seruant three yeeres : then hee turned and rebelled against him .
And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees , and bandes of the Syrians , and bandes of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Iudah to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which hee spake by his seruants the Prophets .
Surely at the commandement of the Lord came this vpon Iudah , to remooue them out of his sight , for the sinnes of Manasseh , according to all that he did :
So Iehoiakim slept with his fathers : and Iehoiachin his sonne reigned in his stead .
And the king of Egypt came not againe any more out of his land : for the King of Babylon had taken from the riuer of Egypt , vnto the riuer Euphrates , all that pertained to the King of Egypt .
¶ Iehoiachin was eighteene yeres old when he began to reigne , & he reigned in Ierusalem three moneths : & his mothers name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan , of Ierusalem .
And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father had done . ¶ At that time the seruants of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came vp against Ierusalem , and the citie was besieged .
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the citie , and his seruants did besiege it .
And Iehoiachin the King of Iudah went out to the king of Babylon , hee , and his mother , and his seruants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon tooke him in the eight yeere of his reigne .
And he caried away Iehoiachin to Babylon , and the kings mother , and the kings wiues , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those caried hee into captiuitie , from Ierusalem to Babylon .
And all the men of might , euen seuen thousand , and craftesmen , & smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for warre , euen them the king of Babylon brought captiue to Babylon .
¶ And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his fathers brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twentie and one yeeres olde when hee began to reigne , and he reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem : and his mothers name was Hamutal , the daughter of Ieremiah of Libnah .

And the citie was besieged vnto the eleuenth yeere of king Zedekiah .
And on the ninth day of the fourth moneth , the famine preuailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
¶ And the citie was broken vp , and all the men of warre fled by night , by the way of the gate , betweene two walles , which is by the kings garden , ( now the Caldees were against the citie round about ) and the King went the way toward the plaine .
And the army of the Caldees pursued after the King , and ouertooke him in the plaines of Iericho : and all his armie were scattered from him .
So they tooke the King , and brought him vp to the King of Babylon , to Riblah , and they gaue iudgement vpon him .
And they slew the sonnes of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brasse , and carried him to Babylon .
¶ And in the fifth moneth , on the seuenth day of the moneth ( which is the nineteenth yeere of King Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon ) came Nebuzaradan captaine of the guard , a seruant of the king of Babylon , vnto Ierusalem :
And hee burnt the house of the Lord , and the kings house , and all the houses of Ierusalem , and euery great mans house burnt he with fire .
And all the army of the Caldees that were with the captaine of the guard , brake downe the walles of Ierusalem round about .
Now the rest of the people that were left in the citie , and the fugitiues that fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard cary away .
And the pots , and the shouels , and the snuffers , and the spoones , and all the vessels of brasse wherewith they ministred , tooke they away .
And out of the citie hee tooke an Officer , that was set ouer the men of warre , and fiue men of them that were in the kings presence , which were found in the citie , and the principall Scribe of the hoste , which mustered the people of the land , and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the citie .
And Nebuzaradan captaine of the guard tooke these , and brought them to the king of Babylon , to Riblah .
And the King of Babylon smote them , and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath : so Iudah was caried away out of their land .
¶ And as for the people that remained in the land of Iudah , whom Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon had left , euen ouer them he made Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam , the sonne of Shaphan , ruler .
And when all the captaines of the armies , they , and their men , heard that the King of Babylon had made Gedaliah gouernour , there came to Gedaliah to Mispah , euen Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , and Iohanan the sonne of Careah , and Seraiah the sonne of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Iaazaniah the sonne of a Maachathite , they , and their men .
And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men , and said vnto them , Feare not to be the seruants of the Caldees : dwell in the land , and serue the King of Babylon ; and it shall bee well with you .
But it came to passe in the seuenth moneth , that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , the sonne of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Iewes , and the Caldees that were with him at Mizpah .
And all the people both small and great , and the captaines of the armies arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Caldees .
¶ And it came to passe in the seuen and thirtieth yeere of the captiuitie of Iehoiachin king of Iudah , in the twelfth moneth , on the seuen and twentieth day of the moneth , that Euilmerodach king of Babylon , in the yeere that he began to reigne , did lift vp the head of Iehoiachin king of Iudah out of prison .
And he spake kindly to him , and set his throne aboue the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon ,
And changed his prison garments : and he did eate bread continually before him all the dayes of his life .

For wee haue not followed cunningly deuised fables , when wee made knowen vnto you the power and comming of our Lord Iesus Christ , but were eye witnesses of his Maiestie .
For hee receiued from God the Father , honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased .
And this voice which came from heauen wee heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
We haue also a more sure word of prophecie , whereunto yee doe well that ye take heede , as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place , vntill the day dawne , and the day starre arise in your hearts :
Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any priuate Interpretation :
<NON-VERSE>
But there were false prophets also among the people , euen as there shall bee false teachers among you , who priuily shall bring in damnable heresies , euen denying the Lord that bought them , and bring vpon themselues swift destruction .
And many shall follow their pernicious wayes , by reason of whom the way of trueth shall be euill spoken of :
And through couetousnesse shall they with fained words , make marchandise of you , whose iudgement now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbreth not .
For if God spared not the Angels that sinned , but cast them downe to hell , and deliuered them into chaines of darkenesse , to be reserued vnto iudgment :
And spared not the old world , but saued Noah the eight person a preacher of righteousnesse , bringing in the flood vpon the world of the vngodly :
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes , condemned them with an ouerthrowe , making them an ensample vnto those that after should liue vngodly :
And deliuered iust Lot , vexed with the filthy conuersation of the wicked :
( For that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing & hearing , vexed his righteous soule from day to day , with their vnlawfull deeds . )
The Lord knoweth how to deliuer the godly out of temptations , and to reserue the vniust vnto the day of iudgement to be punished :
But chiefly them that walke after the flesh in the lust of vncleannesse , and despise gouernment . Presumptuous are they ; selfe willed : they are not afraid to speake euill of dignities :
Whereas Angels which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord .
But these , as natural bruit beasts made to bee taken and destroyed speake euill of the things that they vnderstand not , and shall vtterly perish in their owne corruption ,
And shall receiue the reward of vnrighteousnesse , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time : Spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselues with their owne deceiuings , while they feast with you :
Hauing eyes ful of adulterie and that cannot cease from sinne , beguiling vnstable soules : an heart they haue exercised with couetous practises : cursed children :
Which haue forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the sonne of Bosor , who loued the wages of vnrighteousnesse ,
But was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumbe asse speaking with mais voice , forbade the madnesse of the Prophet .
While they promise them libertie , they themselues are the seruants of corruption : for of whom a man is ouercome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
For if after they haue escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ , they are againe intangled therein , and ouercome , the latter end is worse with them then the beginning .
For it had bin better for them not to haue knowen the way of righteousnesse , then after they haue knowen it , to turne from the holy commandement deliuered vnto them .

This second Epistle ( beloued ) I now write vnto you , in both which I stir vp your pure mindes by way of remembrance :
That yee may be mindfull of the wordes which were spoken before by the holy Prophets , and of the Commandement of vs the Apostles of the Lord and Sauiour :
Knowing this first , that there shall come in the last dayes scoffers , walking after their owne lusts ,
And saying , Where is the promise of his comming ? For since the fathers fell asleepe , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heauens were of olde , and the earth standing out of the water , and in the water ,
Whereby the world that then was , being ouerflowed with water , perished .
But the heauens and the earth which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserued vnto fire against the day of Iudgement , and perdition of vngodly men .
But ( beloued ) bee not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand yeeres , and a thousand yeeres as one day .
The Lord is not slacke concerning his promise ( as some men count slacknesse ) but is long - suffring to vs - ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
But the day of the Lord wil come as a thiefe in the night , in the which the heauens shall passe away with a great noise , and the Elements shall melt with feruent heate , the earth also and the works that are therin shalbe burnt vp .
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolued , What maner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conuersation , and godlinesse ,
Looking for and hasting vnto the comming of the day of God , wherein the heauens being on fire shalbe dissolued , and the Elements shall melt with feruent heat .
Neuerthelesse wee , according to his promise , looke for new heauens , and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousnesse .
Wherefore ( beloued ) seeing that ye looke for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blamelesse .
And account that the long suffering of the Lord is saluation , euen as our beloued brother Paul also , according to the wisedome giuen vnto him , hath written vnto you .
As also in all his Epistles , speaking in them of these things , in which are some things hard to be vnderstood , which they that are vnlearned and vnstable wrest , as they doe also the other Scriptures , vnto their owne destruction .
Ye therefore , beloued , seeing yee know these things before , beware lest yee also being led away with the errour of the wicked , fall from your owne stedfastnesse .

Now it came to passe after the death of Saul , when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and Dauid had abode two daies in Ziklag ,
It came euen to passe on the third day , that behold , a man came out of the campe from Saul , with his clothes rent , and earth vpon his head : and so it was when he came to Dauid , that hee fell to the earth , and did obeysance .
And Dauid said vnto him , From whence commest thou ? And he said vnto him , Out of the campe of Israel am I escaped .
And Dauid said vnto him , How went the matter ? I pray thee , tell mee . And he answered , That the people are fled from the battell , and many of the people also are fallen and dead , and Saul and Ionathan his sonne are dead also .
And Dauid said vnto the yong man that told him , How knowest thou that Saul and Ionathan his sonne be dead ?
And the yong man that told him , said , As I happened by chance vpon mount Gilboa , behold , Saul leaned vpon his speare : and loe , the charets and horsemen followed hard after him .
And when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called vnto mee : and I answered , Here am I .
And hee said vnto mee , Who art thou ? and I answered him , I am an Amalekite .
He said vnto me againe , Stand , I pray thee , vpon me , and slay me : for anguish is come vpon mee , because my life is yet whole in me .
So I stood vpon him , and slew him , because I was sure that hee could not liue after that hee was fallen : And I tooke the crowne that was vpon his head , and the bracelet that was on his arme , and haue brought them hither vnto my lord .
Then Dauid tooke hold on his clothes , and rent them , and likewise all the men that were with him .
And they mourned and wept , and fasted vntill Euen , for Saul and for Ionathan his sonne , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel , because they were fallen by the sword .
¶ And Dauid said vnto the yong man that told him , Whence art thou ? And he answered , I am the sonne of a stranger , an Amalekite .
And Dauid said vnto him , How wast thou not afraid to stretch foorth thine hand , to destroy the Lords Anointed ?
And Dauid called one of the yong men , and sayd , Goe neere , and fall vpon him . And hee smote him , that hee dyed .
And Dauid said vnto him , Thy blood be vpon thy head : for thy mouth hath testified against thee , saying , I haue slaine the Lords Annoynted .
¶ And Dauid lamented with this lamentation ouer Saul , and ouer Ionathan his sonne :
( Also hee bade them teach the children of Iudah the vse of the bow : behold , it is written in the booke of Iasher . )
The beauty of Israel is slaine vpon thy high places : how are the mightie fallen !
Tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streetes of Askelon : lest the daughters of the Philistines reioyce , lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph .
Yee mountaines of Gilboa , let there bee no dewe , neither let there be raine vpon you , nor fields of offerings : for there the shield of the mightie is vilely cast away , the shield of Saul , as though hee had not beene annointed with oile .
From the blood of the slaine , from the fat of the mightie , the bow of Ionathan turned not backe , and the sword of Saul returned not emptie .
Saul and Ionathan were louely and pleasant in their liues , and in their death they were not diuided : they were swifter then Eagles , they were stronger then Lions .
Yee daughters of Israel , weepe ouer Saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of golde vpon your apparell .
How are the mightie fallen in the midst of the battell ! O Ionathan , thou wast slaine in thine high places .
I am distressed for thee , my brother Ionathan , very pleasant hast thou beene vnto mee : thy loue to mee was wonderfull , passing the loue of women .

And it came to passe after this , that Dauid enquired of the Lord , saying , Shall I goe vp into any of the Cities of Iudah ? And the Lord said vnto him , Goe vp . And Dauid said , Whither shall I goe vp ? And he said , Unto Hebron .
So Dauid went vp thither , and his two wiues also , Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse , and Abigail Nabals wife the Carmelite .
And his men that were with him , did Dauid bring vp , euery man with his houshold : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
And the men of Iudah came , and there they anointed Dauid king ouer the house of Iudah : and they tolde Dauid , saying ; That the men of Iabesh Gilead were they that buried Saul .
¶ And Dauid sent messengers vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead , and said vnto them , Blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye haue shewed this kindnesse vnto your lord , euen vnto Saul , and haue buried him .
And now the Lord shewe kindnesse and trueth vnto you : and I also will requite you this kindnesse , because ye haue done this thing .
Therefore now let your handes be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Iudah haue anointed me king ouer them .
¶ But Abner the sonne of Ner , captaine of Sauls hoste , tooke Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul , and brought him ouer to Mahanaim .
And hee made him king ouer Gilead , and ouer the Ashurites , and ouer Iezreel , and ouer Ephraim , and ouer Beniamin , and ouer all Israel .
Ishbosheth Sauls sonne was fortie yeeres olde when he began to reigne ouer Israel , and reigned two yeres : but the house of Iudah followed Dauid .
( And the time that Dauid was King in Hebron ouer the house of Iudah , was seuen yeeres , and sixe moneths )
¶ And Abner the sonne of Ner , and the seruants of Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul , went out from Mahanaim , to Gibeon .
And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah , and the seruants of Dauid went out , and met together by the poole of Gibeon : and they sate downe , the one on the one side of the poole , and the other on the other side of the poole .
And Abner said to Ioab , Let the yong men now arise , and play before vs : and Ioab saide , Let them arise .
Then there arose and went ouer by number twelue of Beniamin , which pertained to Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul , and twelue of the seruants of Dauid .
And they caught euery one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellowes side , so they fell downe together : Wherfore that place was called Helkath - hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
And there was a very sore battell that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the seruants of Dauid .
¶ And there were three sonnes of Zeruiah there , Ioab , and Abishai , and Asahel : and Asahel was as light of foot as a wilde Roe .
And Asahel pursued after Abner , and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
Then Abner looked behind him , and said , Art thou Asahel ? And he answered , I am .
And Abner said to him , Turne thee aside to thy right hand , or to thy left , and lay thee holde on one of the yong men , and take thee his armour . But Asahel would not turne aside from following of him .
And Abner said againe to Asahel , Turne thee aside from following me : Wherefore should I smite thee to the ground ? how then should I holde vp my face to Ioab thy brother ?
Howbeit he refused to turne aside : wherefore Abner with the hinder ende of the speare smote him vnder the fift ribbe , that the speare came out behinde him , and hee fell downe there , and died in the same place : and it came to passe , that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell downe and died , stood still .
Ioab also and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the Sunne went downe when they were come to the hill of Ammah , that lieth before Giah by the way of the wildernesse of Gibeon .
¶ And the children of Beniamin gathered themselues together after Abner , and became one troupe , and stood on the top of an hill .
Then Abner called to Ioab , and said , Shall the sword deuoure for euer ? Knowest thou not that it wil be bitternesse in the latter end ? How long shall it bee then , yer thou bid the people returne from following their brethren ?
And Ioab said , As God liueth , vnlesse thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone vp euery one from following his brother .
So Ioab blew a trumpet , and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
And Abner and his men walked all that night thorow the plaine , and passed ouer Iordane , and went thorow all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
And Ioab returned from folowing Abner ; and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of Dauids seruants nineteene men , and Asahel .
But the seruants of Dauid had smitten of Beniamin and of Abners men , so that three hundred and threescore men died .
<NON-VERSE>
Now there was long war betweene the house of Saul , and the house of Dauid : but Dauid waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker .
¶ And vnto Dauid were sonnes borne in Hebron : and his first borne was Ammon , of Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse .
And his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite : and the third , Absalom the sonne of Maacah , the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
And the fourth , Adoniiah the son of Haggith : and the fifth , Shephatiah the sonne of Abital ;
And the sixth , Ithream by Eglah Dauids wife : these were borne to Dauid in Hebron .
¶ And it came to passe while there was warre between the house of Saul and the house of Dauid , that Abner made himselfe strong for the house of Saul .
And Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah : and Ishbosheth saide to Abner , Wherefore hast thou gone in vnto my fathers concubine ?
Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth , and said , Am I a dogs head , which against Iudah doe shew kindnesse this day vnto the house of Saul thy father , to his brethren , and to his friends , and haue not deliuered thee into the hand of Dauid , that thou chargest mee to day with a fault concerning this woman ?
So doe God to Abner , and more also , except , as the Lord hath sworne to Dauid , euen so I doe to him :
To translate the kingdome from the house of Saul , and to set vp the throne of Dauid ouer Israel , and ouer Iudah , from Dan euen to Beer - sheba .
And he could not answere Abner a word againe , because he feared him .
¶ And Abner sent messengers to Dauid on his behalfe , saying , Whose is the land ? saying also , Make thy league with me , and behold , my hand shall bee with thee , to bring about all Israel vnto thee .
¶ And he said , Well , I will make a league with thee : but one thing I require of thee , that is , Thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring Michal Sauls daughter , when thou commest to see my face .
And Dauid sent messengers to Ishbosheth Sauls sonne , saying , Deliuer mee my wife Michal , which I espoused to mee for an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistines .
And Ishbosheth sent , and tooke her from her husband , euen from Phaltiel the sonne of Laish .
And her husband went with her along weeping behinde her to Bahurim : then said Abner vnto him , Goe , returne . And he returned .
¶ And Abner had communication with the Elders of Israel , saying , Yee sought for Dauid in times past , to be king ouer you .
Now then doe it , for the Lord hath spoken of Dauid , saying ; By the hand of my seruant Dauid I will saue my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies .
And Abner also spake in the eares of Beniamin : and Abner went also to speake in the eares of Dauid in Hebron , all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Beniamin .
So Abner came to Dauid to Hebron , and twenty men with him : and Dauid made Abner , and the men that were with him , a feast .
And Abner said vnto Dauid , I will arise , and goe , and will gather all Israel vnto my lord the king , that they may make a league with thee , and that thou mayest raigne ouer all that thine heart desireth . And Dauid sent Abner away , and he went in peace .
¶ And behold , the seruants of Dauid , and Ioab came from pursuing a troupe , and brought in a great spoile with them : ( but Abner was not with Dauid in Hebron , for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace . )
When Ioab and all the host that was with him , were come , they told Ioab , saying , Abner the sonne of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
Then Ioab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ? behold , Abner came vnto thee , why is it that thou hast sent him away , & he is quite gone ?
Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner , that he came to deceiue thee , and to know thy going out , and thy comming in , & to know all that thou doest .
And when Ioab was come out from Dauid , hee sent messengers after Abner , which brought him againe from the well of Siriah ; but Dauid knew it not .
And when Abner was returned to Hebron , Ioab tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him quietly : and smote him there vnder the fift ribbe , that he died , for the blood of Asahel his brother .
¶ And afterward when Dauid heard it , hee said , I and my kingdome are guiltlesse before the Lord for euer , from the blood of Abner the sonne of Ner :
Let it rest on the head of Ioab , and on all his fathers house , & let there not faile from the house of Ioab one that hath an issue , or that is a leper , or that leaneth on a staffe , or that falleth on the sword , or that lacketh bread .
So Ioab and Abishai his brother slew Abner , because he had slaine their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battell .
¶ And Dauid said to Ioab , and to all the people that were with him , Rent your clothes , and girde you with sackecloth , and mourne before Abner . And king Dauid himselfe followed the biere .
And they buried Abner in Hebron , and the king lift vp his voice , and wept at the graue of Abner ; and all the people wept .
And the king lamented ouer Abner , and said , Died Abner as a foole dieth ?
Thy hands were not bound , nor thy feete put into fetters : as a man falleth before wicked men , so fellest thou . And all the people wept againe ouer him .
And when all the people came to cause Dauid to eate meate while it was yet day , Dauid sware , saying , So doe God to mee , and more also , if I taste bread or ought else , till the Sunne be downe .
And all the people tooke notice of it , and it pleased them : as whatsoeuer the King did , pleased all the people .
For all the people , and all Israel vnderstood that day , that it was not of the King to slay Abner the sonne of Ner .
And the King said vnto his seruants , Knowe yee not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ?
<NON-VERSE>
And when Sauls sonne heard that Abner was dead in Hebron , his hands were feeble , and all the Israelites were troubled .
And Sauls sonne had two men that were captaines of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sonnes of Rimmon a Beerothite , of the children of Beniamin : ( for Beeroth also was reckoned to Beniamin :
And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim , and were soiourners there vntill this day . )
And Ionathan , Sauls sonne , had a sonne that was lame of his feete , and was fiue yeeres olde when the tidings came of Saul and Ionathan out of Iezreel , and his nource tooke him vp , and fled : and it came to passe as she made haste to flee , that hee fell , and became lame , and his name was Mephibosheth .
And the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , who lay on a bed at noone .
And they came thither into the midst of the house , as though they would haue fetched wheat , and they smote him vnder the fift rib , and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
For when they came into the house , hee lay on his bedde in his bedchamber , and they smote him , and slew him , and beheaded him , and tooke his head , and gate them away thorow the plaine all night .
And they brought the head of Ishbosheth vnto Dauid to Hebron , and said to the King , Behold the head of Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul , thine enemie , which sought thy life , and the Lord hath auenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed .
¶ And Dauid answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said vnto them , As the Lord liueth , who hath redeemed my soule out of all aduersitie ,
When one told me , saying , Behold , Saul is dead , ( thinking to haue brought good tidings ) I tooke hold of him , and slew him in Ziklag , who thought that I would haue giuen him a reward for his tidings :
How much more , when wicked men haue slaine a righteous person , in his owne house , vpon his bed ? Shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then came all the tribes of Israel to Dauid vnto Hebron , and spake , saying , Behold , we are thy bone , and thy flesh .
Also in time past when Saul was king ouer vs , thou wast hee that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord said to thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt bee a captaine ouer Israel .
So all the Elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron , and King Dauid made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord : and they anointed Dauid King ouer Israel .
¶ Dauid was thirtie yeeres old when he began to reigne , and he reigned fourtie yeeres .
In Hebron he reigned ouer Iudah seuen yeeres , and sixe moneths : and in Ierusalem he reigned thirty and three yeres ouer all Israel and Iudah .
¶ And the king and his men went to Ierusalem , vnto the Iebusites , the inhabitants of the land : which spake vnto Dauid , saying , Except thou take away the blind and the lame , thou shalt not come in hither : Thinking , Dauid cannot come in hither .
Neuerthelesse , Dauid tooke the strong hold of Zion : the same is the citie of Dauid .
And Dauid said on that day , Whosoeuer getteth vp to the gutter , and smiteth the Iebusites , and the lame , and the blind , that are hated of Dauids soule , he shall be chiefe and captaine : Wherefore they said , The blind and the lame shall not come into the house .
So Dauid dwelt in the fort , and called it the citie of Dauid , and Dauid built round about , from Millo and inward .
And Dauid went on , and grew great , and the Lord God of hosts was with him .
¶ And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid , and Cedar trees , and carpenters , and Masons : and they built Dauid an house .
And Dauid perceiued that the Lord had established him King ouer Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdome for his people Israels sake .
¶ And Dauid tooke him mo concubines and wiues out of Ierusalem , after he was come from Hebron , and there were yet sonnes and daughters borne to Dauid .
And these be the names of those that were borne vnto him in Ierusalem , Shammua , & Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon : Ibhar also , and Elishua , and Nepheg , and Iaphia ,
And Elishama , and Eliada , and Eliphalet .
¶ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed Dauid King ouer Israel , all the Philistines came vp to seeke Dauid , and Dauid heard of it , and went downe to the hold .
The Philistines also came , and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim .
And Dauid enquired of the Lord , saying , Shall I goe vp to the Philistines ? wilt thou deliuer them into mine hand ? And the Lord said vnto Dauid , Goe vp : for I will doubtlesse deliuer the Philistines into thine hand .
And Dauid came to Baal - Perazim , and Dauid smote them there , and said , The Lord hath broken foorth vpon mine enemies before me , as the breach of waters . Therefore he called the name of that place , Baal - Perazim .
And there they left their images , and Dauid and his men burnt them .
¶ And the Philistines came vp yet againe , and spread themselues in the valley of Rephaim .
And when Dauid enquired of the Lord , he said , Thou shalt not goe vp : but fetch a compasse behinde them , and come vpon them ouer against the Mulbery trees .
And let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulbery trees , that then thou shalt bestirre thy selfe : for then shal the Lord goe out before thee , to smite the host of the Philistines .
<NON-VERSE>
Againe , Dauid gathered together all the chosen men of Israel , thirtie thousand :
And Dauid arose and went with all the people that were with him , from Baale of Iudah , to bring vp from thence the Arke of God , whose Name is called by the Name of the Lord of hostes , that dwelleth betweene the Cherubims . And they set the Arke of God vpon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio the sonnes of Abinadab , draue the new cart .
And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah , accompanying the Arke of God ; and Ahio went before the Arke .
And Dauid and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of Firrewood , euen on harpes , and on Psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cimbals . ¶ And when they came to Nachons threshing floore , Uzzah put forth his hand to the Arke of God , and tooke hold of it , for the oxen shooke it .
And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah , and God smote him there for his errour , and there he died by the Arke of God .
And Dauid was displeased , because the Lord had made a breach vpon Uzzah : And hee called the name of the place , Perez - Uzzah to this day .
And Dauid was afraide of the Lord that day , and said , How shall the Arke of the Lord come to me ?
So Dauid would not remoue the Arke of the Lord vnto him into the citie of Dauid : but Dauid caried it aside into the house of Obed Edom , the Gittite .
And the Arke of the Lord continued in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite , three moneths : and the Lord blessed Obed Edom , and all his household .
¶ And it was told king Dauid , saying , The Lord hath blessed the house of Obed Edom , and all that pertained vnto him , because of the Arke of God . So Dauid went , and brought vp the Arke of God , from the house of Obed Edom , into the citie of Dauid , with gladnesse .
And it was so , that when they that bare the Arke of the Lord , had gone sixe paces , hee sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
And Dauid daunced before the Lord with all his might , and Dauid was girded with a linnen Ephod .
So Dauid and all the house of Israel brought vp the Arke of the Lord with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
And as the Arke of the Lord came into the citie of Dauid , Michal Sauls daughter looked through a window , and saw king Dauid leaping and dauncing before the Lord , and she despised him in her heart . ¶ And they brought in the Arke of the Lord , and set it in his place , in the midst of the Tabernacle that Dauid had pitched for it : and Dauid offered burnt offerings , and peace offrings before the Lord .
And assoone as Dauid had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , hee blessed the people in the Name of the Lord of hostes .
And hee dealt among all the people , euen among the whole multitude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to euery one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine : so all the people departed euery one to his house .
¶ Then Dauid returned to blesse his houshold : and Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meete Dauid , and said , How glorious was the King of Israel to day , who vncouered himselfe to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his seruants , as one of the vaine fellowes shamelessely vncouereth himselfe !
And Dauid said vnto Michal , It was before the Lord , which chose me before thy father , & before all his house , to appoint me ruler ouer the people of the Lord , ouer Israel : therefore will I play before the Lord .
And I will yet be more vile then thus , and will be base in mine owne sight : and of the maid seruants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .

And it came to passe , when the King sate in his house , and the Lord had giuen him rest round about from all his enemies ;
That the king said vnto Nathan the Prophet , See now , I dwell in an house of Cedar , but the Arke of God dwelleth within curtaines .
And Nathan sayde to the King , Go , doe all that is in thine heart : for the Lord is with thee .
¶ And it came to passe that night , that the word of the Lord came vnto Nathan , saying ;
Goe and tell my seruant Dauid , Thus sayth the Lord , Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in ?
Whereas I haue not dwelt in any house , since the time that I brought vp the children of Israel out of Egypt , euen to this day , but haue walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
In all the places wherein I haue walked with all the children of Israel , spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel , whome I commanded to feede my people Israel , saying , Why build ye not me an house of Cedar ?
Now therefore so shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid ; Thus sayth the Lord of hostes , I tooke thee from the sheepe - cote , from following the sheepe , to be ruler ouer my people , ouer Israel .
And I was with thee withersoeuer thou wentest , and haue cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and haue made thee a great name , like vnto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
( Moreouer I will appoint a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their owne , and mooue no more : neither shall the children of wickednesse afflict them any more , as beforetime ,
And as since the time that I commanded Iudges to bee ouer my people Israel , and haue caused thee to rest from all thine enemies : ) Also the Lord telleth thee , that he will make thee an house .
¶ And when thy dayes be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleepe with thy fathers , I will set vp thy seede after thee , which shall proceede out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdome .
Hee shall build an house for my Name , and I will stablish the throne of his kingdome for euer .
I will be his father , and he shall be my sonne : if hee commit iniquitie , I will chasten him with the rodde of men , and with the stripes of the children of men .
But my mercie shall not depart away from him , as I tooke it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
And thine house , and thy kingdome shall be stablished for euer before thee : thy throne shall be stablished for euer .
According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speake vnto Dauid .
¶ Then went king Dauid in , and sate before the Lord , and hee said , Who am I , O Lord God ? and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
And this was yet a small thing in thy sight , O Lord God : but thou hast spoken also of thy seruants house for a great while to come , and is this the maner of man , O Lord God ?
And what can Dauid say more vnto thee ? for thou , Lord God , knowest thy seruant .
For thy words sake , and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things , to make thy seruant know them .
Wherefore thou art great , O Lord God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we haue heard with our eares .
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people , euen like Israel , whom God went to redeeme for a people to himselfe , & to make him a name , and to doe for you great things , and terrible , for thy lande , before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt , from the nations , and their gods ?
For thou hast confirmed to thy selfe thy people Israel to be a people vnto thee for euer : and thou , Lord art become their God .
And now , O Lord God , the word that thou hast spoken , concerning thy seruant , and concerning his house , establish it for euer , and doe as thou hast said .
And let thy name bee magnified for euer , saying , The Lord of hosts is the God ouer Israel : and let the house of thy seruant Dauid bee established before thee .
For thou , O Lord of hostes , God of Israel , hast reuealed to thy seruant , saying , I will build thee an house : therfore hath thy seruant found in his heart to pray this prayer vnto thee .
And now , O Lord GOD , ( thou art that God , and thy words be true , and thou hast promised this goodnesse vnto thy seruant . )

And after this it came to passe , that Dauid smote the Philistines , and subdued them : and Dauid tooke Metheg - Ammah out of the hand of the Philistines .
And he smote Moab , and measured them with a line , casting them downe to the ground : euen with two lines measured he , to put to death , and with one full line to keepe aliue : and so the Moabites became Dauids seruants , and brought gifts .
¶ Dauid smote also Hadadezer the sonne of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recouer his border at the riuer Euphrates .
And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets , and seuen hundred horsemen , and twentie thousand footemen : and Dauid houghed all the charet horses , but reserued of them for an hundred charets .
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah , Dauid slew of the Syrians two and twentie thousand men .
Then Dauid put garisons in Syria of Damascus : And the Syrians became seruants to Dauid , and brought gifts : and the Lord preserued Dauid whithersoeuer he went .
And Dauid tooke the shields of gold that were on the seruants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Ierusalem .
And from Betah and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , King Dauid tooke exceeding much brasse .
¶ When Toi king of Hamath heard that Dauid had smitten all the hoste of Hadadezer ,
Then Toi sent Ioram his sonne vnto king Dauid to salute him , and to blesse him , because hee had fought against Hadadezer , and smitten him : ( for Hadadezer had warres with Toi ) and Ioram brought with him vessels of siluer , and vessels of gold , and vessels of brasse ;
Which also king Dauid did dedicate vnto the Lord , with the siluer and gold that he had dedicate of all nations which he subdued :
Of Syria , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , & of Amalek , and of the spoile of Hadadezer sonne of Rehob king of Zobah .
And Dauid gate him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt , being eighteene thousand men .
¶ And he put garrisons in Edom ; thorowout all Edom put he garrisons , and all they of Edom became Dauids seruants : and the Lord preserued Dauid whithersoeuer he went .
And Dauid reigned ouer all Israel , and Dauid executed iudgement and iustice vnto all his people .
And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the host , and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud was Recorder .
And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the sonne of Abiathar , were the Priests , and Seraiah was the scribe .
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid said , Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul , that I may shew him kindnesse for Ionathans sake ?
And there was of the house of Saul , a seruant whose name was Ziba : and when they had called him vnto Dauid , the king said vnto him , Art thou Ziba ? And he said , Thy seruant is he .
And the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may shew the kindnesse of God vnto him ? and Ziba said vnto the king , Ionathan hath yet a sonne , which is lame on his feete .
And the king saide vnto him , Where is hee ? and Ziba said vnto the king , Behold , he is in the house of Machir the sonne of Ammiel , in Lodebar .
¶ Then king Dauid sent , and fet him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , from Lodebar .
Now when Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul , was come vnto Dauid , hee fell on his face , and did reuerence : and Dauid said , Mephibosheth ! And he answered , Behold thy seruant .
¶ And Dauid saide vnto him , Feare not ; for I will surely shew thee kindnesse , for Ionathan thy fathers sake , and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father , and thou shalt eate bread at my table continually .
And hee bowed himselfe , and saide , What is thy seruant , that thou shouldest looke vpon such a dead dogge as I am ?
¶ Then the king called to Ziba Sauls seruant , and said vnto him , I haue giuen vnto thy masters sonne all that pertained to Saul , and to all his house . Thou therefore and thy sonnes , and thy seruants , shall till the land for him , and thou shalt bring in the fruits , that thy masters sonne may haue food to eate : but Mephibosheth thy masters sonne shall eat bread alway at my table . Now Ziba had fifteene sonnes , and twenty seruants .
Then saide Ziba vnto the king , According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his seruant , so shall thy seruant doe : as for Mephibosheth , said the King , he shall eate at my table , as one of the kings sonnes . And Mephibosheth had a yong sonne whose name was Micha : and all that dwelt in the house of Ziba , were seruants vnto Mephibosheth .

And it came to passe , after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his sonne reigned in his stead .
Then said Dauid , I will shewe kindnes vnto Hanun the sonne of Nahash , as his father shewed kindnes vnto me . And Dauid sent to comfort him by the hand of his seruants , for his father : and Dauids seruants came into the land of the children of Ammon .
And the princes of the children of Ammon saide vnto Hanun their lord , Thinkest thou that Dauid doeth honour thy father , that he hath sent comforters vnto thee ? Hath not Dauid rather sent his seruants vnto thee , to search the citie , and to spie it out , and to ouerthrow it ?
Wherefore Hanun tooke Dauids seruants , and shaued off the one halfe of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , euen to their buttocks , and sent them away .
When they told it vnto Dauid , he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly ashamed : and the King saide , Tarie at Iericho vntill your beards be growen , and then returne .
¶ And when the children of Ammon saw that they stanke before Dauid , the children of Ammon sent , and hired the Syrians of Beth - Rehob , and the Syrians of Zoba , twentie thousand footmen , and of king Maacah , a thousand men , and of Ishtob twelue thousand men .
And when Dauid heard of it , he sent Ioab , and all the hoste of the mightie men .
And the children of Ammon came out , and put the battell in aray at the entring in of the gate : and the Syrians of Zoba and of Rehob , and Ishtob , and Maacah , were by themselues in the field .
When Ioab saw that the front of the battell was against him , before and behind , he chose of all the choise men of Israel , and put them in aray against the Syrians .
And the rest of the people he deliuered into the hand of Abishai his brother , that he might put them in aray against the children of Ammon .
And he said , If the Syrians bee too strong for me , then thou shalt helpe me : but if the children of Ammon bee too strong for thee , then I will come and helpe thee .
Be of good courage , and let vs play the men , for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the Lord doe that which seemeth him good .
And Ioab drew nigh , and the people that were with him , vnto the battell against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fledde , then fled they also before Abishai , and entred into the citie : so Ioab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Ierusalem .
¶ And when the Syrians sawe that they were smitten before Israel , they gathered themselues together .
And Hadarezer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the riuer , and they came to Helam , and Shobach the captaine of the hoste of Hadarezer went before them .
And when it was told Dauid , he gathered all Israel together , and passed ouer Iordane , and came to Helam : and the Syrians set themselues in aray against Dauid , and fought with him .
And the Syrians fled before Israel , and Dauid slew the men of seuen hundred charets of the Syrians , and fourtie thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captaine of their hoste , who died there .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , that after the yeere was expired , at the time when kings goe foorth to battell , that Dauid sent Ioab and his seruants with him , and all Israel ; and they destroyed the children of Ammon , and besieged Rabbah : but Dauid taried still at Ierusalem .
¶ And it came to passe in an euening tide , that Dauid arose from off his bed , and walked vpon the roofe of the kings house : and from the roofe he saw a woman washing her selfe ; and the woman was very beautifull to looke vpon .
And Dauid sent and enquired after the woman : and one said , Is not this Bath - sheba the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ?
And Dauid sent messengers , and tooke her , and shee came in vnto him , and he lay with her , ( for she was purified from her vncleannesse ) and shee returned vnto her house .
And the woman conceiued , and sent and tolde Dauid , and said , I am with childe .
¶ And Dauid sent to Ioab , saying , Send me Uriah the Hittite . And Ioab sent Uriah to Dauid .
And when Uriah was come vnto him , Dauid demanded of him how Ioab did , and how the people did , and how the warre prospered .
And Dauid said to Uriah , Goe downe to thy house , and wash thy feete . And Uriah departed out of the Kings house , and there followed him a messe of meat from the king .
But Uriah slept at the doore of the kings house , with all the seruants of his lord , and went not downe to his house .
And when they had tolde Dauid , saying , Uriah went not downe vnto his house , Dauid said vnto Uriah , Camest thou not from thy iourney ? why then diddest thou not goe downe vnto thine house ?
And Uriah said vnto Dauid , The Arke , and Israel , and Iudah abide in tents , and my lord Ioab , and the seruants of my lord are encamped in the open fields ; shall I then goe into mine house , to eate and to drinke , and to lie with my wife ? As thou liuest , and as thy soule liueth , I will not doe this thing .
And Dauid said to Uriah , Tary here to day also , and to morow I will let thee depart . So Uriah abode in Ierusalem that day , and the morrow .
And when Dauid had called him , hee did eate and drinke before him , and he made him drunke : and at euen hee went out to lie on his bed with the seruants of his lord , but went not downe to his house .
¶ And it came to passe in the morning , that Dauid wrote a letter to Ioab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
And he wrote in the letter , saying , Set yee Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battel , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die .
And it came to passe when Ioab obserued the citie , that he assigned Uriah vnto a place where hee knewe that valiant men were .
And the men of the city went out , and fought with Ioab : and there fell some of the people of the seruants of Dauid , and Uriah the Hittite died also .
¶ Then Ioab sent , and tolde Dauid all the things concerning the warre :
And charged the messenger , saying , When thou hast made an ende of telling the matters of the warre vnto the King ;
And if so be that the kings wrath arise , and hee say vnto thee , Wherefore approched ye so nigh vnto the city when yee did fight ? Knew yee not that they would shoot from the wall ?
Who smote Abimelech the sonne of Ierubesheth ? Did not a woman cast a piece of a milstone vpon him from the wall , that he died in Thebez ? why went ye nigh the wall ? Then say thou , Thy seruant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
¶ So the messenger went , and came and shewed Dauid all that Ioab had sent him for .
And the messenger said vnto Dauid , Surely the men preuailed against vs , and came out vnto vs into the field , and we were vpon them euen vnto the entring of the gate .
And the shooters shot from off the wall vpon thy seruants , and some of the Kings seruants be dead , and thy seruant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
Then Dauid said vnto the messenger , Thus shalt thou say vnto Ioab , Let not this thing displease thee : for the sword deuoureth one as well as another : Make thy battell more strong against the citie , and ouerthrow it ; and encourage thou him .
¶ And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord sent Nathan vnto Dauid : and he came vnto him , and said vnto him , There were two men in one citie ; the one rich , and the other poore .
The rich man had exceeding many flockes and herds .
But the poore man had nothing saue one litle ewe lambe , which he had bought and nourished vp : and it grew vp together with him , and with his children , it did eate of his owne meate , and dranke of his owne cup , and lay in his bosome , and was vnto him as a daughter .
And there came a traueller vnto the rich man , and he spared to take of his owne flocke , and of his owne herd , to dresse for the wayfaring man that was come vnto him , but tooke the poore mans lambe , and dressed it for the man that was come to him .
And Dauids anger was greatly kindled against the man , and he said to Nathan , As the Lord liueth , the man that hath done this thing , shall surely die .
And he shall restore the Lambe fourefold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pittie .
¶ And Nathan said to Dauid , Thou art the man : thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I anointed thee king ouer Israel , and I deliuered thee out of the hand of Saul ,
And I gaue thee thy Masters house , and thy Masters wiues into thy bosome , and gaue thee the house of Israel and of Iudah , and if that had bene too litle , I would moreouer haue giuen vnto thee such and such things .
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandement of the Lord , to doe euill in his sight ? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slaine him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
Now therefore the sword shall neuer depart from thine house , because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite , to be thy wife .
Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will raise vp euill against thee out of thine owne house , and I will take thy wiues before thine eyes , and giue them vnto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wiues in the sight of this Sunne .
For thou diddest it secretly : but I will do this thing before all Israel , and before the Sunne .
And Dauid saide vnto Nathan , I haue sinned against the Lord . And Nathan saide vnto Dauid , The Lord also hath put away thy sinne , thou shalt not die .
Howbeit , because by this deede thou hast giuen great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme , the childe also that is borne vnto thee , shall surely die .
¶ And Nathan departed vnto his house : and the Lord strake the childe that Uriahs wife bare vnto Dauid , and it was very sicke .
Dauid therfore besought God for the childe , and Dauid fasted , and went in , and lay all night vpon the earth .
And the Elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him vp from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eate bread with them .
And it came to passe on the seuenth day , that the childe died : and the seruants of Dauid feared to tell him that the child was dead : for they saide , Behold , while the childe was yet aliue , we spake vnto him , and he would not hearken vnto our voice : how will he then vexe himselfe , if we tell him that the childe is dead ?
But when Dauid saw that his seruants whispered , Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead : therefore Dauid said vnto his seruants , Is the child dead ? and they said , He is dead .
Then Dauid arose from the earth and washed , and anointed himselfe , and changed his apparell , and came into the house of the Lord , and worshipped : then hee came to his owne house , and when he required , they set bread before him , and he did eate .
Then said his seruants vnto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weepe for the childe , while it was aliue , but when the childe was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
And he said , While the child was yet aliue , I fasted and wept : for I said , Who can tell , whether God will be gracious to me , that the child may liue ?
But now hee is dead , Wherefore should I fast ? Can I bring him backe againe ? I shall goe to him , but he shall not returne to me .
¶ And Dauid comforted Bathsheba his wife , and went in vnto her , and lay with her : and she bare a sonne , and he called his name Solomon , and the Lord loued him .
And hee sent by the hand of Nathan the Prophet , and hee called his name Iedidiah , because of the Lord .
¶ And Ioab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and tooke the royall citie .
And Ioab sent messengers to Dauid , and said , I haue fought against Rabbah , and haue taken the citie of waters .
Now therefore , gather the rest of the people together , and encampe against the citie , and take it : lest I take the citie , and it be called after my name .
And Dauid gathered all the people together , and went to Rabbah , and fought against it , and tooke it .
And he tooke their kings crowne from off his head ( the weight whereof was a talent of gold , with the precious stones ) and it was set on Dauids head , and he brought forth the spoile of the citie in great abundance .

And it came to passe after this , that Absalom the sonne of Dauid had a faire sister , whose name was Tamar : and Amnon the sonne of Dauid loued her .
And Amnon was so vexed , that he fell sicke for his sister Tamar : for she was a virgine , and Amnon thought it hard for him to doe any thing to her .
But Amnon had a friend , whose name was Ionadab , the sonne of Shimeah , Dauids brother : and Ionadab was a very subtill man .
And he saide vnto him , Why art thou , being the Kings sonne , leane from day to day ? Wilt thou not tel me ? and Amnon said vnto him , I loue Tamar my brother Absaloms sister .
And Ionadab said vnto him , Lay thee downe on thy bed , and make thy selfe sicke : and when thy father commeth to see thee , say vnto him , I pray thee , let my sister Tamar come , and giue me meat , and dresse the meat in my sight , that I may see it , and eate it at her hand .
¶ So Amnon lay downe , and made himselfe sicke : and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said vnto the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , & make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
Then Dauid sent home to Tamar , saying , Goe now to thy brother Amnons house , and dresse him meat .
So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house ( and hee was laide downe ) and she tooke flowre , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and did bake the cakes . And she tooke a pan , and powred them out before him , but hee refused to eate : and Amnon said , Haue out all men from mee : And they went out euery man from him .
And Amnon saide vnto Tamar , Bring the meate into the chamber , that I may eate of thine hand . And Tamar tooke the cakes which shee had made , and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother .
And when shee had brought them vnto him to eate , hee tooke hold of her , and said vnto her , Come lye with mee , my sister .
And she answered him , Nay , my brother , doe not force me : for no such thing ought to bee done in Israel ; doe not thou this folly .
And I , whither shall I cause my shame to goe ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fooles in Israel : now therefore , I pray thee , speake vnto the king , for he will not withhold me from thee .
Howbeit hee would not hearken vnto her voice , but being stronger then shee , forced her , and lay with her .
¶ Then Amnon hated her exceedingly , so that the hatred wherwith he hated her , was greater then the loue wherewith hee had loued her : And Amnon said vnto her , Arise , be gone .
And she said vnto him , There is no cause : this euill in sending me away , is greater then the other that thou diddest vnto me : But he would not hearken vnto her .
Then hee called his seruant that ministred vnto him , and said , Put now this woman out from mee , and bolt the doore after her .
And shee had a garment of diuers colours vpon her : for with such robes were the Kings daughters , that were virgins , apparelled . Then his seruant brought her out , and bolted the doore after her .
¶ And Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of diuers colours that was on her , and layde her hand on her head , and went on , crying .
And Absalom her brother sayde vnto her , Hath Amnon thy brother beene with thee ? But holde nowe thy peace , my sister : he is thy brother , regard not this thing . So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms house .
¶ But when King Dauid heard of all these things , he was very wroth .
And Absalom spake vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad : for Absalom hated Amnon , because he had forced his sister Tamar .
¶ And it came to passe after two full yeeres , that Absalom had sheepeshearers in Baal - Hazor , which is beside Ephraim : and Absalom inuited all the kings sonnes .
And Absalom came to the King , and said , Behold now , thy seruant hath sheepe - shearers , Let the King , I beseech thee , and his seruants , goe with thy seruant .
And the King sayde to Absalom , Nay , my sonne , let vs not all now goe , lest we be chargeable vnto thee . And he pressed him : howbeit he would not goe , but blessed him .
Then said Absalom , If not , I pray thee , let my brother Amnon goe with vs . And the King said vnto him , Why should he goe with thee ?
But Absalom pressed him , that he let Amnon and all the kings sonnes goe with him .
¶ Now Absalom had commanded his seruants , saying , Marke yee now when Amnons heart is merrie with wine , and when I say vnto you , Smite Amnon , then kill him , feare not : haue not I commanded you ? be couragious , and be valiant .
And the seruants of Absalom did vnto Amnon as Absalom had commanded : then all the Kings sonnes arose , and euery man gate him vp vpon his mule , and fled .
¶ And it came to passe while they were in the way , that tidings came to Dauid , saying , Absalom hath slaine all the Kings sonnes , and there is not one of them left .
Then the king arose , and tare his garments , and lay on the earth : and all his seruants stoode by with their clothes rent .
And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother , answered and said , Let not my lord suppose that they haue slaine all the yong men the Kings sonnes ; for Amnon onely is dead : for by the appointment of Absalom this hath beene determined , from the day that he forced his sister Tamar .
Now therefore let not my lord the King take the thing to his heart , to thinke that all the Kings sonnes are dead : for Amnon onely is dead .
But Absalom fled : and the yong man that kept the watch , lift vp his eyes , and looked , and behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
And Ionadab said vnto the king , Behold , the kings sonnes come : as thy seruant said , so it is .
And it came to passe assoone as hee had made an ende of speaking , that behold , the kings sonnes came , and lift vp their voice , and wept ; and the King also and all his seruants wept very sore .
¶ But Absalom fled , and went to Talmai the sonne of Ammihud king of Geshur : and Dauid mourned for his sonne euery day .
So Absalom fled , and went to Geshur , and was there three yeeres .
<NON-VERSE>
Now Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah , perceiued that the kings heart was toward Absalom .
And Ioab sent to Tekoah , and fetcht thence a wise woman , and said vnto her , I pray thee , faine thy selfe to be a mourner , and put on now mourning apparel , and anoint not thy selfe with oile , but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead :
And come to the king , and speake on this maner vnto him : so Ioab put the words in her mouth .
¶ And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , shee fell on her face to the ground , and did obeysance , and said , Helpe , O king .
And the king said vnto her , What aileth thee ? And she answered , I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead .
And thy handmayd had two sonnes , and they two stroue together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
And behold , the whole family is risen against thine handmayd , and they said , Deliuer him that smote his brother , that we may kill him , for the life of his brother whom he slew , and we will destroy the heire also : and so they shall quench my cole which is left , and shall not leaue to my husband neither name nor remainder vpon the earth .
And the king saide vnto the woman , Goe to thine house , and I will giue charge concerning thee .
And the woman of Tekoah said vnto the king , My lord , O king , the iniquitie bee on mee , and on my fathers house : and the king and his throne bee guiltlesse .
And the king said , Whosoeuer saith ought vnto thee , bring him to mee , and he shall not touch thee any more .
Then said she , I pray thee , let the king remember the Lord thy God , that thou wouldest not suffer the reuengers of blood to destroy any more , lest they destroy my sonne . And he said , As the Lord liueth , there shall not one haire of thy sonne fall to the earth .
Then the woman said , Let thine handmayd , I pray thee , speake one word vnto my lord the king . And hee said , Say on .
And the woman said , Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God ? For the king doeth speake this thing as one which is faulty , in that the king doeth not fetch home againe his banished .
For we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which cannot bee gathered vp againe : neither doeth God respect any person , yet doeth he deuise meanes , that his banished bee not expelled from him .
Now therefore that I am come to speake of this thing vnto my lord the king , it is because the people haue made me afraid : and thy handmayd said , I will now speake vnto the king ; it may bee that the king will performe the request of his handmayd .
For the king wil heare , to deliuer his handmayd out of the hand of the man that would destroy mee , and my sonne together out of the inheritance of God :
Then thine handmaid said , The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an Angel of God , so is my lord the king to discerne good and bad : therfore the Lord thy God will be with thee .
Then the king answered and said vnto the woman , Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall aske thee . And the woman said , Let my lord the king now speake .
And the king said , Is not the hand of Ioab with thee in all this ? And the woman answered and said , As thy soule liueth , my lord the king , none can turne to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken : for thy seruant Ioab , hee bade me , and he put all these wordes in the mouth of thine handmaid :
To fetch about this forme of speech hath thy seruant Ioab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisedome of an Angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
¶ And the king said vnto Ioab , Behold now , I haue done this thing : goe therefore , bring the yong man Absalom againe .
And Ioab fell to the ground on his face , & bowed himselfe , and thanked the king : and Ioab said , To day thy seruant knoweth that I haue found grace in thy sight , my lord O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his seruant .
So Ioab arose , and went to Geshur , & brought Absalom to Ierusalem .
And the king said , Let him turne to his owne house , & let him not see my face . So Absalom returned to his owne house , and sawe not the kings face .
¶ But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom , for his beautie : from the sole of his foot euen to the crowne of his head , there was no blemish in him .
And when he polled his head , ( for it was at euery yeres end that he polled it : because the haire was heauy on him , therefore he polled it ) hee weighed the haire of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight .
And vnto Absalom there were borne three sonnes , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : shee was a woman of a faire countenance .
¶ So Absalom dwelt two full yeeres in Ierusalem , and saw not the kings face .
Therefore Absalom sent for Ioab , to haue sent him to the king , but hee would not come to him : and when hee sent againe the second time , hee would not come .
Therefore hee said vnto his seruants , See , Ioabs field is neere mine , and he hath barley there : goe , and set it on fire : and Absaloms seruants set the field on fire .
Then Ioab arose , and came to Absalom vnto his house , and said vnto him , Wherefore haue thy seruants set my field on fire ?
And Absalom answered Ioab , Behold , I sent vnto thee , saying , come hither , that I may send thee to the king to say , Wherefore am I come from Geshur ? It had bene good for mee to haue bene there still : now therefore let me see the kings face : and if there bee any iniquitie in me , let him kill me .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe after this , that Absalom prepared him charets and horses , and fiftie men to runne before him .
And Absalom rose vp earely , and stood beside the way of the gate : and it was so , that when any man that had a controuersie , came to the king for iudgment , then Absalom called vnto him , and said , Of what citie art thou ? And he said , Thy seruant is of one of the tribes of Israel .
And Absalom said vnto him , See , thy matters are good & right , but there is no man deputed of the king to heare thee .
Absalom said moreouer , Oh that I were made Iudge in the land , that euery man which hath any suit or cause , might come vnto me , and I would do him iustice .
And it was so , that when any man came nigh to him , to doe him obeisance , he put foorth his hand , and tooke him , and kissed him .
And on this maner did Absalom to all Israel , that came to the King for iudgement : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
¶ And it came to passe after fourtie yeeres , that Absalom said vnto the king , I pray thee , let mee goe and pay my vow which I haue vowed vnto the Lord in Hebron .
For thy seruant vowed a vowe while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , If the Lord shall bring mee againe in deed to Ierusalem , then I will serue the Lord .
And the king said vnto him , Goe in peace . So he arose , and went to Hebron .
¶ But Absalom sent spies thorowout all the tribes of Israel , saying , As soone as yee heare the sound of the trumpet , then yee shall say , Absalom reigneth in Hebron .
And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Ierusalem , that were called , and they went in their simplicitie , and they knew not any thing .
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , Dauids counseller , from his citie , euen from Giloh , while he offered sacrifices : and the conspiracie was strong , for the people encreased continually with Absalom .
¶ And there came a messenger to Dauid , saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom .
And Dauid said vnto all his seruants that were with him at Ierusalem , Arise , and let vs flee ; for wee shall not else escape from Absalom : make speede to depart , lest hee ouertake vs suddenly , and bring euill vpon vs , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
And the kings seruants said vnto the king , Behold , thy seruants are readie to doe whatsoeuer my lord the king shall appoint .
And the king went foorth , and all his houshold after him : and the King left tenne women , which were concubines , to keepe the house .
And the king went forth , and all the people after him , and taried in a place that was farre off .
And all his seruants passed on beside him : and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , sixe hundred men , which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
¶ Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite , Wherefore goest thou also with vs ? Returne to thy place , and abide with the King : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile .
Whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee goe vp and downe with vs ? Seeing I goe whither I may , returne thou , and take backe thy brethren : mercie and trueth be with thee .
And Ittai answered the King , and said , As the Lord liueth , and as my lord the king liueth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , euen there also will thy seruant be .
And Dauid said to Ittai , Goe , and passe ouer . And Ittai the Gittite passed ouer , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him .
And all the countrey wept with a loude voice , and all the people passed ouer : the King also himselfe passed ouer the brooke Kidron , and all the people passed ouer , toward the way of the wildernesse .
¶ And loe , Zadok also , and all the Leuites were with him , bearing the Arke of the Couenant of God , and they set downe the Arke of God ; and Abiathar went vp , vntill all the people had done passing out of the citie .
And the King said vnto Zadok , Cary backe the Arke of God into the citie : if I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the Lord , he wil bring me againe , and shew me both it , and his habitation .
But if he thus say , I haue no delight in thee : beholde , here am I , let him doe to me , as seemeth good vnto him .
The king said also vnto Zadok the Priest , Art not thou a Seer ? Returne into the citie in peace , and your two sonnes with you , Ahimaaz thy sonne , and Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar .
See , I will tarie in the plaine of the wildernesse , vntill there come word from you to certifie me .
Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem ; and they taried there .
¶ And Dauid went vp by the ascent of mount Oliuet , and wept as he went vp , and had his head couered , and he went barefoote , and all the people that was with him , couered euery man his head , and they went vp , weeping as they went vp .
¶ And one tolde Dauid , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . And Dauid sayde , O Lord , I pray thee turne the counsell of Ahithophel into foolishnesse .
¶ And it came to passe , that when Dauid was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him , with his coat rent , and earth vpon his head :
Unto whom Dauid said , If thou passest on with me , then thou shalt be a burden vnto me .
But if thou returne to the citie , and say vnto Absalom , I wil be thy seruant , O king : as I haue bene thy fathers seruant hitherto , so will I now also be thy seruant : then mayest thou for mee defeat the counsell of Ahithophel .
And hast thou not there with thee Zadok , and Abiathar the Priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soeuer thou shalt heare out of the kings house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the Priests .
Behold , they haue there with them their two sonnes , Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne , and Ionathan Abiathars sonne : and by them ye shall send vnto me euery thing that ye can heare .
<NON-VERSE>
And when Dauid was a little past the top of the hill , Beholde , Ziba the seruant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses sadled , and vpon them two hundred loaues of bread , and an hundred bunches of raisins , and an hundred of summer fruits , and a bottell of wine .
And the King saide vnto Ziba , What meanest thou by these ? And Ziba saide , The asses bee for the kings houshold to ride on , and the bread and summer fruit for the yong men to eate , and the wine , that such as be faint in the wildernesse , may drinke .
And the king said , And where is thy masters sonne ? and Ziba said vnto the king , Behold , he abideth at Ierusalem : for hee said , To day shall the house of Israel restore mee the kingdome of my father .
Then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained vnto Mephibosheth . And Ziba saide , I humbly beseech thee that I may finde grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
¶ And when king Dauid came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei the sonne of Gera : hee came foorth , and cursed still as he came .
And he cast stones at Dauid , and at all the seruants of king Dauid : and all the people , and all the mighty men were on his right hand , and on his left .
And thus said Shimei when hee cursed , Come out , come out thou bloody man , and thou man of Belial :
The Lord hath returned vpon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast raigned , and the Lord hath deliuered the kingdome into the hand of Absalom thy sonne : and behold , thou art taken to thy mischiefe , because thou art a bloody man .
¶ Then said Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah vnto the king , Why should this dead dogge curse my lord the king ? let mee goe ouer , I pray thee , and take off his head .
And the king said , What haue I to doe with you , ye sonnes of Zeruiah ? So let him curse , because the Lord hath said vnto him , Curse Dauid . Who shall then say , Wherefore hast thou done so ?
And Dauid said to Abishai , and to all his seruants , Beholde , my sonne which came foorth of my bowels , seeketh my life : how much more now may this Beniamite doe it ? let him alone , and let him curse : for the Lord hath bidden him .
It may bee that the Lord will looke on mine affliction , and that the Lord will requite good for his cursing this day .
And as Dauid and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hilles side ouer against him , and cursed as hee went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
And the king , and all the people that were with him , came weary , and refreshed themselues there .
¶ And Absalom and al the people the men of Israel , came to Ierusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
And it came to passe when Hushai the Archite , Dauids friend , was come vnto Absalom , that Hushai said vnto Absalom , God saue the king , God saue the king .
And Absalom said to Hushai , Is this thy kindnesse to thy friend ? Why wentest thou not with thy friend ?
And Hushai said vnto Absalom , Nay , but whom the Lord and this people , and all the men of Israel chuse , his will I bee , and with him will I abide .
And againe , whom should I serue ? should I not serue in the presence of his sonne ? as I haue serued in thy fathers presence , so will I be in thy presence .
¶ Then said Absalom to Ahithophel , Giue counsell among you what we shall doe .
And Ahithophel said vnto Absalom , Goe in vnto thy fathers concubines , which he hath left to keepe the house , and all Israel shall heare that thou art abhorred of thy father , then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong .
So they spread Absalom a tent vpon the top of the house , and Absalom went in vnto his fathers concubines , in the sight of all Israel .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer Ahithophel said vnto Absalom , Let mee nowe chuse out twelue thousand men , and I will arise and pursue after Dauid this night .
And I wil come vpon him while hee is wearie and weake handed , and wil make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee , and I will smite the king onely .
And I wil bring backe all the people vnto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
And the saying pleased Absalom well , and all the Elders of Israel .
Then said Absalom , Call now Hushai the Archite also , and let vs heare likewise what he saith .
And when Hushai was come to Absalom , Absalom spake vnto him , saying , Ahithophel hath spoken after this maner : shall we doe after his saying ? if not , speake thou .
And Hushai said vnto Absalom , The counsell that Ahithophel hath giuen , is not good at this time .
For , ( said Hushai , ) thou knowest thy father and his men , that they bee mightie men , and they be chafed in their minds , as a beare robbed of her whelps in the field : and thy father is a man of warre , and will not lodge with the people .
Behold , he is hid now in some pit , or in some other place : and it wil come to passe when some of them bee ouerthrowen at the first , that whosoeuer heareth it , wil say , There is a slaughter among the people that followe Absalom .
And he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a Lyon , shall vtterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mightie man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
Therefore I counsell , that all Israel be generally gathered vnto thee , from Dan euen to Beer - sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude , and that thou goe to battell in thine owne person .
So shall wee come vpon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light vpon him as the dew falleth on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him , there shall not be left so much as one .
Moreouer , if hee be gotten into a citie , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the riuer , vntill there be not one small stone found there .
And Absalom and all the men of Israel said , The counsell of Hushai the Archite , is better then the counsell of Ahithophel : For the Lord had appointed to defeate the good counsell of Ahithophel , to the intent that the Lord might bring euill vpon Absalom .
¶ Then said Hushai vnto Zadok and to Abiathar the Priestes , Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsell Absalom and the Elders of Israel , and thus and thus haue I counselled .
Now therefore send quickly , and tell Dauid , saying , Lodge not this night in the plaines of the wildernes , but speedily passe ouer , lest the King be swallowed vp , and all the people that are with him .
Now Ionathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En - rogel : ( for they might not be seene to come into the citie ) and a wench went and tolde them : and they went , and tolde king Dauid .
Neuerthelesse , a ladde saw them , and tolde Absalom : but they went both of them away quickely , and came to a mans house in Bahurim , which had a Well in his court , whither they went downe .
And the woman tooke and spread a couering ouer the welles mouth , and spread ground corne thereon ; and the thing was not knowen .
And when Absaloms seruants came to the woman to the house , they said , Where is Ahimaaz and Ionathan ? And the woman said vnto them , They be gone ouer the brooke of water . And when they had sought , and could not finde them , they returned to Ierusalem .
And it came to passe after they were departed , that they came vp out of the Well , and went and tolde king Dauid , and said vnto Dauid , Arise , and passe quickely ouer the water : for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you .
Then Dauid arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed ouer Iordane : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone ouer Iordane .
¶ And when Ahithophel sawe that his counsell was not followed , he sadled his asse , and arose , and gate him home to his house , to his citie , and put his houshold in order , and hanged himselfe , and died , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
Then Dauid came to Mahanaim : and Absalom passed ouer Iordane , he and all the men of Israel with him .
¶ And Absalom made Amasa captaine of the hoste in stead of Ioab : which Amasa was a mans sonne whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Ioabs mother .
So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead .
¶ And it came to passe when Dauid was come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the sonne of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the sonne of Ammiel of Lodebar , and Barzillai the Gileadite , of Rogelim ,
Brought beds , and basins , and earthen vessels , and wheat , and barley , and floure , and parched corne , & beanes , and lentiles , and parched pulse ,
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid numbred the people that were with him , and set captaines of thousands , and captaines of hundreds ouer them .
And Dauid sent forth a third part of the people vnder the hand of Ioab , and a third part vnder the hand of Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah Ioabs brother , and a third part vnder the hand of Ittai the Gittite : and the king said vnto the people , I will surely goe foorth with you my selfe also .
But the people answered , Thou shalt not goe foorth : for if we flee away , they will not care for vs , neither if halfe of vs die will they care for vs : but now thou art worth ten thousand of vs : therfore now it is better that thou succour vs out of the citie .
And the King sayde vnto them , What seemeth you best , I will doe . And the King stood by the gate side , and all the people came out by hundreds , and by thousands .
And the king commanded Ioab , and Abishai , and Ittai , saying , Deale gently for my sake with the yong man , euen with Absalom . And all the people heard when the king gaue all the captaines charge concerning Absalom .
¶ So the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battell was in the wood of Ephraim ,
Where the people of Israel were slaine before the seruants of Dauid , and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men .
For the battell was there scattered ouer the face of all the countrey : and the wood deuoured more people that day , then the sword deuoured .
¶ And Absalom met the seruants of Dauid ; and Absalom rode vpon a mule , and the mule went vnder the thicke boughs of a great Oke , and his head caught hold of the Oke , and hee was taken vp betweene the heauen and the earth , and the mule that was vnder him , went away .
And a certaine man saw it , and told Ioab , and said , Behold , I saw Absalom hanged in an Oke .
And Ioab said vnto the man that told him , And behold , thou sawest him , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground , and I would haue giuen thee tenne shekels of siluer , and a girdle ?
And the man saide vnto Ioab , Though I should receiue a thousand shekels of siluer in mine hand , yet would I not put foorth mine hand against the Kings sonne : for in our hearing the King charged thee , and Abishai , and Ittai , saying , Beware that none touch the yong man Absalom .
Otherwyse , I should haue wrought falshood against mine owne life : for there is no matter hid from the King , and thou thy selfe wouldest haue set thy selfe against me .
Then said Ioab , I may not tary thus with thee . And hee tooke three darts in his hand , and thrust them thorow the heart of Absalom , while hee was yet aliue in the midst of the Oke .
And ten yong men that bare Ioabs armour , compassed about and smote Absalom , and slew him .
And Ioab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after Israel : for Ioab helde backe the people .
And they tooke Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and layd a very great heape of stones vpon him : and all Israel fled euery one to his tent .
¶ Now Absalom in his life time had taken and reared vp for himselfe a pillar , which is in the Kings dale : for hee said , I haue no sonne to keepe my name in remembrance : And hee called the pillar after his owne name , and it is called vnto this day , Absaloms place .
¶ Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok , Let mee now runne , and beare the King tidings , how that the Lord hath auenged him of his enemies .
And Ioab said vnto him , Thou shalt not beare tidings this day , but thou shalt beare tidings another day : but this day thou shalt beare no tidings , because the Kings sonne is dead .
Then said Ioab to Cushi , Goe tell the King what thou hast seene . And Cushi bowed himselfe vnto Ioab , and ranne .
Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok yet againe to Ioab , But howsoeuer , let mee , I pray thee , also runne after Cushi . And Ioab said , Wherefore wilt thou runne , my sonne , seeing that thou hast no tidings ready ?
But howsoeuer , ( said he ) let mee runne : And hee said vnto him , Runne . Then Ahimaaz ranne by the way of the plaine , and ouerranne Cushi .
And Dauid sate betweene the two gates : and the watchman went vp to the roofe ouer the gate vnto the wall , and lift vp his eyes , and looked , and behold , a man running alone .
And the watchman cried , and told the King . And the king said , If he bee alone , there is tidings in his mouth . And he came apace , and drew neere .
And the watchman saw another man running , and the watchman called vnto the porter , and said , Behold , another man running alone . And the King said , He also bringeth tidings .
And the watchman said , Mee thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok . And the King said , Hee is a good man , and commeth with good tidings .
And Ahimaaz called , and said vnto the King , All is well . And hee fell downe to the earth vpon his face before the King , and saide , Blessed bee the Lord thy God which hath deliuered vp the men that lift vp their hande against my lord the King .
And the king said , Is the yong man Absalom safe ? And Ahimaaz answered , When Ioab sent the kings seruant , and me thy seruant , I saw a great tumult , but I knew not what it was .
And the king said vnto him , Turne aside and stand here . And hee turned aside , and stood still .
And behold , Cushi came , and Cushi said , Tidings my lord the king : for the Lord hath auenged thee this day of all them that rose vp against thee .
And the king said vnto Cushi , Is the yong man Absalom safe ? And Cushi answered , The enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to doe thee hurt , be as that yong man is .
<NON-VERSE>
And it was told Ioab , Beholde , the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom .
And the victorie that day was turned into mourning vnto all the people : for the people heard say that day , how the king was grieued for his sonne .
And the people gate them by stealth that day into the citie , as people beeing ashamed steale away when they flee in battell .
But the king couered his face , and the king cried with a loud voyce , O my sonne Absalom , O Absalom my sonne , my sonne .
And Ioab came into the house to the king , and said , Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy seruants , which this day haue saued thy life , and the liues of thy sonnes , & of thy daughters , and the liues of thy wiues , and the liues of thy concubines ,
In that thou louest thine enemies , and hatest thy friends ; for thou hast declared this day , that thou regardest neither princes , nor seruants : for this day I perceiue , that if Absalom had liued , and all we had died this day , then it had pleased thee well .
Now therefore arise , goe foorth , and speake comfortably vnto thy seruants : for I sweare by the Lord , if thou goe not forth , there wil not tarie one with thee this night , and that will be worse vnto thee then all the euill that befell thee from thy youth vntill now .
Then the King rose , and sate in the gate : and they told vnto all the people , saying , Behold , the king doth sit in the gate : and all the people came before the king : for Israel had fled euery man to his tent .
¶ And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , The king saued vs out of the hand of our enemies , and he deliuered vs out of the hand of the Philistines , and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom .
And Absalom whom wee anointed ouer vs , is dead in battell : nowe therefore why speake ye not a word of bringing the king backe ?
¶ And King Dauid sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , saying , Speake vnto the Elders of Iudah , saying , Why are ye the last to bring the king backe to his house ? ( seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king , euen to his house . )
Yee are my brethren , Yee are my bones and my flesh : wherfore then are ye the last to bring backe the king ?
And say ye to Amasa : Art thou not of my bone , and of my flesh ? God do so to me , and more also , if thou be not captaine of the hoste before me continually in the roome of Ioab .
And he bowed the heart of all the men of Iudah , euen as the heart of one man , so that they sent this word vnto the King , Returne thou and all thy seruants .
So the King returned , and came to Iordan : and Iudah came to Gilgal , to goe to meet the King , to conduct the king ouer Iordane .
¶ And Shimei the sonne of Gera , a Beniamite , which wass of Bahurim , hasted , & came downe with the men of Iudah , to meet King Dauid .
And there were a thousand men of Beniamin with him , and Ziba the seruant of the house of Saul , and his fifteene sonnes and his twenty seruants with him , and they went ouer Iordane before the King .
And there went ouer a ferry - boat to cary ouer the kings houshold , and to doe what he thought good : and Shimei the sonne of Gera fell downe before the king as he was come ouer Iordane ;
And said vnto the king , Let not my lord impute iniquitie vnto me , neither do thou remember that which thy seruant did peruersly the day that my lord the king went out of Ierusalem , that the king should take it to his heart .
For thy seruant doeth know that I haue sinned : therefore behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Ioseph , to goe downe to meete my lord the king .
But Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah answered , and sayd , Shall not Shimei be put to death for this , because hee cursed the Lords Anointed ?
And Dauid said , What haue I to doe with you , yee sonnes of Zeruiah , that yee should this day be aduersaries vnto me ? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel ? for doe not I know , that I am this day King ouer Israel ?
Therfore the king said vnto Shimei , Thou shalt not die : and the King sware vnto him .
¶ And Mephibosheth the sonne of Saul came downe to meet the king , and had neither dressed his feete , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the King departed , vntill the day hee came againe in peace .
And it came to passe when he was come to Ierusalem to meete the King , that the King sayd vnto him , Wherefore wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ?
And hee answered , My lord O king , my seruant deceiued mee ; for thy seruant sayd , I will saddle me an asse that I may ride thereon , and goe to the king , because thy seruant is lame :
And hee hath slandered thy seruant vnto my lord the king , but my lord the King is as an Angel of God : doe therefore what is good in thine eyes .
For all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet diddest thou set thy seruant among them that did eate at thine owne table : what right therefore haue I yet to crie any more vnto the king ?
And the king said vnto him , Why speakest thou any more of thy matters ? I haue said , Thou and Ziba diuide the land .
And Mephibosheth said vnto the king , Yea , let him take all , forasmuch as my lorde the king is come againe in peace vnto his owne house .
¶ And Barzillai the Gileadite came downe from Rogelim , and went ouer Iordane with the king , to conduct him ouer Iordane .
Now Barzillai was a very aged man , euen fourescore yeeres olde , and he had prouided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim : for he was a very great man .
And the king said vnto Barzillai , Come thou ouer with me , and I will feede thee with me in Ierusalem .
And Barzillai sayde vnto the king , How long haue I to liue , that I should goe vp with the King vnto Ierusalem ?
I am this day fourescore yeeres olde : and can I discerne betweene good and euill ? Can thy seruant taste what I eate , or what I drinke ? can I heare any more the voice of singing men and singing women ? wherfore then should thy seruant bee yet a burden vnto my lord the king ?
Thy seruant will goe a little way ouer Iordane with the king : and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward ?
Let thy seruant , I pray thee , turne backe againe , that I may die in mine owne citie , and be buried by the graue of my father , and of my mother : but behold thy seruant Chimham , let him go ouer with my lord the king , and doe to him what shall seeme good vnto thee .
And the king answered , Chimham shal goe ouer with me , and I will doe to him that which shall seeme good vnto thee : and whatsoeuer thou shalt require of me , that will I doe for thee .
And all the people went ouer Iordane : and when the king was come ouer , the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him , and he returned vnto his owne place .
Then the King went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him : and all the people of Iudah conducted the king , and also halfe the people of Israel .
¶ And behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said vnto the king , Why haue our brethren the men of Iudah stollen thee away , and haue brought the King and his houshold , and all Dauids men with him , ouer Iordane ?
And all the men of Iudah answered the men of Israel , Because the king is neere of kinne to vs : wherefore then be ye angrie for this matter ? Haue we eaten at all of the kings cost ? or hath he giuen vs any gift ?
<NON-VERSE>
And there happened to bee there a man of Belial , whose name was Sheba the sonne of Bichri , a Beniamite , & hee blew a trumpet , and said , Wee haue no part in Dauid , neither haue we inheritance in the sonne of Iesse : euery man to his tents , O Israel .
So euery man of Israel went vp from after Dauid , and followed Sheba the sonne of Bichri : but the men of Iudah claue vnto their king , from Iordane euen to Ierusalem .
¶ And Dauid came to his house at Ierusalem , and the king tooke the ten women his concubines , whom he had left to keep the house , and put them in ward , and fed them , but went not in vnto them : so they were shut vp vnto the day of their death , liuing in widowhood .
¶ Then said the king to Amasa , Assemble me the men of Iudah within three dayes , and be thou here present .
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Iudah ; but hee taried longer then the set time which he had appointed him .
And Dauid said to Abishai , Now shall Sheba the sonne of Bichri doe vs more harme then did Absalom : take thou thy lords seruants , and pursue after him , lest he get him fenced cities , and escape vs .
And there went out after him Ioabs men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of Ierusalem , to pursue after Sheba the sonne of Bichri .
When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon , Amasa went before them : and Ioabs garment that he had put on , was girded vnto him , and vpon it a girdle with a sword fastned vpon his loynes in the sheath thereof , and as hee went forth , it fell out .
And Ioab saide to Amasa , Art thou in health , my brother ? And Ioab tooke Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kisse him .
But Amasa tooke no heed to the sword that was in Ioabs hand : so hee smote him therewith in the fifth rib , and shed out his bowels to the ground , and strake him not againe , and he died : so Ioab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the sonne of Bichri .
And one of Ioabs men stood by him , and said , He that fauoureth Ioab , and hee that is for Dauid , let him goe after Ioab .
And Amasa wallowed in blood in the mids of the high way : and when the man saw that all the people stood still , he remoued Amasa out of the high way into the field , and cast a cloth vpon him , when hee saw that euery one that came by him , stood still .
When he was remoued out of the high way , all the people went on after Ioab , to pursue after Sheba the sonne of Bichri .
¶ And hee went thorow all the tribes of Israel vnto Abel , and to Bethmaachah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah , and they cast vp a banke against the citie , and it stood in the trench : and all the people that were with Ioab , battered the wall , to throw it downe .
¶ Then cried a wise woman out of the citie , Heare , heare ; say , I pray you , vnto Ioab , Come neere hither , that I may speake with thee .
And when he was come neere vnto her , the woman said , Art thou Ioab ? And he answered , I am he : Then shee said vnto him , Heare the words of thine handmaid . And he answered , I doe heare .
Then she spake , saying , They were wont to speake in old time , saying , They shall surely aske counsell at Abel : and so they ended the matter .
I am one of them that are peaceable and faithfull in Israel : thou seekest to destroy a citie , and a mother in Israel : Why wilt thou swallow vp the inheritance of the Lord ?
And Ioab answered and saide , Farre be it , farre be it from me , that I should swallow vp or destroy .
The matter is not so : but a man of mount Ephraim ( Sheba the sonne of Bichri by name ) hath lift vp his hand against the king , euen against Dauid : deliuer him onely , and I will depart from the city . And the woman said vnto Ioab , Behold , his head shall be throwen to thee ouer the wall .
Then the woman went vnto all the people in her wisedome , and they cut off the head of Sheba the sonne of Bichri , and cast it out to Ioab : and hee blew a trumpet , and they retired from the citie , euery man to his tent : & Ioab returned to Ierusalem vnto the king .
¶ Now Ioab was ouer all the hoste of Israel , and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the Cherethites , and ouer the Pelethites .
And Adoram was ouer the tribute , and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud was Recorder .
And Sheua was scribe , and Zadok , and Abiathar were the Priests .
<NON-VERSE>
Then there was a famine in the dayes of Dauid three yeeres , yeere after yeere , and Dauid enquired of the Lord . And the Lord answered , It is for Saul , and for his bloodie house , because he slew the Gibeonites .
And the king called the Gibeonites , and said vnto them , ( now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel , but of the remnant of the Amorites , and the children of Israel had sworne vnto them : and Saul sought to slay them , in his zeale to the children of Israel and Iudah )
Wherefore Dauid said vnto the Gibeonites , What shall I doe for you ? and wherwith shall I make the atonement , that ye may blesse the inheritance of the Lord ?
And the Gibeonites saide vnto him , We will haue no siluer nor golde of Saul , nor of his house , neither for vs shalt thou kill any man in Israel . And he said , What you shall say , that will I doe for you .
And they answered the king , The man that consumed vs , and that deuised against vs , that we should be destroied from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel ,
Let seuen men of his sonnes bee deliuered vnto vs , and wee will hang them vp vnto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul , whome the Lord did chuse . And the king said , I will giue them .
But the king spared Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul , because of the Lords othe that was between them , betweene Dauid , and Ionathan the sonne of Saul .
But the king tooke the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bare vnto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth , and the fiue sonnes of Michal the daughter of Saul , whome she brought vp for Adriel the sonne of Barzillai the Meholathite .
And hee deliuered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them in the hill before the Lord : and they fell all seuen together , and were put to death in the dayes of haruest , in the first dayes , in the beginning of barley haruest . ¶ And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah tooke sackecloth , and spread it for her vpon the rocke , from the beginning of haruest , vntill water dropped vpon them out of heauen , and suffered neither the birds of the aire to rest on them by day , nor the beastes of the fielde by night .
And it was tolde Dauid what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done . ¶ And Dauid went and tooke the bones of Saul , and the bones of Ionathan his sonne from the men of Iabesh Gilead , which had stollen them from the street of Bethshan where the Philistines had hanged them , when the Philistines had slaine Saul in Gilboa .
And hee brought vp from thence the bones of Saul , and the bones of Ionathan his sonne , and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged .
And the bones of Saul and Ionathan his sonne buried they in the countrey of Beniamin in Zelah , in the sepulchre of Kish his father : and they perfourmed all that the king commanded : and after that , God was entreated for the land .
¶ Moreouer , the Philistines had yet warre againe with Israel , and Dauid went down , and his seruants with him , and fought against the Philistines , and Dauid waxed faint .
And Ishbi - benob which was of the sonnes of the gyant , ( the weight of whose speare weighed three hundred shekels of brasse in weight ) he being girded with a new sword , thought to haue slaine Dauid .
But Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah succoured him , and smote the Philistine , and killed him . Then the men of Dauid sware vnto him , saying , Thou shalt goe no more out with vs to battell , that thou quench not the light of Israel .
And it came to passe after this , that there was againe a battell with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph , which was of the sonnes of the Gyant .
And there was againe a battell in Gob , with the Philistines , where Elhanan the sonne of Iaare - Oregim a Bethlehemite , slewe the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staffe of whose speare was like a weauers beame .
And there was yet a battell in Gath , where was a man of great stature , that had on euery hand sixe fingers , and on euery foote sixe toes , foure and twenty in number , and he also was borne to the Gyant .
And when he defied Israel , Ionathan the sonne of Shimea the brother of Dauid , slew him .
<NON-VERSE>
And Dauid spake vnto the Lord the wordes of this song , in the day that the Lord had deliuered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul .
And he said , The Lord is my rocke and my fortresse , and my deliuerer :
The God of my rocke , in him will I trust : hee is my shield , and the horne of my saluation , my high tower , and my refuge , my Sauiour ; thou sauest me from violence .
I will call on the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saued from mine enemies .
When the waues of death compassed me : the floods of vngodly men made me afraid .
The sorowes of Hell compassed me about : the snares of death preuented me .
In my distresse I called vpon the Lord , and cryed to my God , and hee did heare my voice out of his Temple , and my crie did enter into his eares .
Then the earth shooke and trembled : the foundations of heauen mooued and shooke , because hee was wroth .
There went vp a smoake out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth deuoured : coales were kindled by it .
Hee bowed the heauens also and came downe : and darkenesse was vnder his feete .
And he rode vpon a Cherub , and did flie : and hee was seene vpon the wings of the winde .
And hee made darkenesse pauilions round about him , darke waters , and thicke clouds of the skies .
Through the brightnesse before him , were coales of fire kindled .
The Lord thundred from heauen : and the most high vttered his voice .
And he sent out arrowes , and scattered them ; lightning , and discomfited them .
He deliuered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated mee : for they were too strong for me .
They preuented me in the day of my calamitie : but the Lord was my stay .
Hee brought me forth also into a large place : he deliuered me , because hee delighted in me .
Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me , according to my righteousnesse : according to my cleannesse in his eye sight . With the merciful thou wilt shew thy selfe mercifull , and with the vpright man thou wilt shew thy selfe vpright .
With the pure thou wilt shew thy selfe pure : and with the froward , thou wilt shew thy selfe vnsauoury .
And the afflicted people thou wilt saue : but thine eyes are vpon the hautie , that thou mayest bring them downe .
For thou art my lampe , O Lord : and the Lord wil lighten my darkenesse .
For by thee I haue run through a troupe : by my God haue I leaped ouer a wall .
As for God , his way is perfect , the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all them that trust in him .
For who is God , saue the Lord ? and who is a rocke , saue our God ?
God is my strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect .
Hee maketh my feet like hindes feet : and setteth mee vpon my high places .
He teacheth my hands to warre : so that a bow of steele is broken by mine armes .
Thou hast also giuen mee the shield of thy saluation : and thy gentlenesse hath made me great .
Thou hast enlarged my steps vnder me : so that my feet did not slip .
I haue pursued mine enemies , and destroyed them : and turned not againe vntill I had consumed them .
And I haue consumed them and wounded them , that they could not arise : yea , they are fallen vnder my feet .
For thou hast girded mee with strength to battel : them that rose vp against me , hast thou subdued vnder me .
Thou hast also giuen mee the necks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
They looked , but there was none to saue : euen vnto the Lord , but he answered them not .
Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth : I did stampe them as the myre of the street , and did spread them abroad .
Thou also hast deliuered mee from the striuings of my people , thou hast kept mee to be head of the heathen : a people which I knew not , shall serue me .
Strangers shall submit themselues vnto me : as soone as they heare , they shall be obedient vnto me .
Strangers shall fade away : and they shall bee afraid out of their close places .
The Lord liueth , and blessed be my rocke : and exalted be the God of the rocke of my saluation .
It is God that auengeth mee , and that bringeth downe the people vnder me :
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted mee vp on high aboue them that rose vp against me : thou hast deliuered me from the violent man .
Therefore I will giue thankes vnto thee , O Lord , among the heathen : and I will sing praises vnto thy Name .
<NON-VERSE>
Nowe these bee the last words of Dauid : Dauid the sonne of Iesse saide , and the man who was raised vp on high , the Anointed of the God of Iacob , and the sweet Psalmist of Israel , said ,
The spirit of the Lord spake by me , and his word was in my tongue .
The God of Israel said , the Rocke of Israel spake to me : he that ruleth ouer men must be iust , ruling in the feare of God :
And he shall be as the light of the morning , when the Sunne riseth , euen a morning , without cloudes ; as the tender grasse springing out of the earth by cleare shining after raine :
Although my house be not so with God : yet he hath made with mee an euerlasting couenant , ordred in al things and sure : for this is all my saluation , and all my desire , although he make it not to grow .
¶ But the sonnes of Belial shall bee all of them as thornes thrust away , because they cannot be taken with hands ,
But the man that shal touch them , must be fenced with yron , and the staffe of a speare , and they shall bee vtterly burnt with fire in the same place .
¶ These be the names of the mightie men whome Dauid had : The Tachmonite that sate in the seat , chiefe among the captaines , ( the same was Adino the Eznite : ) hee lift vp his speare against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
And after him was Eleazar the sonne of Dodo the Ahohite , one of the three mightie men with Dauid , when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battell , and the men of Israel were gone away .
He arose , and smote the Philistines vntill his hand was wearie , and his hand claue vnto the sword : and the Lord wrought a great victorie that day , and the people returned after him onely to spoile .
And after him was Shammah the sonne of Agee the Hararite : and the Philistines were gathered together into a troupe , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
But hee stood in the midst of the ground , and defended it , and slewe the Philistines : and the Lord wrought a great victorie .
And three of the thirtie chiefe went downe and came to Dauid in the haruest time , vnto the caue of Adullam : and the troupe of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
And Dauid was then in an holde , and the garison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem .
And Dauid longed , and said , Oh that one would giue mee drinke of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate .
And the three mightie men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the Well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and tooke it , and brought it to Dauid : neuerthelesse he would not drinke thereof , but powred it out vnto the Lord .
And he said , Be it farre from me , O Lord , that I should doe this : is not this the blood of the men that went in ieopardie of their liues ? therefore he would not drinke it . These things did these three mightie men .
And Abishai the brother of Ioab , the sonne of Zeruiah , was chiefe among three , and he lift vp his speare against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
Was hee not most honourable of three ? therefore he was their captaine : howbeit , hee attained not vnto the first three .
And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada the sonne of a valiant man , of Kabzeel , who had done many actes , he slew two lion - like men of Moab : hee went downe also , and slewe a Lyon in the middest of a pit in time of snow .
And he slew an Egyptian a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a speare in his hand ; but he went downe to him with a staffe , and plucked the speare out of the Egyptians hand , and slewe him with his owne speare .
These things did Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada , and had the name among three mightie men .
Hee was more honourable then the thirtie , but hee attained not to the first three : and Dauid set him ouer his guard .

And againe the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and hee mooued Dauid against them , to say , Goe , number Israel and Iudah .
For the king said to Ioab the captaine of the hoste , which was with him , Goe now through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan euen to Beer - sheba , and number ye the people , that I may know the number of the people .
And Ioab sayde vnto the King , Now the Lord thy God adde vnto the people ( how many soeuer they be ) an hundred folde , and that the eyes of my lorde the king may see it : but why doeth my lord the king delight in this thing ?
Notwithstanding , the kings word preuailed against Ioab , and against the captaines of the hoste : and Ioab and the captaines of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
¶ And they passed ouer Iordane , and pitched in Aroer , on the right side of the citie that lieth in the midst of the riuer of Gad , and toward Iazer .
Then they came to Gilead , and to the land of Tahtim - Hodshi ; and they came to Dan - Iaan , and about to Zidon ,
And came to the strong holde of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hiuites , and of the Canaanites : and they went out to the South of Iudah , euen to Beer - sheba .
So when they had gone through all the land , they came to Ierusalem at the ende of nine moneths , and twentie dayes .
And Ioab gaue vp the summe of the number of the people vnto the king , and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drewe the sword : and the men of Iudah were fiue hundred thousand men .
¶ And Dauids heart smote him , after that hee had numbred the people : and Dauid sayde vnto the Lord , I haue sinned greatly in that I haue done : and nowe I beseech thee , O Lord , take away the iniquitie of thy seruant , for I haue done very foolishly . For when Dauid was vp in the morning , the word of the Lord came vnto the Prophet Gad Dauids Seer , saying ,
Goe and say vnto Dauid , Thus saith the Lord , I offer thee three things ; chuse thee one of them , that I may doe it vnto thee .
So Gad came to Dauid , and told him , and said vnto him , Shall seuen yeeres of famine come vnto thee in thy land ? or wilt thou flee three moneths before thine enemies , while they pursue thee ? or that there be three dayes pestilence in thy land ? Now aduise , and see what answere I shall returne to him that sent me .
And Dauid saide vnto Gad , I am in a great strait : let vs fall now into the hand of the Lord ( for his mercies are great , ) and let me not fall into the hand of man .
¶ So the Lord sent a pestilence vpon Israel , from the morning , euen to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan euen to Beersheba , seuentie thousand men .
And when the Angel stretched out his hand vpon Ierusalem to destroy it , the Lord repented him of the euill , and said to the Angel that destroyed the people , It is ynough : stay now thine hand . And the Angel of the Lord was by the threshing place of Araunah the Iebusite .
And Dauid spake vnto the Lord when he saw the Angel that smote the people , and said , Loe , I haue sinned , and I haue done wickedly : but these sheepe , what haue they done ? Let thine hand , I pray thee , be against mee , and against my fathers house .
¶ And Gad came that day to Dauid , and said vnto him , Goe vp , reare an Altar vnto the Lord , in the threshing floore of Araunah the Iebusite .
And Dauid , according to the saying of Gad , went vp , as the Lord commanded .
And Araunah looked , and saw the King and his seruants comming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himselfe before the King on his face vpon the ground .
And Araunah said , Wherefore is my lord the King come to his seruant ? and Dauid saide , To buy the threshing floore of thee , to build an Altar vnto the Lord , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
And Araunah said vnto Dauid , Let my lord the King take and offer vp what seemeth good vnto him : Beholde , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments , and other instruments of the oxen for wood .
All these things did Araunah , as a king , giue vnto the King : and Araunah saide vnto the King , The Lord thy God accept thee .
And the King said vnto Araunah , Nay , but I will surely buy it of thee at a price : neither will I offer burnt offerings vnto the Lord my God , of that which doeth cost mee nothing . So Dauid bought the threshing floore , and the oxen , for fiftie shekels of siluer .

Wee are bound to thanke God alwayes for you , brethren , as it is meete , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charitie of euery one of you al towards each other aboundeth :
So that wee our selues glorie in you in the Churches of God , for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that yee endure .
Which is a manifest token of the righteous iudgement of God , that yee may bee counted worthy of the kingdome of God , for which yee also suffer ;
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you : And to you who are troubled , rest with vs , when the Lord Iesus shalbe reuealed from heauen , with his mightie Angels ,
In flaming fire , taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the Gospel of our Lorde Iesus Christ ,
Who shalbe punished with euerlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power :
When hee shall come to bee glorified in his Saints , and to bee admired in all them that beleeue ( because our testimony among you was beleeued ) in that day .
Wherefore also we pray alwayes for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodnesse , and the worke of faith with power :

Now wee beseech you , brethren , by the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ , and by our gathering together vnto him ,
That yee bee not soone shaken in minde , or bee troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter , as from vs , as that the day of Christ is at hand ,
Let no man deceiue you by any meanes , for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sinne bee reuealed , the sonne of perdition ,
Who opposeth and exalteth himselfe aboue all that is called God , or that is worshipped : so that he as God , sitteth in the Temple of God , shewing himselfe that he is God .
Remember yee not , that when I was yet with you , I tolde you these things ?
And now yee know what withholdeth , that hee might bee reuealed in his time .
For the mysterie of iniquitie doth alreadie worke : onely he who now letteth , will let , vntill he be taken out of the way .
And then shall that wicked bee reuealed , whome the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the brightnesse of his comming :
Euen him whose comming is after the working of Satan , with all power and signes , and lying wonders ,
And with all deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse , in them that perish : because they receiued not the loue of the trueth , that they might be saued .
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should beleeue a lye :
That they all might bee damned who beleeued not the trueth , but had pleasure in vnrighteousnes .
But we are bound to giue thanks alway to God for you , brethren , beloued of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to saluation , through sanctification of the spirit , and beleefe of the trueth ,
Whereunto he called you by our Gospel , to the obteining of the glorie of the Lord Iesus Christ .
Therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which yee haue beene taught , whether by word or our Epistle .
Now our Lorde Iesus Christ himselfe , and God euen our Father , which hath loued vs , and hath giuen vs euerlasting consolation , and good hope through grace ,

Finally , brethren , pray for vs , that the word of the Lord may haue free course , and be glorified , euen as it is with you :
And that we may bee deliuered from vnreasonable and wicked men : for all men haue not faith .
But the Lord is faithfull , who shall stablish you , and keepe you from euill .
And wee haue confidence in the Lord touching you , that yee both doe , and will doe the things which we command you .
And the Lord direct your hearts into the loue of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
Now we command you , brethren , in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ , that ye withdraw your selues from euery brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which hee receiued of vs .
For your selues know how yee ought to follow vs : for wee behaued not our selues disorderly among you ,
Neither did wee eate any mans bread for nought : but wrought with labour and trauaile night and day , that wee might not bee chargeable to any of you .
Not because we haue not power , but to make our selues an ensample vnto you to follow vs .
For euen when wee were with you , this wee commanded you , that if any would not worke , neither should he eate .
For we heare that there are some which walke among you disorderly , working not at all , but are busi - bodies .
Now them that are such , we command , and exhort by our Lord Iesus Christ , that with quietnesse they worke , and eat their owne bread .
But ye , brethren , be not wearie in well doing .
And if any man obey not our word , by this Epistle note that man , and haue no company with him , that he may be ashamed ,
Yet count him not as an enemie , but admonish him as a brother .
Now the Lord of peace himselfe , giue you peace alwayes , by all meanes . The Lord be with you all .

I thanke God , whom I serue from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I haue remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ,
Greatly desiring to see thee , being mindfull of thy teares , that I may bee filled with ioy ,
When I call to remembrance the vnfained faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice : and I am perswaded that in thee also .
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance , that thou stirre vp the gift of God which is in thee , by the putting on of my hands .
For God hath not giuen vs the spirit of feare , but of power , of loue , and of a sound minde .
Bee not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner , but bee thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God ,
Who hath saued vs , and called vs with an holy calling , not according to our workes , but according to his owne purpose and grace , which was giuen vs in Christ Iesus , before the world began ,
But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Sauiour Iesus Christ , who hath abolished death , and hath brought life and immortalitie to light , through the Gospel :
Whereunto I am appointed a Preacher , and an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
For the which cause I also suffer these things ; neuerthelesse , I am not ashamed : for I know whom I haue beleeued , and I am perswaded that he is able to keepe that which I haue committed vnto him against that day .
Holde fast the fourme of sound words , which thou hast heard of mee , in faith and loue , which is in Christ Iesus .
That good thing which was committed vnto thee , keepe , by the holy Ghost which dwelleth in vs .
This thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me , of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
The Lord giue mercie vnto the house of Onesiphorus , for hee oft refreshed mee , and was not ashamed of my chaine .
But when he was in Rome , hee sought mee out very diligently , and found me .

Remember that Iesus Christ of the seede of Dauid , was raised from the dead , according to my Gospel :
Wherein I suffer trouble as an euill doer , euen vnto bonds : but the word of God is not bound .
Therefore I indure all things for the elects sakes , that they may also obtaine the saluation which is in Christ Iesus , with eternall glory .
It is a faithfull saying : for if we bee dead with him , wee shall also liue with him .
If we suffer , we shall also reigne with him : if wee denie him , hee also will denie vs .
If we beleeue not , yet he abideth faithfull , he cannot denie himselfe .
Of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord , that they striue not about words to no profite , but to the subuerting of the hearers .
Studie to shewe thy selfe approued vnto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly diuiding the word of trueth .
But shun profane and vaine bablings , for they will increase vnto more vngodlinesse .
And their word will eate as doth a canker : of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus .
Who concerning the trueth haue erred , saying that the resurrection is past alreadie , and ouerthrow the faith of some .
Neuerthelesse the foundation of God standeth sure , hauing the seale , the Lord knoweth them that are his . And , let euery one that nameth the Name of Christ , depart from iniquitie .
But in a great house , there are not onely vessels of gold , and of siluer , but also a wood , & of earth : and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
If a man therefore purge himselfe from these , he shal be a vessell vnto honour , sanctified , and meete for the Masters vse , and prepared vnto euery good worke .
Flie also youthfull lusts : but follow righteousnesse , faith , charitie , peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
But foolish and vnlearned questions auoid , knowing that they doe gender strifes .
And the seruant of the Lord must not striue : but bee gentle vnto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
In meekenesse instructing those that oppose themselues , if God peraduenture will giue them repentance to the acknowledging of the trueth .

Traitours , heady , high minded , louers of pleasures more then louers of God ,
Hauing a forme of godlinesse , but denying the power thereof : from such turne away .
For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and leade captiue silly women laden with sinnes , led away with diuers lusts ,
Euer learning , and neuer able to come to the knowledge of the trueth .
Now as Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the trueth : men of corrupt mindes , reprobate concerning the faith .
But they shal proceede no further : for their folly shall be manifest vnto all men , as theirs also was .
But thou hast fully knowen my doctrine , maner of life , purpose , faith , long suffering , charitie , patience ,
Persecutions , afflictions which came vnto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra , what persecutions I indured : but out of them all the Lord deliuered me .
Yea , and all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus , shall suffer persecution .
But euill men and seducers shall waxe worse and worse , deceiuing , and being deceiued .
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned , and hast been assured of , knowing of whome thou hast learned them .
And that from a childe thou hast knowen the holy Scriptures , which are able to make thee wise vnto saluation through faith which is in Christ Iesus .
All Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God , & is profitable for doctrine , for reproofe , for correction , for instrution in righteousnesse ,

I charge thee therefore before God , and the Lord Iesus Christ , who shall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing , and his kingdome :
Preach the word , be instant in season , out of season , reprooue , rebuke , exhort with all long suffering & doctrine .
For the time wil come when they will not endure sound doctrine , but after their owne lusts shall they heape to themselues teachers , hauing itching eares :
And they shall turne away their eares from the trueth , and shall be turned vnto fables .
But watch thou in all things , indure afflictions , doe the worke of an Euangelist , make full proofe of thy ministery .
For I am now readie to bee offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
I haue fought a good fight , I haue finished my course , I haue kept the faith .
Hencefoorth there is layde vp for me a crowne of righteousnesse , which the Lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day : and not to me only , but vnto them also that loue his appearing .

Of whom bee thou ware also , for he hath greatly withstood our words .
At my first answere no man stood with mee , but all men forsooke mee : I pray God that it may not bee laid to their charge .
Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me , and strengthened me , that by me the preaching might be fully knowen , and that all the Gentiles might heare : and I was deliuered out of the mouth of the Lyon .
And the Lord shall deliuer mee from euery euill worke , and will preserue me vnto his heauenly kingdome ; to whom bee glory for euer , and euer . Amen .

The Elder vnto the welbeloued Gaius , whom I loue in the trueth :
Beloued , I wish aboue all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , euen as thy soule prospereth .
For I reioyced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , euen as thou walkest in the trueth .
I haue no greater ioy , then to heare that my children walke in truth .
Beloued , thou doest faithfully whatsoeuer thou doest to the Brethren , and to strangers :
Which haue borne witnesse of thy charitie before the Church : whome if thou bring forward on their iourney after a godly sort , thou shalt doe well :
Because that for his Names sake they went foorth , taking nothing of the Gentiles .
We therefore ought to receiue such , that we might be fellow helpers to the trueth .
I wrote vnto the Church , but Diotrephes , who loueth to haue the preeminence among them , receiueth vs not .
Wherefore if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against vs with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth hee himselfe receiue the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the Church .
Beloued , follow not that which is euill , but that which is good . He that doth good , is of God : but hee that doth euill , hath not seene God .

The former treatise haue I made , O Theophilus , of al that Iesus began both to doe and teach ,
Untill the day in which hee was taken vp , after that he through the holy Ghost had giuen commaundements vnto the Apostles , whom he had chosen .
To whom also he shewed himselfe aliue after his passion , by many infallible proofes , being seene of them fourty dayes , and speaking of the things perteining to the kingdome of God :
And being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Hierusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye haue heard of me .
For Iohn truely baptized with water , but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost , not many dayes hence .
When they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , Lord , wilt thou at this time restore againe the kingdome to Israel ?
And he said vnto them , It is not for you to knowe the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his owne power .
But ye shall receiue power after that the holy Ghost is come vpon you , and ye shall be witnesses vnto me , both in Hierusalem , and in all Iudea , and in Samaria , and vnto the vttermost part of the earth .
And when hee had spoken these things , while they beheld , hee was taken vp , and a cloud receiued him out of their sight .
And while they looked stedfastly toward heauen , as he went vp , behold , two men stood by them in white apparell ,
Which also said , Yee men of Galililee , why stand yee gazing vp into heauen ? This same Iesus , which is taken vp from you into heauen , shall so come , in like maner as yee haue seene him goe into heauen .
Then returned they vnto Hierusalem , from the mount called Oliuet , which is from Hierusalem a Sabbath dayes iourney .
And when they were come in , they went vp into an vpper roome , where abode both Peter & Iames , & Iohn , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , Iames the sonne of Alpheus , and Simon Zelotes , and Iudas the brother of Iames .
These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Iesus , and with his brethen .
¶ And in those dayes Peter stood vp in the mids of the disciples , and said , ( The number of names together were about an hundred and twentie )
Men and brethren , This Scripture must needs haue beene fulfilled , which the holy Ghost by the mouth of Dauid spake before concerning Iudas , which was guide to them that took Iesus .
For hee was numbred with vs , and had obtained part of this ministerie .
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity , and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the mids , and all his bowels gushed out .
And it was knowen vnto all the dwellers at Hierusalem , insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
For it is written in the booke of Psalmes , Let his habitation be desolate , and let no man dwell therein : And his Bishopricke let another take .
Wherefore of these men which haue companied with vs all the time that the Lord Iesus went in and out among vs ,
Beginning from the baptisme of Iohn , vnto that same day that he was taken vp from vs , must one be ordained to be a witnesse with vs of his resurrection .
And they appointed two , Ioseph called Barsabas , who was surnamed Iustus , and Matthias .
And they prayed , and said , Thou Lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
That hee may take part of this ministerie and Apostleship , from which Iudas by transgression fell , that hee might goe to his owne place .

And when the day of Pentecost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
And suddenly there came a sound from heauen as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
And there appeared vnto them clouen tongues , like as of fire , and it sate vpon each of them .
And they were all filled with the holy Ghost , and began to speake with other tongues , as the spirit gaue them vtterance .
And there were dwelling at Hierusalem Iewes , deuout men , out of euery nation vnder heauen .
Now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that euery man heard them speake in his owne language .
And they were all amazed , and marueiled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speake , Galileans ?
And how heare we euery man in our owne tongue , wherein we were borne ?
Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Iudea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia ,
Phrygia , and Pamphylia , in Egypt , and in the parts of Libya , about Cyrene , & strangers of Rome , Iewes and Proselites ,
Cretes , and Arabians , we doe heare them speake in our tongues the wonderfull workes of God .
And they were all amazed , and were in doubt , saying one to another , What meaneth this ?
Others mocking said , These men are full of new wine .
¶ But Peter standing vp with the eleuen , lift vp his voyce , and said vnto them , Ye men of Iudea , & all ye that dwell at Hierusalem , be this knowen vnto you , and hearken to my words :
For these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third houre of the day .
But this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Ioel ,
And it shall come to passe in the last dayes ( saith God ) I will powre out of my Spirit vpon all flesh : and your sonnes and your daughters shall prophesie , and your yong men shall see visions , and your old men shall dreame dreames :
And on my seruants , and on my handmaidens , I will powre out in those daies of my Spirit , and they shall prophesie :
And I wil shew wonders in heauen aboue , and signes in the earth beneath : blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke .
The Sunne shall be turned into darkenesse , and the Moone into blood , before that great and notable day of the Lord come .
And it shall come to passe , that whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the Lord , shalbe saued .
Yee men of Israel , heare these words , Iesus of Nazareth , a man approued of God among you , by miracles , wonders , and signes , which God did by him in the midst of you , as yee your selues also know :
Him , being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God , yee haue taken , and by wicked hands , haue crucified , and slaine :
Whom God hath raised vp , hauing loosed the paines of death : because it was not possible that hee should be holden of it .
For Dauid speaketh concerning him , I foresaw the Lord alwayes before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moued .
Therefore did my heart reioyce , and my tongue was glad : Moreouer also , my flesh shall rest in hope ,
Because thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy one to see corruption .
Thou hast made knowen to mee the wayes of life , thou shalt make mee full of ioy with thy countenance .
Men and brethren , let me freely speake vnto you of the Patriarch Dauid , that he is both dead & buried , and his sepulchre is with vs vnto this day :
Therefore being a Prophet , and knowing that God had sworne with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loines , according to the flesh , hee would raise vp Christ , to sit on his throne :
He seeing this before , spake of the resurrection of Christ , that his soule was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
This Iesus hath God raised vp , whereof we all are witnesses .
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and hauing receiued of the Father the promise of the holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and heare .
For Dauid is not ascended into the heauens , but he saith himselfe , The Lord said vnto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
Untill I make thy foes thy footstoole .
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly , that God hath made that same Iesus , whom ye haue crucified , both Lord and Christ .
¶ Now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said vnto Peter , and to the rest of the Apostles , Men and brethren , What shall we doe ?
Then Peter said vnto them , Repent , and be baptized euery one of you in the Name of Iesus Christ , for the remission of sinnes , and ye shal receiue the gift of the holy Ghost .
For the promise is vnto you , and to your children , and to all that are afarre off , euen as many as the Lord our God shall call .
And with many other words did hee testifie and exhort , saying , Saue your selues from this vntoward generation .
¶ Then they that gladly receiued his word , were baptized : and the same day there were added vnto them about three thousand soules .
And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in praiers .
And feare came vpon euery soule : and many wonders and signes were done by the Apostles .
And all that beleeued were together , and had all things common ,
And solde their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as euery man had need .
And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart ,
<NON-VERSE>
Nowe Peter and Iohn went vp together into the Temple at the houre of prayer , beeing the ninth houre .
And a certaine man lame from his mothers womb was caried , whom they laide daily at the gate of the Temple which is called Beautifull , to aske almes of them that entred into the Temple .
Who seeing Peter & Iohn about to go into the Temple , asked an almes .
And Peter fastening his eyes vpon him , with Iohn , said , Looke on vs .
And he gaue heede vnto them , expecting to receiue something of them .
Then Peter said , Siluer and gold haue I none , but such as I haue , giue I thee : In the Name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth , rise vp and walke .
And hee tooke him by the right hand , & lift him vp : aud immediatly his feete and ancle bones receiued strength .
And hee leaping vp , stood , and walked , and entred with them into the Temple , walking , and leaping , and praising God .
And all the people saw him walking , and praising God .
And they knew that it was hee which sate for almes at the beautifull gate of the Temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened vnto him .
And as the lame man which was healed , helde Peter and Iohn , all the people ranne together vnto them in the porch , that is called Solomons , greatly wondring .
¶ And when Peter sawe it , hee answered vnto the people , Yee men of Israel , why marueile ye at this ? or why looke yee so earnestly on vs , as though by our owne power or holinesse we had made this man to walke ?
The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Iacob , the God of our fathers hath glorified his sonne Iesus , whom ye deliuered vp , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when hee was determined to let him goe .
But ye denied the Holy one , and the Iust , and desired a murderer to be granted vnto you ,
And killed the Prince of life , whom God hath raised from the dead , whereof we are witnesses .
And his Name through faith in his Name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him , hath giuen him this perfect soundnesse in the presence of you all .
And now brethren , I wote that through ignorance yee did it , as did also your rulers .
But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his Prophets , that Christ should suffer , hee hath so fulfilled . ¶ Repent yee therefore , and bee conuerted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shal come from the presence of the Lord .
And hee shall send Iesus Christ , which before was preached vnto you .
Whom the heauen must receiue , vntill the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets since the world began .
For Moses truely said vnto the fathers , A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise vp vnto you of your brethren , like vnto me ; him shall yee heare in all things whatsoeuer he shal say vnto you .
And it shall come to passe , that euery soule which will not heare that Prophet , shalbe destroyed from among the people .
Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel , and those that follow after , as many as haue spoken , haue likewise foretold of these dayes .
Yee are the children of the Prophets , and of the couenant which God made with our fathers , saying vnto Abraham , And in thy seed shall all the kinreds of the earth be blessed .
<NON-VERSE>
And as they spake vnto the people , the Priests and the captaine of the Temple , and the Sadduces came vpon them ,
Being grieued that they taught the people , and preached through Iesus the resurrection from the dead .
And they laid hands on them , and put them in hold vnto the next day : for it was now euentide .
Howbeit , many of them which heard the word , beleeued , and the number of the men was about fiue thousand .
¶ And it came to passe on the morow , that their rulers , and Elders , and Scribes ,
And Annas the high Priest , and Caiphas , and Iohn , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kinred of the high Priest , were gathered together at Hierusalem .
And when they had set them in the middest , they asked , By what power , or by what name haue ye done this ?
Then Peter filled with the holy Ghost , said vnto them , Ye rulers of the people , and Elders of Israel ,
If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what meanes he is made whole ,
Be it knowen vnto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the Name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whome God raised from the dead , euen by him , doeth this man stand here before you , whole .
This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders , which is become the head of the corner .
Neither is there saluation in any other : for there is none other name vnder heauen giuen among men whereby we must be saued .
¶ Now when they sawe the boldnesse of Peter and Iohn , and perceiued that they were vnlearned and ignorant men , they marueiled , and they tooke knowledge of them , that they had bene with Iesus .
And beholding the man which was healed , standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the Council , they conferred among themselues ,
Saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath bene done by them , is manifest to all them that dwell in Hierusalem , and we cannot denie it .
But that it spread no farther among the people , let vs straitly threaten them , that they speake henceforth to no man in this Name .
And they called them , and commanded them , not to speake at all , nor teach in the Name of Iesus .
But Peter and Iohn answered , and said vnto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God , to hearken vnto you more then vnto God , iudge ye .
For wee cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard .
So when they had further threatned them , they let them goe , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde , on whome this miracle of healing was shewed .
¶ And being let goe , they went to their owne company , and reported all that the chiefe Priests and Elders had said vnto them .
And when they heard that , they lift vp their voyce to God with one accord , & said , Lord , thou art God which hast made heauen and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is ,
Who by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vaine things ?
The Kings of the earth stood vp , and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord , & against his Christ .
For of a trueth against thy holy child Iesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel were gathered together ,
For to doe whatsoeuer thy hand and thy counsell determined before to be done .
And now Lord , behold their threatnings , and graunt vnto thy seruants , that with all boldnesse they may speake thy word ,
By stretching foorth thine hand to heale : and that signes and wonders may be done by the Name of thy holy child Iesus .
¶ And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together , and they were all filled with the holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldnesse .
And the multitude of them that beleeued , were of one heart , and of one soule : Neither said any of them , that ought of the things which he possessed , was his owne , but they had all things common .
And with great power gaue the Apostles witnesse of the resurrection of the Lord Iesus , and great grace was vpon them all .
Neither was there any among them that lacked : For as many as were possessors of lands , or houses , sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were solde ,
And laide them downe at the Apostles feete : And distribution was made vnto euery man according as hee had neede .
And Ioses , who by the Apostles was surnamed Barnabas ( which is , being interpreted , The sonne of consolation ) a Leuite , and of the Countrey of Cyprus ,
<NON-VERSE>
But a certaine man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , solde a possession ,
And kept backe part of the price , his wife also being priuy to it , and brought a certaine part , and layd it at the Apostles feete .
But Peter said , Ananias , Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy Ghost , and to keepe backe part of the price of the land ?
Whiles it remained , was it not thine owne ? and after it was sold , was it not in thine owne power ? why hast thou conceiued this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not lied vnto men , but vnto God .
And Ananias hearing these words , fell downe , and gaue vp the ghost : and great feare came on all them that heard these things .
And the yong men arose , wound him vp , and caried him out , and buried him .
And it was about the space of three houres after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
And Peter answered vnto her , Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much . And she saide , Yea , for so much .
Then Peter saide vnto her , How is it that ye haue agreed together , to tempt the Spirit of the Lord ? behold , the feete of them which haue buried thy husband , are at the doore , and shall cary thee out .
Then fell she downe straightway at his feete , and yeelded vp the ghost : And the yong men came in , and found her dead , and carying her forth , buried her by her husband .
And great feare came vpon all the Church , and vpon as many as heard these things .
¶ And by the hands of the Apostles , were many signes and wonders wrought among the people . ( And they were all with one accord in Solomons porch .
And of the rest durst no man ioyne himselfe to them : But the people magnified them .
And beleeuers were the more added to the Lord , multitudes both of men and women . )
Insomuch that they brought foorth the sicke into the streetes , and layed them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by , might ouershadow some of them .
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem , bringing sicke folkes , and them which were vexed with vncleane spirits : and they were healed euery one .
¶ Then the high Priest rose vp , and al they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the Sadduces ) and were filled with indignation ,
And laid their hands on the Apostles , & put them in the common prison .
But the Angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doores , and brought them foorth , and said ,
Goe , stand and speake in the Temple to the people all the words of this life .
And when they heard that , they entred into the Temple early in the morning , & taught : but the high Priest came , and they that were with him , and called the Councill together , and all the Senate of the children of Israel , and sent to the prison to haue them brought .
But when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned , and told ,
Saying , The prison truely found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doores , but when we had opened , we found no man within .
Now when the high Priest , and the captaine of the Temple , and the chiefe Priests heard these things , they doubted of them wherunto this would grow .
Then came one , and told them , saying , Behold , the men whom ye put in prison , are standing in the Temple , and teaching the people .
Then went the captaine with the officers , and brought them without violence : ( For they feared the people , lest they should haue bene stoned . )
And when they had brought them , they set them before the Councill , and the high Priest asked them ,
Saying , Did not wee straitly command you , that you should not teach in this Name ? And behold , yee haue filled Hierusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this mans blood vpon vs .
¶ Then Peter , and the other Apostles answered , and saide , Wee ought to obey God rather then men .
The God of our fathers raised vp Iesus , whom yee slew and hanged on a tree .
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to bee a Prince and a Sauiour , for to giue repentance to Israel , and forgiuenesse of sinnes .
And we are his witnesses of these things , and so is also the holy Ghost , whom God hath giuen to them that obey him .
¶ When they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and tooke counsell to slay them .
Then stood there vp one in the Councill , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a doctour of Law , had in reputation among all the people , and commanded to put the Apostles forth a litle space ,
And said vnto them , Yee men of Israel , take heed to your selues , what ye intend to doe as touching these men .
For before these dayes rose vp Theudas , boasting himselfe to be some body , to whom a number of men , about foure hundred , ioyned themselues : who was slaine , and all , as many as obeied him , were scattered , & brought to nought .
But if it be of God , ye cannot ouerthrow it , lest haply yee be found euen to fight against God .
And to him they agreed : and when they had called the Apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speake in the Name of Iesus , and let them goe .
¶ And they departed from the presence of the Councill , reioycing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his Name .
<NON-VERSE>
And in those dayes when the number of the Disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrewes , because their widowes were neglected in the daily ministration .
Then the twelue called the multitude of the disciples vnto them , and said , It is not reason that we should leaue the word of God , and serue tables .
Wherefore brethren , looke ye out among you seuen men of honest report , full of the holy Ghost , and wisedome , whom we may appoint ouer this businesse .
But we will giue our selues continually to prayer , and to the ministerie of the word .
¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they chose Steuen , a man full of faith and of the holy Ghost , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Permenas , and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch .
Whom they set before the Apostles : and when they had praied , they layd their hands on them .
And the word of God encreased , and the number of the Disciples multiplied in Hierusalem greatly , and a great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith .
And Steuen full of faith and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
¶ Then there arose certaine of the Synagogue , which is called the Synagogue of the Libertines , and Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia , and of Asia , disputing with Steuen .
And they were not able to resist the wisedome and the spirit by which he spake .
Then they suborned men which said , We haue heard him speake blasphemous words against Moses , and against God .
And they stirred vp the people , and the Elders , and the Scribes , and came vpon him , and caught him , and brought him to the Councell ,
And set vp false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speake blasphemous words against this holy place , and the Law .
For we haue heard him say , that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , & shall change the Customes which Moses deliuered vs .
<NON-VERSE>
Then said the high Priest , Are these things so ?
And hee said , Men , brethren , and fathers , hearken : The God of glory appeared vnto our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he dwelt in Charran ,
And said vnto him , Get thee out of thy countrey , and from thy kinred , and come into the land which I shall shew thee .
Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans , and dwelt in Charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he remoued him into this lande wherein ye now dwell .
And he gaue him none inheritance in it , no not so much as to set his foote on : yet he promised that he would giue it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
And God spake on this wise , that his seede should soiourne in a strange land , and that they should bring them into bondage , and intreate them euill foure hundreth yeeres .
And the nation to whom they shal bee in bondage , will I iudge , saide God : And after that shall they come forth , and serue me in this place .
And he gaue him the couenant of Circumcision : and so Abraham begate Isaac , and circumcised him the eight day : and Isaac begate Iacob , and Iacob begate the twelue Patriarchs .
And the Patriarchs moued with enuie , sold Ioseph into Egypt : but God was with him ,
And deliuered him out of all his afflictions , and gaue him fauour and wisedome in the sight of Pharao king of Egypt : and he made him gouernour ouer Egypt and all his house .
Now there came a dearth ouer all the land of Egypt , and Chanaan , and great affliction , and our fathers found no sustenance .
But when Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
And at the second time Ioseph was made knowen to his brethren , and Iosephs kinred was made knowen vnto Pharao .
Then sent Ioseph , and called his father Iacob to him , and all his kinred , threescore and fifteeene soules .
So Iacob went downe into Egypt , and died , he and our fathers ,
And were caried ouer into Sichem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a summe of money of the sonnes of Emor the father of Sichem .
But when the time of the promise drew nigh , which God had sworne to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt ,
Till another king arose , which knew not Ioseph .
The same dealt subtilly with our kinred , and euill intreated our fathers , so that they cast out their yong children , to the end they might not liue .
In which time Moses was borne , and was exceeding faire , and nourished vp in his fathers house three moneths :
And when he was cast out , Pharaohs daughter tooke him vp , and nourished him for her owne sonne .
And Moses was learned in all the wisedome of the Egyptians , and was mightie in words and in deeds .
And when he was full forty yeres old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
And seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and auenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
For he supposed his brethren would haue vnderstood , how that God by his hand would deliuer them , but they vnderstood not .
And the next day he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue , and would haue set them at one againe , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren , Why doe yee wrong one to another ?
But hee that did his neighbour wrong , thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a Iudge ouer vs ?
Wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday ?
Then fled Moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of Madian , where he begate two sonnes .
And when fourtie yeeres were expired , there appeared to him in the wildernes of mount Sina , an Angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush .
When Moses saw it , he wondred at the sight : and as he drew neere to behold it , the voyce of the Lord came vnto him ,
Saying , I am the God of thy fathers , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Iacob . Then Moses trembled , and durst not behold .
Then said the Lord to him , Put off thy shooes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest , is holy ground .
I haue seene , I haue seene the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I haue heard their groning , & am come downe to deliuer them : And now come , I will send thee into Egypt .
This Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a Iudge ? the same did God send to bee a ruler and a deliuerer , by the handes of the Angel which appeared to him in the bush .
He brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signes in the land of Egypt , and in the red Sea , and in the wildernesse fortie yeeres .
¶ This is that Moses which said vnto the children of Israel , A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise vp vnto you of your brethren , like vnto mee : him shall ye heare .
This is he that was in the Church in the wildernesse with the Angel , which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who receiued the liuely oracles , to giue vnto vs .
To whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned backe againe into Egypt ,
Saying vnto Aaron , Make vs gods to goe before vs . For as for this Moses , which brought vs out of the land of Egypt , we wote not what is become of him .
And they made a calfe in those dayes , and offered sacrifice vnto the idole , and reioyced in the workes of their owne hands .
Then God turned , and gaue them vp to worship the hoste of heauen , as it is written in the booke of the Prophets , O ye house of Israel , haue ye offered to me slaine beasts , and sacrifices , by the space of fourty yeeres in the wildernesse ?
Yea , ye tooke vp the Tabernacle of Moloch , and the starre of your God Remphan , figures which ye made , to worship them : and I will carie you away beyond Babylon .
Our fathers had the Tabernacle of witnesse in the wildernesse , as hee had appointed , speaking vnto Moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seene .
Which also our fathers that came after , brought in with Iesus into the possession of the Gentiles , whom God draue out before the face of our fathers , vnto the dayes of Dauid ,
Who found fauour before God , and desired to find a Tabernacle for the God of Iacob .
But Solomon built him an house .
Howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands , as saith the Prophet ,
Heauen is my throne , and earth is my footestoole : What house will ye build me , saith the Lord ? Or what is the place of my rest ?
Hath not my hand made all these things ?
¶ Ye stifnecked and vncircumcised in heart , and eares , ye doe alwayes resist the holy Ghost ? as your fathers did , so doe ye .
Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted ? And they haue slaine them which shewed before of the comming of the Iust one , of whom ye haue bene now the betrayers and murderers :
Who haue receiued the Lawe by the disposition of Angels , and haue not kept it .
¶ When they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
But hee being full of the holy Ghost , looked vp stedfastly into heauen , and saw the glory of God , and Iesus standing on the right hand of God ,
And said , Behold , I see the heauens opened , and the Sonne of man standing on the right hand of God .
Then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their eares , and ran vpon him with one accord ,
And cast him out of the citie , and stoned him : and the witnesses layd downe their clothes at a yong mans feete , whose name was Saul .
And they stoned Steuen , calling vpon God , and saying , Lord Iesus receiue my spirit .
<NON-VERSE>
And Saul was consenting vnto his death . And at that time there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Hierusalem , and they were all scattered abroad through out the regions of Iudea , and Samaria , except the Apostles .
And deuout men carried Steuen to his buriall , and made great lamentation ouer him .
As for Saul , he made hauocke of the Church , entring into euery house , and hailing men and women , committed them to prison .
Therefore they that were scattered abroad , went euery where preaching the word .
Then Philip went downe to the citie of Samaria , and preached Christ vnto them .
And the people with one accord gaue heed vnto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
For vncleane spirits , crying with lowd voyce , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
And there was great ioy in that citie .
But there was a certaine man called Simon , which before time in the same citie vsed sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giuing out that himselfe was some great one .
To whom they all gaue heed from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is the great power of God .
And to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
But when they beleeued Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdome of God , and the Name of Iesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
Then Simon himselfe beleeued also : and when hee was baptized , hee continued with Philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signes which were done .
Now when the Apostles which were at Hierusalem , heard that Samaria had receiued the word of God , they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn .
Who when they were come downe , praied for them that they might receiue the holy Ghost .
( For as yet hee was fallen vpon none of them : onely they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus . )
Then layde they their hands on them , and they receiued the holy Ghost .
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands , the holy Ghost was giuen , hee offered them money ,
Saying , Giue me also this power , that on whomsoeuer I lay handes , hee may receiue the holy Ghost .
But Peter said vnto him , Thy money perish with thee , because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money .
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter , for thy heart is not right in the sight of God .
Repent therefore of this thy wickednesse , and pray God , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee .
For I perceiue that thou art in the gall of bitternesse , and in the bond of iniquitie .
Then answered Simon , and said , Pray ye to the Lord for mee , that none of these things which ye haue spoken , come vpon me .
And they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Hierusalem , and preached the Gospel in many villages of the Samaritanes .
And the Angel of the Lord spake vnto Philip , saying , Arise , and goe toward the South , vnto the way that goeth downe from Hierusalem vnto Gaza , which is desert .
And hee arose , and went : and behold , a man of Ethiopia , an Eunuch of great authority vnder Candace queene of the Ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Hierusalem for to worship ,
Was returning , and sitting in his charet , read Esaias the Prophet .
Then the Spirit saide vnto Philip , Goe neere , and ioyne thy selfe to this charet .
And Philip ran thither to him , and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias , and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ?
And hee said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? And he desired Philip , that hee would come vp , and sit with him .
The place of the Scripture , which hee read , was this , Hee was led as a sheepe to the slaughter , & like a Lambe dumbe before the shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
In his humiliation , his Iudgement was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? For his life is taken from the earth .
And the Eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the Prophet this ? of himselfe , or of some other man ?
Then Philip opened his mouth , and began at the same Scripture , and preached vnto him Iesus .
And Philip said , If thou beleeuest with all thine heart , thou mayest . And he answered , and said , I beleeue that Iesus Christ is the Sonne of God .
And he commanded the charet to stand still : and they went downe both into the water , both Philip , and the Eunuch , and he baptized him .
And when they were come vp out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the Eunuch saw him no more : and hee went on his way reioycing .
<NON-VERSE>
And Saul yet breathing out threatnings & slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went vnto the high Priest ,
And desired of him letters to Damascus , to the Synagogues , that if hee found any of this way , whether they were men or women , hee might bring them bound vnto Hierusalem .
And as he iourneyed he came neere Damascus , and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heauen .
And he fel to the earth , and heard a voice saying vnto him , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
And he said , Who art thou Lord ? And the Lord said , I am Iesus whom thou persecutest : It is hard for thee to kicke against the prickes .
And he trembling and astonished , said , Lord , what wilt thou haue mee to doe ? And the Lord said vnto him , Arise , and goe into the citie , and it shall be told thee what thou must doe .
And the men which iourneyed with him , stood speechlesse , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
And Saul arose from the earth , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
And he was three dayes without sight , and neither did eate , nor drinke .
¶ And there was a certaine disciple at Damascus , named Ananias , and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias . And he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
And the Lord said vnto him , Arise , and goe into the street , which is called Straight , and inquire in the house of Iudas , for one called Saul of Tarsus : for behold , he prayeth ,
And hath seene in a vision a man named Ananias , comming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receiue his sight .
Then Ananias answered , Lord , I haue heard by many of this man , how much euill hee hath done to thy Saints at Hierusalem :
And here he hath authoritic from the chiefe Priests , to binde all that call on thy Name .
But the Lord said vnto him , Goe thy way : for hee is a chosen vessell vnto me , to beare my Name before the Gentiles , and Kings , and the children of Israel .
For I will shew him how great things hee must suffer for my Names sake .
And Ananias went his way , and entred into the house , and putting his hands on him , said , Brother Saul , the Lord ( euen Iesus that appeared vnto thee in the way as thou camest ) hath sent me , that thou mightest receiue thy sight , and be filled with the holy Ghost .
And immediatly there fell from his eyes as it had bene scales , and he receiued sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
And when hee had receiued meat , he was strengthened . Then was Saul certaine dayes with the disciples which were at Damascus .
And straightway hee preached Christ in the Synagogues , that hee is the Sonne of God .
But all that heard him , were amazed , and said , Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this Name in Hierusalem , and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound vnto the chiefe Priests ?
But Saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the Iewes which dwelt at Damascus , proouing that this is very Christ .
¶ And after that many dayes were fulfilled , the Iewes tooke counsel to kill him .
But their laying awaite was knowen of Saul : and they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
Then the disciples tooke him by night , and let him downe by the wall in a basket .
And when Saul was come to Hierusalem , he assayed to ioyne himselfe to the disciples , but they were all afraid of him , and beleeued not that he was a disciple .
But Barnabas tooke him , and brought him to the Apostles , and declared vnto them how hee had seene the Lord in the way , and that hee had spoken to him , and how hee had preached boldly at Damascus in the Name of Iesus . And he was with them comming in , and going out at Hierusalem .
And he spake boldly in the Name of the Lord Iesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
Which when the brethren knewe , they brought him downe to Cesarea , and sent him foorth to Tarsus .
Then had the Churches rest thorowout all Iudea , and Galilee , and Samaria , and were edified , and walking in the feare of the Lord , and in the comfort of the holy Ghost , were multiplied .
¶ And it came to passe , as Peter passed thorowout all quarters , he came downe also to the Saints , which dwelt at Lydda .
And there he found a certaine man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight yeeres , and was sicke of the palsie .
And Peter said vnto him , Aeneas , Iesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . And he arose immediately .
And all that dwelt at Lydda , and Saron , saw him , and turned to the Lord .
¶ Now there was at Ioppa a certain disciple , named Tabitha , which by interpretation is called Dorcas : This woman was full of good works , and almes deeds , which she did .
And it came to passe in those dayes that she was sicke , and died : whome when they had washed , they laid her in an vpper chamber .
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Ioppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent vnto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
Then Peter arose and went with them : when he was come , they brought him into the vpper chamber : And all the widowes stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made , while shee was with them .
But Peter put them all forth , and kneeled downe , and prayed , and turning him to the body , said , Tabitha , arise . And she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sate vp .
And he gaue her his hand , and lift her vp : and when hee had called the Saints & widowes , presented her aliue .
And it was knowen thorowout all Ioppa , and many beleeued in the Lord .

There was a certaine man in Cesarea , called Cornelius , a Centurion of the band called the Italian band ,
A deuout man , and one that feared God with all his house , which gaue much almes to the people , and prayed to God alway .
He saw in a vision euidently , about the ninth houre of the day , an Angel of God comming in to him , and saying vnto him Cornelius .
And when he looked on him , hee was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? And he said vnto him , Thy praiers and thine almes are come vp for a memorial before God .
And now send men to Ioppa , and call for one Simon , whose sirname is Peter .
Hee lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner , whose house is by the Sea side ; he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe .
And when the Angel which spake vnto Cornelius , was departed , he called two of his houshold seruants , and a deuout souldier of them that waited on him continually .
And when he had declared all these things vnto them , he sent them to Ioppa .
¶ On the morrow as they went on their iourney , and drew nigh vnto the citie , Peter went vp vpon the house to pray , about the sixth houre .
And he became very hungry , and would haue eaten : But while they made ready , he fell into a traunce ,
And saw heauen opened , and a certaine vessell descending vnto him , as it had beene a great sheete , knit at the foure corners , and let downe to the earth :
Wherein were all maner of foure footed beasts of the earth , and wilde beasts , and creeping things , and foules of the ayre .
And there came a voyce to him , Rise , Peter : kill , and eate .
But Peter said , Not so , Lord ; for I haue neuer eaten any thing that is common or vncleane .
And the voice spake vnto him againe the second time , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
This was done thrise : & the vessel was receiued vp againe into heauen .
Now while Peter doubted in himselfe what this vision which he had seene , should meane : behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius , had made inquirie for Simons house , and stood before the gate ,
And called , and asked whether Simon , which was sirnamed Peter , were lodged there .
¶ While Peter thought on the vision , the spirit said vnto him , Behold , three men seeke thee .
Arise therefore , and get thee downe , and goe with them , doubting nothing : for I haue sent them .
Then Peter went downe to the men , which were sent vnto him from Cornelius , and said , Behold , I am hee , whom ye seeke : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
And they saide , Cornelius the Centurion , a iust man , and one that feareth God , and of good report among all the nation of the Iewes , was warned from God by an holy Angel , to send for thee into his house , and to heare words of thee .
Then called he them in , and lodged them : And on the morrowe Peter went away with them , and certaine brethren from Ioppa accompanied him .
And the morrow after they entred into Cesarea : and Cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and neere friends .
And as Peter was comming in , Cornelius met him , and fell downe at his feete , and worshipped him .
But Peter tooke him vp , saying , Stand vp , I my selfe also am a man .
And as he talked with him , hee went in , and found many that were come together .
And he said vnto them , Ye know how that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is a Iewe , to keepe company or come vnto one of another nation : but God hath shewed me , that I should not call any man common or vncleane .
Therfore came I vnto you without gainesaying , as soone as I was sent for . I aske therefore , for what intent ye haue sent for me .
And Cornelius said , Foure daies agoe I was fasting vntill this houre , and at the ninth houre I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
And said , Cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine almes are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
Send therfore to Ioppa , and call hither Simon , whose sirname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a Tanner , by the Sea side , who when he commeth , shall speake vnto thee .
Immediately therefore I sent to thee , and thou hast well done , that thou art come . Now therefore are we all heere present before God , to heare all things that are commanded thee of God .
¶ Then Peter opened his mouth , and said , Of a trueth I perceiue that God is no respecter of persons :
But in euery nation , he that feareth him , and worketh righteousnesse , is accepted with him .
The word which God sent vnto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Iesus Christ ( he is Lord of all . )
That word ( I say ) you knowe which was published thorowout all Iudea , and began from Galilee , after the baptisme which Iohn preached :
How God anointed Iesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost , and with power , who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the deuill : for God was with him .
And we are witnesses of all things which hee did both in the land of the Iewes , and in Hierusalem , whom they slew and hanged on a tree ,
Him God raised vp the third day , and shewed him openly ,
Not to all the people , but vnto witnesses , chosen before of God , euen to vs who did eate and drinke with him after he rose from the dead .
And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people , and to testifie that it is he which was ordeined of God to be the Iudge of quicke and dead .
To him giue all the Prophets witnesse , that through his Name whosoeuer beleeueth in him , shall receiue remission of sinnes .
¶ While Peter yet spake these words , the holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
And they of the circumcision which beleeued , were astonished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was powred out the gift of the holy Ghost .
For they heard them speake with tongues , and magnifie God . Then answered Peter ,
Can any man forbid water , that these should not bee baptized , which haue receiued the holy Ghost , as well as wee ?
<NON-VERSE>
Saying , Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised , & didst eate with them .
But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order vnto them , saying ,
I was in the citie of Ioppa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision , a certaine vessell descend , as it had beene a great sheete , let downe from heauen by foure corners , and it came euen to me .
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw foure footed beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and foules of the aire .
And I heard a voyce , saying vnto me , Arise Peter , slay , and eate .
But I said , Not so , Lord : for nothing common or vncleane hath at any time entred into my mouth .
But the voyce answered me againe from heauen , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
And this was done three times : and all were drawen vp againe into heauen .
And behold , immediately there were three men already come vnto the house where I was , sent from Cesarea vnto me .
And the spirit bad me goe with them , nothing doubting : Moreouer , these sixe brethren accompanied me , and we entred into the mans house :
And he shewed vs how hee had seene an Angell in his house , which stood and said vnto him , Send men to Ioppa , and call for Simon , whose sirname is Peter :
Who shall tell thee words , wherby thou , and all thy house shal be saued .
And as I began to speake , the holy Ghost fell on them , as on vs at the beginning .
Then remembred I the word of the Lord , how that he said , Iohn indeede baptized with water : but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost .
Forasmuch then as God gaue them the like gift as hee did vnto vs , who beleeued on the Lord Iesus Christ : what was I that I could withstand God ?
When they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance vnto life .
¶ Now they which were scattered abroad vpon the persecution that arose about Steuen , trauailed as farre as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none , but vnto the Iewes onely .
And some of them were men of Cyprus , and Cyrene , which when they were come to Antioch , spake vnto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Iesus .
And the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number beleeued , and turned vnto the Lord .
¶ Then tidings of these things came vnto the eares of the Church , which was in Hierusalem : and they sent foorth Barnabas , that hee should goe as farre as Antioch .
Who when hee came , and had seene the grace of God , was glad , and exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would cleaue vnto the Lord .
For he was a good man , and full of the holy Ghost , and of faith : and much people was added vnto the Lord .
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus , for to seeke Saul .
And when he had found him , he brought him vnto Antioch . And it came to passe , that a whole yeere they assembled themselues with the Church , and taught much people , and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch .
¶ And in these dayes , came Prophets from Hierusalem vnto Antioch .
And there stood vp one of them , named Agabus , and signified by the spirit , that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to passe in the dayes of Claudius Cesar .
Then the disciples , euery man according to his abilitie , determined to send reliefe vnto the brethren which dwelt in Iudea .
<NON-VERSE>
Now about that time , Herode the King stretched foorth his hands , to vexe certaine of the Church .
And he killed Iames the brother of Iohn with the sword .
And because he saw it pleased the Iewes , hee proceeded further , to take Peter also . ( Then were the dayes of vnleauened bread . )
And when hee had apprehended him , hee put him in prison , and deliuered him to foure quaternions of souldiers to keepe him , intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison , but prayer was made without ceasing of the Church vnto God for him .
And when Herode would haue brought him foorth , the same night Peter was sleeping betweene two Souldiers , bound with two chaines , and the Keepers before the doore kept the prison .
And beholde , the Angel of the Lord came vpon him , and a light shined in the prison : and hee smote Peter on the side , and raised him vp , saying , Arise vp quickely . And his chaines fell off from his hands .
And the Angel said vnto him , Girde thy selfe , and binde on thy sandales : And so he did . And he sayth vnto him , Cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
And hee went out , and followed him , and wist not that it was true which was done by the Angel : but thought he saw a vision .
When they were past the first and the second ward , they came vnto the yron gate that leadeth vnto the citie , which opened to them of his owne accord : and they went out and passed on thorow one streete , and foorthwith the Angel departed from him .
And when Peter was come to himselfe , hee said , Now I know of a suretie , that the Lord hath sent his Angel , and hath deliuered mee out of the hand of Herode , and from all the expectation of the people of the Iewes .
And when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of Iohn whose sirname was Marke , where many were gathered together praying .
And as Peter knocked at the doore of the gate , a damosell came to hearken , named Rhoda .
And when she knew Peters voice , she opened not the gate for gladnes , but ran in , and told how Peter stood before the gate .
And they said vnto her , Thou art mad . But she constantly affirmed that it was euen so . Then said they , It it his Angel .
But Peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the doore , and saw him , they were astonished .
But he beckening vnto them with the hand , to hold their peace , declared vnto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison : And he said , Goe shew these things vnto Iames , and to the brethren . And he departed , and went into another place .
Now assoone as it was day , there was no smal stirre among the souldiers , what was become of Peter .
And when Herode had sought for him , and found him not , hee examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . And hee went downe from Iudea to Cesarea , & there abode .
¶ And Herode was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon : but they came with one accord to him , and hauing made Blastus the kings chamberlaine their friend , desired peace , because their countrey was nourished by the kings countrey .
And vpon a set day Herod arayed in royall apparell , sate vpon his throne , and made an Oration vnto them .
And the people gaue a shout , saying , It is the voice of a God , and not of a man .
And immediatly the Angel of the Lord smote him , because hee gaue not God the glory , and hee was eaten of wormes , and gaue vp the ghost .
¶ But the word of God grewe , and multiplied .
<NON-VERSE>
Nowe there were in the Church that was at Antioch , certaine Prophets and teachers : as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had bene brought vp with Herod the Tetrarch , and Saul .
As they ministred to the Lord , and fasted , the holy Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul , for the worke whereunto I haue called them .
And when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their handes on them , they sent them away .
¶ So they being sent forth by the holy Ghost , departed vnto Seleucia , and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
And when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the Synagogues of the Iewes : and they had also Iohn to their Minister .
And when they had gone thorow the Ile vnto Paphos , they found a certaine sorcerer , a false prophet , a Iewe , whose name was Bariesus :
Which was with the deputie of the countrey Sergius Paulus , a prudent man : who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to heare the word of God .
But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turne away the deputy from the faith .
Then Saul ( who also is called Paul ) filled with the holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
And said , O full of all subtilty and all mischiefe , thou child of the deuil , thou enemie of all righteousnesse , wilt thou not cease to peruert the right wayes of the Lord ?
And now behold , the hand of the Lord is vpon thee , & thou shalt be blind , not seeing the Sunne for a season . And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkenes , and he went about , seeking some to lead him by the hand .
Then the Deputie when he sawe what was done , beleeued , being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord .
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and Iohn departing from them , returned to Hierusalem .
¶ But when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sate downe .
And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent vnto them , saying , Ye men and brethren , if ye haue any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
Then Paul stood vp , and beckning with his hand , said , Men of Israel , and ye that feare God , giue audience .
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt , and with an high arme brought he them out of it .
And about the time of fourtie yeeres suffered he their maners in the wildernesse .
And when he had destroyed seuen nations in the land of Chanaan , he diuided their land to them by lot :
And after that he gaue vnto them iudges , about the space of foure hundred and fifty yeeres vntill Samuel the Prophet .
And afterward they desired a King , and God gaue vnto them Saul the sonne of Cis , a man of the tribe of Beniamin , by the space of fourty yeres .
And when he had remoued him , hee raised vp vnto them Dauid to be their king , to whom also he gaue testimonie , and said , I haue found Dauid the sonne of Iesse , a man after mine own heart , which shal fulfill all my wil .
Of this mans seed hath God , according to his promise , raised vnto Israel a Sauiour , Iesus :
When Iohn had first preached before his coming , the baptisme of repentance to all the people of Israel .
And as Iohn fulfilled his course , he said , Whom thinke ye that I am ? I am not he . But behold , there commeth one after me , whose shooes of his feete I am not worthy to loose .
Men and brethren , children of the stocke of Abraham , and whosoeuer among you feareth God , to you is the word of this saluation sent .
For they that dwell at Hierusalem , & their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the Prophets which are read euery Sabbath day , they haue fulfilled them in condemning him .
And though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they Pilate that he should be slaine .
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they tooke him downe from the tree , and layd him in a Sepulchre .
But God raised him from the dead :
And he was seene many dayes of them which came vp with him from Galilee to Hierusalem , who are his witnesses vnto the people .
And we declare vnto you glad tidings , how that the promise which was made vnto the fathers ,
God hath fulfilled the same vnto vs their children , in that he hath raised vp Iesus againe , as it is also written in the second Psalme : Thou art my Sonne , this day haue I begotten thee .
And as concerning that he raised him vp from the dead , now no more to returne to corruption , he said on this wise , I will giue you the sure mercies of Dauid .
Wherfore he saith also in another Psalme , Thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
For Dauid after he had serued his owne generation by the will of God , fell on sleepe , and was laide vnto his fathers , and saw corruption :
But hee whom God raised againe , saw no corruption . ¶ Be it knowen vnto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached vnto you the forgiuenesse of sinnes .
And by him all that beleeue , are iustified from all things , from which ye could not be iustified by the Law of Moses .
Beware therefore , least that come vpon you which is spoken of in the Prophets ,
Behold , yee despisers , and wonder , and perish : for I worke a worke in your dayes , a worke which you shall in no wise beleeue , though a man declare it vnto you .
And when the Iewes were gone out of the Synagogue , the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
Now when the Congregation was broken vp , many of the Iewes , and religious Proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas , who speaking to them , perswaded them to continue in the grace of God .
¶ And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together to heare the word of God .
But when the Iewes saw the multitudes , they were filled with enuie , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting , and blaspheming .
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first haue bene spoken to you : but seeing yee put it from you , and iudge your selues vnworthy of euerlasting life , loe , we turne to the Gentiles .
For so hath the Lord commanded vs , saying , I haue set thee to bee a light of the Gentiles , that thou shouldest be for saluation vnto the ends of the earth .
And when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordeined to eternall life , beleeued .
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region .
But the Iewes stirred vp the deuout and honourable women , and the chiefe men of the citie , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
But they shooke off the dust of their feete against them , and came vnto Iconium .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe in Iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the Iewes , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the Iewes , and also of the Greekes , beleeued .
But the vnbeleeuing Iewes stirred vp the Gentiles , and made their mindes euill affected against the brethren .
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gaue testimonie vnto the word of his grace , and granted signes and wonders to be done by their hands .
But the multitude of the city was diuided : and part held with the Iewes , and part with the Apostles .
And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles , and also of the Iewes , with their rulers , to vse them despitefully , and to stone them , They were ware of it , and fled vnto Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and vnto the region that lyeth round about .
And there they preached the Gospell .
¶ And there sate a certaine man at Lystra , impotent in his feete , being a creeple from his mothers wombe , who neuer had walked .
The same heard Paul speake : who stedfastly beholding him , and perceiuing that he had faith to be healed ,
Said with a lowd voice , Stand vpright on thy feete ; And he leaped and walked .
And when the people saw what Paul had done , they lift vp their voyces , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come downe to vs in the likenesse of men .
And they called Barnabas Iupiter , and Paul Mercurius , because hee was the chiefe speaker .
Then the priest of Iupiter , which was before their city , brought oxen , and garlands vnto the gates , and would haue done sacrifice with the people .
Which when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul heard of , they rent their clothes , and ranne in among the people , crying out ,
And saying , Sirs , Why doe yee these things ? Wee also are men of like passions with you , and preach vnto you , that ye should turne from these vanities , vnto the liuing God , which made heauen and earth , and the sea , and all things that are therein .
Who in times past , suffred all nations to walke in their owne wayes .
Neuerthelesse , he left not himselfe without witnesse , in that he did good , and gaue vs raine from heauen , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladnesse .
And with these sayings scarse restrained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice vnto them .
¶ And there came thither certaine Iewes from Antioch and Iconium , who perswaded the people , and hauing stoned Paul , drew him out of the citie , supposing he had beene dead .
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose vp , and came into the citie , and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
And when they had preached the Gospel to that city , and had taught many , they returned againe to Lystra , and to Iconium , and Antioch ,
Confirming the soules of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , aud that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdome of God .
And when they had preached the word in Perga , they went downe into Attalia ,
And thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God , for the worke which they fulfilled .
And when they were come , and had gathered the Church together , they rehearsed all that God had done with them , and how he had opened the doore of faith vnto the Gentiles .
<NON-VERSE>
And certaine men which came downe from Iudea , taught the brethren , and said , Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses , ye cannot be saued .
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissention and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certeine other of them , should goe vp to Hierusalem vnto the Apostles and Elders about this question .
And being brought on their way by the Church , they passed thorow Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conuersion of the Gentiles : and they caused great ioy vnto all the brethren .
And when they were come to Hierusalem , they were receiued of the Church , and of the Apostles , and Elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
But there rose vp certaine of the sect of the Pharisees which beleeued , saying , that it was needfull to circumcise them , and to command them to keepe the Law of Moses .
¶ And the Apostles & Elders came together for to consider of this matter .
And when there had bene much disputing , Peter rose vp , and said vnto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while agoe , God made choise among vs , that the Gentiles by my mouth should heare the worde of the Gospel , and beleeue .
And God which knoweth the hearts , bare them witnes , giuing them the holy Ghost , euen as he did vnto vs ,
And put no difference between vs & them , purifying their hearts by faith .
Now therfore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke vpon the necke of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to beare ?
But we beleeue that through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ , we shal be saued euen as they .
¶ Then all the multitude kept silence , and gaue audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
¶ And after they had helde their peace , Iames answered , saying , Men and brethren , hearken vnto me .
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visite the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his Name .
And to this agree the words of the Prophets , as it is written ,
After this I will returne , and wil build againe the Tabernacle of Dauid , which is fallen downe : and I will build againe the ruines thereof , and I will set it vp :
That the residue of men might seeke after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , vpon whom my Name is called , sayth the Lord , who doeth all these things . Knowen vnto God are all his workes from the beginning of the world .
Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God :
But that wee write vnto them , that they abstaine from pollutions of Idoles , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preach him , being read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day .
Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church , to send chosen men of their owne company to Antioch , with Paul and Barnabas : namely , Iudas surnamed Barsabas , & Silas , chiefe men among the brethren ,
And wrote letters by them after this maner , The Apostles and Elders , and brethren , send greeting vnto the brethren , which are of the Gentiles in Antioch , and Syria , and Cilicia .
Forasmuch as we haue heard , that certaine which went out from vs , haue troubled you with words , subuerting your soules , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keepe the Law , to whom we gaue no such commandement :
It seemed good vnto vs , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men vnto you , with our beloued Barnabas and Paul ,
Men that haue hazarded their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ .
Wee haue sent therefore Iudas and Silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
For it seemed good to the holy Ghost , and to vs , to lay vpon you no greater burden then these necessarie things ;
That ye abstaine from meates offered to idoles , and from blood , & from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keepe your selues , yee shall doe well . Fare ye well .
So when they were dismissed , they came to Antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they deliuered the Epistle .
Which when they had read , they reioyced for the consolation .
And Iudas and Silas , being Prophets also themselues , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them :
And after they had taried there a space , they were let goe in peace from the breehren vnto the Apostles . Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still .
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
¶ And some dayes after , Paul said vnto Barnabas , Let vs go againe and visit our brethren , in euery city where we haue preached the word of the Lord , and see how they doe .
And Barnabas determined to take with them Iohn , whose surname was Marke .
But Paul thought not good to take him with them ; who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the worke .
And the contention was so sharpe betweene them , that they departed asunder one from the other : & so Barnabas tooke Marke , & sailed vnto Cyprus .
And Paul chose Silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren vnto the grace of God .
<NON-VERSE>
Then came he to Derbe , and Lystra : and behold , a certaine disciple was there , named Timotheus , the son of a certaine woman which was a Iewesse , and beleeued : but his father was a Greeke :
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium .
Him would Paul haue to go forth with him , and tooke , and circumcised him , because of the Iewes which were in those quarters : for they knew all , that his father was a Greeke .
And as they went through the cities , they deliuered them the decrees for to keepe , that were ordeined of the Apostles and Elders , which were at Hierusalem .
And so were the Churches established in the faith , and increased in number dayly .
Now when they had gone thorowout Phrygia , and the region of Galatia , and were forbidden of the holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
After they were come to Mysia , they assayed to goe into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
And they passing by Mysia , came downe to Troas .
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night : There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come ouer into Macedonia , and helpe vs .
And after he had seene the vision , immediatly we endeuoured to goe into Macedonia , assuredly gathering , that the Lord had called vs for to preach the Gospel vnto them .
Therfore loosing from Troas , we came with a straight course to Samothracia , and the next day to Neapolis :
And from thence to Philippi , which is the chiefe citie of that part of Macedonia , and a Colonie : and we were in that citie abiding certaine dayes .
And on the Sabboth we went out of the citie by a riuer side , where prayer was wont to be made , & we sate downe , and spake vnto the women which resorted thither .
¶ And a certaine woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the citie of Thyatira , which worshipped God , heard vs : whose heart the Lord opened , that she attended vnto the things which were spoken of Paul .
And when she was baptized , and her houshold , she besought vs , saying , If ye haue iudged me to bee faithfull to the Lord , come into my house , and abide there . And she constrained vs .
¶ And it came to passe , as we went to prayer , a certaine Damosell possessed with a spirit of diuination , met vs : which brought her masters much gaine by soothsaying .
The same followed Paul and vs , and cried , saying , These men are the seruants of the most hie God , which shew vnto vs the way of saluation .
And this did she many dayes : but Paul being grieued , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the Name of Iesus Christ , to come out of her . And he came out the same houre .
¶ And when her Masters saw that the hope of their gaines was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the market place , vnto the rulers ,
And brought them to the Magistrates , saying , These men being Iewes , do exceedingly trouble our city ,
And teach customes which are not lawfull for vs to receiue , neither to obserue , being Romanes .
And the multitude rose vp together against them , and the Magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beate them .
And when they had layed many stripes vpon them , they cast them into prison , charging the Iaylour to keepe them safely .
Who hauing receiued such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , & made their feet fast in the stockes .
¶ And at midnight , Paul and Silas prayed , and sang praises vnto God : and the prisoners heard them .
And suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doores were opened , and euery ones bands were loosed .
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleepe , and seeing the prison doores open , he drew out his sword , and would haue killed himselfe , supposing that the prisoners had beene fled .
But Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Doe thy selfe no harme , for we are all heere .
Then hee called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell downe before Paul and Silas ,
And brought them out , and said , Sirs , what must I doe to be saued ?
And they saide , Beleeue on the Lord Iesus Christ , and thou shalt be saued , and thy house .
And they spake vnto him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
And hee tooke them the same houre of the night , and washed their stripes , and was baptized , hee and all his , straightway .
And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul , The Magistrates haue sent to let you goe : Now therefore depart , and goe in peace .
But Paul said vnto them , They haue beaten vs openly vncondemned , being Romanes , and haue cast vs into prison , and now doe they thrust vs out priuily ? Nay verily , but let them come themselues , and fetch vs out .
And the Sergeants tolde these words vnto the Magistrates : and they feared when they heard that they were Romanes .
And they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the citie .
<NON-VERSE>
Now when they had passed thorow Amphipolis , and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Iewes .
And Paul , as his maner was , went in vnto them , and three Sabbath dayes reasoned with them out of the Scriptures ,
Opening and alleadging , that Christ must needs haue suffered and risen againe from the dead : and that this Iesus whom I preach vnto you , is Christ .
And some of them beleeued , and consorted with Paul and Silas : and of the deuout Greekes a great multitude , and of the chiefe women not a few .
¶ But the Iewes which beleeued not , mooued with enuie , tooke vnto them certaine lewd fellowes of the baser sort , and gathered a company , and set all the citie on an vprore , and assaulted the house of Iason , and sought to bring them out to the people .
And when they found them not , they drew Iason , and certaine brethren vnto the rulers of the citie , crying , These that haue turned the world vpside downe , are come hither also ,
Whom Iason hath receiued : and these all doe contrary to the decrees of Cesar , saying , that there is another King , one Iesus .
¶ And the brethren immediatly sent away Paul and Silas by night vnto Berea : who comming thither , went into the Synagogue of the Iewes .
These were more noble then those in Thessalonica , in that they receiued the word with all readinesse of minde , and searched the Scriptures dayly , whether those things were so .
Therefore many of them beleeued : also of honourable women which were Greekes , and of men not a few .
But when the Iewes of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred vp the people .
And then immediatly the brethren sent away Paul , to goe as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
And they that conducted Paul , brought him vnto Athens , and receiuing a commaundement vnto Silas and Timotheus , for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
¶ Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when hee saw the city wholy giuen to idolatrie .
Therefore disputed he in the Synagogue with the Iewes , and with the deuout persons , and in the market dayly with them that met with him .
Then certaine Philosophers of the Epicureans , and of the Stoikes , encountred him : and some said , What will this babbler say ? Othersome , He seemeth to be a setter foorth of strange gods : because hee preached vnto them Iesus , and the resurrection .
And they tooke him , and brought him vnto Areopagus , saying , May we know what this new doctrine , whereof thou speakest , is ?
For thou bringest certaine strange things to our eares : we would know therefore what these things meane .
( For all the Athenians and strangers which were there , spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to heare some new thing . )
¶ Then Paul stood in the mids of Mars - hill , and said , Yee men of Athens , I perceiue that in all things yee are too superstitious .
For as I passed by , and beheld your deuotions , I found an Altar with this inscription , TO THE VNKNOWEN GOD . Whom therefore yee ignorantly worship , him declare I vnto you .
God that made the world , and all things therein , seeing that hee is Lord of heauen and earth , dwelleth not in Temples made with hands :
Neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing , seeing hee giueth to all , life and breath , and all things ,
And hath made of one blood all nations of men , for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation :
That they should seeke the Lord , if haply they might feele after him and finde him , though he be not farre from euery one of vs .
For in him we liue , and mooue , and haue our being , as certaine also of your owne Poets haue said , For we are also his offspring .
Forasmuch then as wee are the offspring of God , wee ought not to thinke that the Godhead is like vnto golde , or siluer , or stone grauen by arte , and mans deuice .
And the times of this ignorance God winked at , but now commandeth all men euery where to repent :
Because hee hath appointed a day in the which he will iudge the world in righteousnesse , by that man whom hee hath ordeined , whereof he hath giuen assurance vnto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
¶ And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked : and others said , Wee will heare thee againe of this matter .
So Paul departed from among them .
<NON-VERSE>
After these things , Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth ,
And found a certaine Iewe named Aquila , borne in Pontus , lately come from Italy , with his wife Priscilla , ( because that Claudius had commanded all Iewes to depart from Rome ) and came vnto them .
And because hee was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought ( for by their occupation they were tentmakers . )
And hee reasoned in the Synagogue euery Sabbath , and perswaded the Iewes , and the Greekes .
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia , Paul was pressed in spirit , and testified to the Iewes , that Iesus was Christ .
And when they opposed themselues , and blasphemed , he shooke his raiment , and said vnto them , Your blood be vpon your owne heads , I am cleane : from henceforth I will goe vnto the Gentiles .
¶ And hee departed thence , and entred into a certaine mans house , named Iustus , one that worshipped God , whose house ioyned hard to the Synagogue .
And Crispus , the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue , beleeued on the Lord , with all his house : and many of the Corinthians , hearing , beleeued , and were baptized .
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision , Be not afraid , but speake , and holde not thy peace :
For I am with thee , and no man shal set on thee , to hurt thee : for I haue much people in this city .
And hee continued there a yeere and sixe monethes , teaching the word of God among them .
¶ And when Gallio was the Deputie of Achaia , the Iewes made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the iudgement seat ,
Saying , This fellow perswadeth men to worship God contrary to the Law .
And when Paul was now about to open his mouth , Gallio said vnto the Iewes , If it were a matter of wrong , or wicked lewdnesse , O yee Iewes , reason would that I should beare with you .
But if it be a question of words , and names , and of your law , looke ye to it : for I wil be no iudge of such matters .
And he draue them from the iudgment seate .
Then all the Greekes tooke Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue , and beat him before the Iudgement seat : and Gallio cared for none of those things .
¶ And Paul after this taried there yet a good while , and then tooke his leaue of the brethren , and sailed thence into Syria , and with him Priscilla and Aquila : hauing shorne his head in Cenchrea : for he had a vow .
And he came to Ephesus , and left them there : but he himselfe entred into the Synagogue , and reasoned with the Iewes .
When they desired him to tary longer time with them , hee consented not :
But bade them farewell , saying , I must by all meanes keepe this feast that commeth , in Hierusalem ; but I will returne againe vnto you , if God will : and he sailed from Ephesus .
And when he had landed at Cesarea , and gone vp , and saluted the Church , he went downe to Antioch .
And after he had spent some time there , hee departed , and went ouer all the countrey of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
¶ And a certaine Iew , named Apollos , borne at Alexandria , an eloquent man , and mightie in the Scriptures , came to Ephesus .
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord , and being feruent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing onely the baptisme of Iohn .
And he began to speake boldly in the Synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they tooke him vnto them , and expounded vnto him the way of God more perfectly .
And when hee was disposed to passe into Achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receiue him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had beleeued throgh grace .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , that while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul hauing passed thorow the vpper coasts , came to Ephesus , and finding certaine disciples ,
He said vnto them , Haue ye receiued the holy Ghost since yee beleeued ? And they saide vnto him , Wee haue not so much as heard whether there be any holy Ghost .
And he said vnto them , Unto what then were ye baptized ? And they saide , Unto Iohns Baptisme .
Then saide Paul , Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance , saying vnto the people , that they should beleeue on him which should come after him , that is , on Christ Iesus .
When they heard this , they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus .
And when Paul had laide his hands vpon them , the holy Ghost came on them , and they spake with tongues , and prophecied .
And all the men were about twelue .
And hee went into the Synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three moneths , disputing and perswading the things concerning the Kingdome of God .
But when diuers were hardened , and beleeued not , but spake euill of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the schoole of one Tyrannus .
And this continued by the space of two yeeres , so that all they which dwelt in Asia , heard the word of the Lord Iesus , both Iewes and Greeks .
And God wrought speciall miracles by the hands of Paul :
So that from his body were brought vnto the sicke handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the euill spirits went out of them .
¶ Then certaine of the vagabond Iewes , exorcistes , tooke vpon them to call ouer them which had euill spirits , the Name of the Lord Iesus , saying , We adiure you by Iesus whom Paul preacheth .
And there were seuen sonnes of one Sceua a Iewe , and chiefe of the Priests , which did so .
And the euill spirit answered , and said , Iesus I knowe , and Paul I know , but who are ye ?
And the man in whom the euill spirit was , leapt on them , and ouercame them , and preuailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Greekes also dwelling at Ephesus , and feare fell on them all , and the Name of the Lord Iesus was magnified .
And many that beleeued came , and confessed , and shewed their deedes .
Many also of them which vsed curious arts , brought their bookes together and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of siluer .
So mightily grew the word of God , and preuailed .
¶ After these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when hee had passed thorow Macedonia and Athaia , to go to Hierusalem , saying , After I haue bin there , I must also see Rome .
So hee sent into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him , Timotheus and Erastus , but he himselfe stayed in Asia for a season .
And the same time there arose no small stirre about that way .
For a certaine man named Demetrius , a siluer smith , which made siluer shrines for Diana , brought no small gaine vnto the craftsmen :
Whom he called together , with the workemen of like occupation , and said , Sirs , ye know that by this craft we haue our wealth .
Moreouer , ye see & heare , that not alone at Ephesus , but almost throughout all Asia , this Paul hath perswaded and turned away much people , saying , that they bee no gods , which are made with hands .
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought : but also that the Temple of the great goddesse Diana should be despised , and her magnificence should be destroyed , whom all Asia , and the world worshippeth .
And when they heard these sayings , they were ful of wrath , & cried out , saying , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
And the whole citie was filled with confusion , and hauing caught Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia Pauls companions in trauaile , they rushed with one accord into the Theatre .
And when Paul would haue entred in vnto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
And certaine of the chiefe of Asia , which were his friends , sent vnto him , desiring him that he would not aduenture himselfe into the Theatre .
Some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was confused , and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude , the Iewes putting him forward . And Alexander beckened with the hand , and would haue made his defence vnto the people .
But when they knew that he was a Iewe , all with one voyce about the space of two houres cried out , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
And when the towne clarke had appeased the people , he said , Ye men of Ephesus , what man is there that knoweth not how that the citie of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddesse Diana , and of the image which fell downe from Iupiter ?
Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against , ye ought to be quiet , and to doe nothing rashly .
For ye haue brought hither these men , which are neither robbers of Churches , nor yet blasphemers of your goddesse :
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftesmen which are with him , haue a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies , let them implead one another .
But if yee enquire any thing concerning other matters , it shalbe determined in a lawfull assembly . For we are in danger to be called in question for this dayes vprore , there being no cause whereby we may giue an accompt of this concourse .
<NON-VERSE>
And after the vprore was ceased , Paul called vnto him the disciples , and imbraced them , & departed , for to go into Macedonia .
And when he had gone ouer those parts , and had giuen them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
And there abode three moneths : and when the Iewes layed waite for him , as hee was about to saile into Syria , hee purposed to returne thorow Macedonia .
And there accompanied him into Asia , Sopater of Berea : and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus , and Secundus , and Gaius of Derbe , and Timotheus : and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus .
These going before , taried for vs at Troas :
And wee sailed away from Philippi , after the dayes of vnleauened bread , and came vnto them to Troas in fiue dayes , where we abode seuen daies .
And vpon the first day of the weeke , when the disciples came together to breake bread , Paul preached vnto them , ready to depart on the morrow , and continued his speach vntill midnight .
And there were many lights in the vpper chamber where they were gathered together .
And there sate in a window a certaine yong man named Eutychus , being fallen into a deepe sleepe , and as Paul was long preaching , hee sunke downe with sleepe , and fel downe from the third loft , and was taken vp dead .
And Paul went downe , and fell on him , and embracing him , saide , Trouble not your selues , for his life is in him .
When hee therefore was come vp againe , & had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , euen till breake of day , so he departed .
And they brought the yong man aliue , and were not a little comforted .
¶ And wee went before to ship , and sailed vnto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had hee appointed , minding himselfe to goe afoote .
And when he met with vs at Assos , wee tooke him in , and came to Mitylene .
And wee sailed thence , and came the next day ouer against Chios , and the next day we arriued at Samos , and taried at Trogyllium : and the next day we came to Miletus .
For Paul had determined to saile by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Hierusalem the day of Pentecost .
¶ And from Miletus hee sent to Ephesus , and called the Elders of the Church .
And when they were come to him , he said vnto them , Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia , after what maner I haue bene with you at all seasons ,
Seruing the Lord with all humilitie of minde , and with many teares , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Iewes :
And how I kept backe nothing that was profitable vnto you , but haue shewed you , and haue taught you publikely , and from house to house ,
Testifying both to the Iewes and also to the Greekes , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Iesus Christ .
And now behold , I goe bound in the spirit vnto Hierusalem , not knowing the things that shal befall me there :
Saue that the holy Ghost witnesseth in euery city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
But none of these things mooue me , neither count I my life deare vnto my self , so that I might finish my course with ioy , & the ministery which I haue receiued of the Lord Iesus , to testifie the Gospel of the grace of God .
And now behold , I know that ye all , among whom I haue gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
For I haue not shunned to declare vnto you all the counsell of God .
¶ Take heed therefore vnto your selues , & to all the flocke , ouer the which the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseers , to feed the Church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
For I know this , that after my departing shall grieuous wolues enter in among you , not sparing the flocke .
Also of your owne selues shal men arise , speaking peruerse things , to draw away disciples after them .
Therefore watch , and remember that by the space of three yeeres , I ceased not to warne euery one night and day with teares .
And now brethren , I commend you to God , and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you vp , and to giue you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified .
I haue coueted no mans siluer , or golde , or apparell .
Yea , you your selues know , that these handes haue ministred vnto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
I haue shewed you all things , how that so labouring , yee ought to support the weake , and to remember the words of the Lord Iesus , how he said , It is more blessed to giue , then to receiue .
¶ And when he had thus spoken , he kneeled downe , & prayed with them all .
And they all wept sore , and fell on Pauls necke , and kissed him ,
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , that after wee were gotten from them , and had lanched , wee came with a straight course vnto Choos , and the day following vnto Rhodes , and from thence vnto Patara .
And finding a ship sailing ouer vnto Phenicea , wee went abroad , and set foorth .
Now when wee had discouered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the shippe was to vnlade her burden .
And finding disciples , wee taried there seuen dayes : who said to Paul through the Spirit , that hee should not goe vp to Hierusalem .
And when we had accomplished those dayes , we departed , and went our way , and they all brought vs on our way , with wiues and children , till wee were out of the citie : and wee kneeled downe on the shore , and prayed .
And when we had taken our leaue one of another , we tooke ship , and they returned home againe .
And when wee had finished our course from Tyre , wee came to Ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
And the next day we that were of Pauls company , departed , and came vnto Cesarea , and wee entred into the house of Philip the Euangelist ( which was one of the seuen ) & abode with him .
And the same man had foure daughters , virgins , which did prophesie .
And as wee taried there many dayes , there came downe from Iudea a certaine Prophet , named Agabus .
And when he was come vnto vs , he tooke Pauls girdle , and bound his owne hands and feete , and said , Thus sayth the holy Ghost , So shall the Iewes at Hierusalem binde the man that oweth this girdle , and shall deliuer him into the hands of the Gentiles .
And when we heard these things , both we and they of that place , besought him not to goe vp to Hierusalem .
Then Paul answered , What meane ye to weepe and to breake mine heart ? for I am ready , not to bee bound onely , but also to die at Hierusalem for the Name of the Lord Iesus .
And when he would not bee perswaded , we ceased , saying , The will of the Lord be done .
And after those dayes we tooke vp our cariages , & went vp to Hierusalem .
There went with vs also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
And when we were come to Hierusalem , the brethren receiued vs gladly
And the day following Paul went in with vs vnto Iames , and all the Elders were present .
And when hee had saluted them , hee declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministerie .
And when they heard it , they glorified the Lord , & said vnto him , Thou seest , brother , how many thousands of Iewes there are which beleeue , and they are all zealous of the Law .
And they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the Iewes which are among the Gentiles , to forsake Moses , saying , that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walke after the customes .
What is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will heare that thou art come .
Doe therefore this that we say to thee : Wee haue foure men which haue a vow on them ,
Then take , and purifie thy selfe with them , & bee at charges with them , that they may shaue their heads : and all may know that those things wherof they were informed concerning thee , are nothing , but that thou thy selfe also walkest orderly , and keepest the Law .
As touching the Gentiles which beleeue , wee haue written and concluded , that they obserue no such thing , saue onely that they keepe themselues from things offered to idoles , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
Then Paul tooke the men , and the next day purifying himselfe with them , entred into the Temple , to signifie the accomplishment of the dayes of purification , vntill that an offering should be offered for euery one of them :
And when the seuen dayes were almost ended , the Iewes which were of Asia , when they saw him in the Temple , stirred vp all the people , and laide hands on him ,
Crying out , Men of Israel , helpe : this is the man that teacheth al men euery where against the people , and the law , and this place : and farther brought Greeks also into the Temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
( For they had seene before with him in the citie , Trophimus an Ephesian , whome they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple . )
And all the citie was moued , and the people ran together : and they tooke Paul , and drew him out of the Temple : and forthwith the doores were shut .
And as they went about to kil him , tidings came vnto the chiefe captaine of the band , that all Hierusalem was in an vprore .
Who immediatly tooke souldiers , and Centurions , and ran downe vnto them : and when they saw the chiefe captaine and the souldiers , they left beating of Paul .
Then the chiefe captain came neere , and tooke him , & commanded him to be bound with two chains , and demanded who he was , and what hee had done .
And some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certaintie for the tumult , he commanded him to be caried into the castle .
And when he came vpon the staires , so it was that he was borne of the souldiers , for the violence of the people .
For the multitude of the people followed after , crying , Away with him .
And as Paul was to bee led into the castle , hee saide vnto the chiefe captaine , May I speake vnto thee ? Who saide , Canst thou speake Greeke ?
Art not thou that Egyptian which before these daies madest an vprore , and leddest out into the wildernesse foure thousand men that were murtherers ?
But Paul said , I am a man which am a Iew of Tarsus , a citie in Cilicia , a citizen of no meane citie : & I beseech thee suffer me to speake vnto the people .
<NON-VERSE>
Men , brethren , and fathers , heare ye my defence which I make now vnto you .
( And when they heard that hee spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
I am verely a man which am a Iew , borne in Tarsus a citie in Cilicia , yet brought vp in this citie at the feete of Gamaliel , and taught according to the perfect maner of the law of the fathers , and was zealous towards God , as ye all are this day .
And I persecuted this way vnto the death , binding and deliuering into prisons both men and women ,
As also the high Priest doth beare me witnesse , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I receiued letters vnto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there , bound vnto Hierusalem , for to be punished .
And it came to passe , that as I made my iourney , & was come nigh vnto Damascus about noone , suddenly there shone from heauen a great light round about me .
And I fell vnto the ground , and heard a voice saying vnto mee , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
And I answered , Who art thou , Lord ? And he said vnto me , I am Iesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest .
And they that were with me saw indeede the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
And I saide , What shall I doe , Lord ? And the Lord said vnto me , Arise , and goe into Damascus , and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to doe .
And when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
And one Ananias , a deuout man according to the law , hauing a good report of al the Iewes which dwelt there ,
Came vnto me , and stood , & said vnto me , Brother Saul , receiue thy sight . And the same houre I looked vp vpon him .
And he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , & see that Iust one , and shouldest heare the voice of his mouth .
For thou shalt be his witnes vnto al men , of what thou hast seene & heard .
And now , why tariest thou ? Arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sinnes , calling on the name of the Lord .
And it came to passe , that when I was come againe to Hierusalem , euen while I prayed in the temple , I was in a trance ,
And saw him saying vnto mee , Make haste , and get thee quickly out of Hierusalem : for they will not receiue thy testimony concerning me .
And I said , Lord , they know that I imprisoned , and beat in euery synagogue them that beleeued on thee .
And when the blood of thy martyr Steuen was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting vnto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
And he said vnto me , Depart : for I will send thee farre hence , vnto the Gentiles .
And they gaue him audience vnto this word , and then lift vp their voices , and said , Away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should liue .
And as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , & threw dust into the aire ,
The chiefe captaine commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that hee should be examined by scourging : that he might know wherfore they cried so against him .
And as they bound him with thongs , Paul said vnto the Centurion that stood by , Is it lawfull for you to scourge a man that is a Romane , and vncondemned ?
When the Centurion heard that , hee went and told the chiefe captaine , saying , Take heede what thou doest , for this man is a Romane .
Then the chiefe captaine came ; and said vnto him , Tell me , art thou a Romane ? He said , Yea .
And the chiefe captaine answered , With a great summe obteined I this freedome . And Paul said , But I was free borne .
Then straightway they departed from him which should haue examined him : and the chiefe captaine also was afraid after he knew that he was a Romane , & because he had bound him .
<NON-VERSE>
And Paul earnestly beholding the council , said , Men and brethren , I haue liued in all good conscience before God vntill this day .
And the high Priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him , to smite him on the mouth .
Then saith Paul vnto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to iudge mee after the Law , and commandest mee to be smitten contrary to the Law ?
And they that stood by , said , Reuilest thou Gods high Priest ?
Then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that hee was the high Prist : For it is written , Thou shalt not speake euill of the ruler of thy people .
But when Paul perceiued that the one part were Sadducees , and the other Pharisees , hee cryed out in the Councill , Men and brethren , I am a Pharisee , the sonne of a Pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead , I am called in question .
And when hee had so said , there arose a dissension betweene the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was diuided .
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither Angel , nor spirit : but the Pharisees confesse both .
And there arose a great cry : and the Scribes that were of the Pharisees part arose , and stroue , saying , Wee finde no euill in this man : but if a spirit or an Angel hath spoken to him , let vs not fight against God .
And when there arose a great dissension , the chiefe captaine fearing lest Paul should haue bene pulled in pieces of them , commanded the souldiers to goe downe , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
And the night folowing , the Lord stood by him , and saide , Bee of good cheere , Paul : for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem , so must thou beare witnesse also at Rome .
And when it was day , certaine of the Iewes banded together , and bound themselues vnder a curse , saying , that they would neither eate nor drinke till they had killed Paul .
And they were more then fourtie which had made this conspiracie .
And they came to the chiefe Priests and Elders , and said , Wee haue bound our selues vnder a great curse , that wee will eate nothing vntill wee haue slaine Paul .
Now therefore ye with the Councill , signifie to the chiefe captaine that he bring him downe vnto you to morrow , as though yee would enquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we , or euer he come neere , are ready to kill him .
And when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying in wait , hee went and entred into the castle , & told Paul .
Then Paul called one of the Centurions vnto him , and said , Bring this yong man vnto the chiefe captaine : for he hath a certaine thing to tell him .
So he took him , and brought him to the chiefe captaine , and said , Paul the prisoner called me vnto him , and praied mee to bring this yong man vnto thee , who hath something to say vnto thee .
Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hand , and went with him aside priuately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
And he said , The Iewes haue agreed to desire thee , that thou wouldest bring downe Paul to morrow into the Council , as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
But do not thou yeeld vnto them : for there lie in wait for him of them moe then fourtie men , which haue bound themselues with an othe , that they will neither eate nor drinke , till they haue killed him : and now are they ready , looking for a promise from thee .
So the chiefe captaine then let the yong man depart , and charged him , See thou tell no man , that thou hast shewed these things to me .
And he called vnto him two Centurions , saying , Make ready two hundred souldiers to goe to Cesarea , and horsemen threescore and ten , and spearemen two hundred , at the third houre of the night .
And prouide them beasts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe vnto Felix the gouernour .
And hee wrote a letter after this manner :
Claudius Lysias , vnto the most excellent Gouernour Felix , sendeth greeting .
This man was taken of the Iewes and should haue beene killed of them : Then came I with an armie , and rescued him , hauing vnderstood that he was a Romane .
And when I would haue knowen the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him foorth into their Council .
Whom I perceiued to be accused of questions of their lawe , but to haue nothing laide to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
And when it was tolde me , how that the Iewes laid waite for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gaue commandement to his accusers also , to say before thee what they had against him . Farewell .
Then the souldiers , as it was commaunded them , tooke Paul , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
On the morow , they left the horsemen to goe with him , and returned to the castle .
Who when they came to Cesarea , and deliuered the Epistle to the gouernour , presented Paul also before him .
And when the gouernour had read the letter , he asked of what prouince he was . And when he vnderstood that he was of Cilicia :
<NON-VERSE>
And after fiue dayes , Ananias the hie Priest descended with the Elders , and with a certaine Oratour named Tertullus , who enformed the gouernour against Paul .
And when he was called foorth , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , Seeing that by thee we enioy great quietnesse , and that very worthy deeds are done vnto this nation by thy prouidence :
Wee accept it alwayes , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thankfulnesse .
Notwithstanding , that I be not farther tedious vnto thee , I pray thee , that thou wouldest heare vs of thy clemencie a few words .
For we haue found this man a pestilent fellow , and a moouer of sedition among all the Iewes throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
And the Iewes also assented , saying that these things were so .
Then Paul , after that the gouernour had beckened vnto him to speake , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many yeeres a Iudge vnto this nation , I do the more cheerefully answere for my selfe :
Because that thou mayest vnderstand , that there are yet but twelue dayes , since I went vp to Hierusalem for to worship .
And they neither found me in the Temple disputing with any man , neither raising vp the people , neither in the Synagogues , nor in the citie :
Neither can they proue the things whereof they now accuse me .
But this I confesse vnto thee , that after the way which they call heresie , so worship I the God of my fathers , beleeuing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets ,
And haue hope towards God , which they themselues also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the iust and vniust .
And herein doe I exercise my selfe to haue alwayes a conscience void of offence toward God , and toward men .
Now after many yeeres , I came to bring almes to my nation , & offrings :
Wherupon certaine Iewes from Asia found me purified in the Temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult :
Except it be for this one voice , that I cried standing among them , Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day .
And when Felix heard these things , hauing more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them and said , When Lysias the chiefe captaine shall come downe , I will know the vttermost of your matter .
And he commanded a Centurion to keepe Paul , and to let him haue libertie , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister , or come vnto him .
He hoped also that money should haue bene giuen him of Paul , that hee might loose him : wherefore hee sent for him the oftner , and communed with him .

Nowe when Festus was come into the prouince , after three dayes he ascended from Cesarea to Hierusalem .
Then the high Priest , and the chiefe of the Iewes informed him against Paul , and besought him ,
And desired fauour against him , that he would send for him to Hierusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
But Festus answered , that Paul should be kept at Cesarea , and that hee himselfe would depart shortly thither .
Let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go downe with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickednesse in him .
And when hee had taried among them more then ten dayes , hee went downe vnto Cesarea , and the next day sitting in the iudgement seat , commanded Paul to be brought .
And when hee was come , the Iewes which came downe from Hierusalem , stood round about , and laide many and grieuous complaints against Paul , which they could not proue ,
While hee answered for himselfe , Neither against the law of the Iewes , neither against the Temple , nor yet against Cesar , haue I offended any thing at all .
But Festus willing to doe the Iewes a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou goe vp to Hierusalem , and there be iudged of these things before me ?
Then said Paul , I stand at Cesars iudgement seat , where I ought to bee iudged ; to the Iewes haue I done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
For if I be an offender , or haue committed any thing worthy of death , I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliuer me vnto them . I appeale vnto Cesar .
Then Festus when he had conferred with the Councill , answered , Hast thou appealed vnto Cesar ? vnto Cesar shalt thou goe .
And after certaine dayes , king Agrippa and Bernice , came vnto Cesarea , to salute Festus .
And when they had beene there many dayes , Festus declared Pauls cause vnto the king , saying , There is a certaine man left in bonds by Felix :
About whom when I was at Hierusalem , the chiefe Priests and the Elders of the Iewes enformed me , desiring to haue iudgement against him .
To whom I answered , It is not the maner of the Romanes to deliuer any man to die , before that he which is accused , haue the accusers face to face , and haue licence to answere for himselfe concerning the crime laid against him .
Therefore when they were come hither , without any delay , on the morrow I sate on the iudgement seate , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
Against whom when the accusers stood vp , they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed :
But had certaine questions against him of their owne superstition , and of one Iesus , which was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be aliue .
And because I doubted of such maner of questions , I asked him whether he would goe to Hierusalem , and there be iudged of these matters .
But when Paul had appealed to bee reserued vnto the hearing of Augustus , I commanded him to be kept , till I might send him to Cesar .
Then Agrippa said vnto Festus , I would also heare the man my selfe . To morrow , said he , thou shalt heare him .
And on the morrow when Agrippa was come and Bernice , with great pompe , and was entred into the place of hearing , with the chiefe captaines , and principall men of the citie ; at Festus commaundement Paul was brought foorth .
And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are heere present with vs , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue dealt with me , both at Hierusalem , and also heere , crying that he ought not to liue any longer .
But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himselfe hath appealed to Augustus , I haue determined to send him .
Of whom I haue no certaine thing to write vnto my Lord : Wherefore I haue brought him foorth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that after examination had , I might haue somewhat to write .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Agrippa said vnto Paul , Thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe . Then Paul stretched foorth the hand , and answered for himselfe ,
I thinke my selfe happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answere for my selfe this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Iewes :
Especially , because I know thee to be expert in all customes and questions which are among the Iewes : wherefore I beseech thee to heare mee patiently .
My maner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine owne nation at Hierusalem , know all the Iewes ,
Which knew me from the beginning , ( if they would testifie ) that after the most straitest sect of our religion , I liued a Pharisee .
And now I stand , and am iudged for the hope of the promise made of God vnto our fathers :
Vnto which promise our twelue tribes instantly seruing God day and night , hope to come : For which hopes sake , King Agrippa , I am accused of the Iewes .
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
I verily thought with my selfe , that I ought to doe many things contrary to the name of Iesus of Nazareth :
Which thing I also did in Hierusalem , and many of the Saints did I shut vp in prison , hauing receiued authoritie from the chiefe Priests , and when they were put to death , I gaue my voyce against them .
And I punished them oft in euery Synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme , and being exceedingly mad against them , I persecuted them euen vnto strange cities .
Whereupon , as I went to Damascus , with authoritie and commission from the chiefe Priests :
At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heauen , aboue the brightnes of the Sunne , shining round about mee , and them which iourneyed with me .
And when wee were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking vnto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? It is hard for thee to kicke against the prickes .
And I said , Who art thou , Lord ? And hee said , I am Iesus whom thou persecutest .
But rise , and stand vpon thy feete , for I haue appeared vnto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witnesse , both of these things which thou hast seene , & of those things in the which I will appeare vnto thee ,
Deliuering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , vnto whom now I send thee ,
To open their eyes , and to turne them from darknesse to light , and from the power of Satan vnto God , that they may receiue forgiuenesse of sinnes , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .
Whereupon , O king Agrippa , I was not disobedient vnto the heauenly vision :
But shewed first vnto them of Damascus , and at Hierusalem , and thorowout all the coasts of Iudea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turne to God , and do works meete for repentance .
For these causes the Iewes caught mee in the Temple , and went about to kill me .
Hauing therefore obteined helpe of God , I continue vnto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come :
That Christ should suffer , and that hee should be the first that should rise from the dead , & should shew light vnto the people , and to the Gentiles .
And as hee thus spake for himselfe , Festus saide with a lowd voyce , Paul , thou art beside thy selfe , much learning doeth make thee mad .
But he said , I am not mad , most noble Festus , but speake foorth the words of trueth and sobernesse .
For the King knoweth of these things , before whom also I speake freely : for I am perswaded , that none of these things are hidden from him , for this thing was not done in a corner .
King Agrippa , beleeuest thou the Prophets ? I know that thou beleeuest .
Then Agrippa saide vnto Paul , Almost thou perswadest mee to bee a Christian .
And Paul said , I would to God , that not onely thou , but also all that heare mee this day , were both almost , and altogether such as I am , except these bonds .
And when hee had thus spoken , the king rose vp , and the gouernour , and Bernice , & they that sate with them .
And when they were gone aside , they talked betweene themselues , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death , or of bonds .

And when it was determined , that wee should saile into Italy , they deliuered Paul , & certaine other prisoners , vnto one named Iulius , a centurion of Augustus band .
And entring into a ship of Adramyttium , wee lanched , meaning to saile by the coasts of Asia , one Aristarchus a Macedonian , of Thessalonica , beeing with vs .
And the next day wee touched at Sidon : And Iulius courteously entreated Paul , and gaue him libertie to goe vnto his friends to refresh himselfe .
And when we had lanched from thence , we sailed vnder Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
And when we had sailed ouer the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , wee came to Myra a citie of Lysia .
And there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy , and he put vs therein .
And when wee had sailed slowly many dayes , and scarse were come ouer against Gnidus , the wind not suffering vs , wee sailed vnder Creete , ouer against Salmone ,
And hardly passing it , came vnto a place which is called the Faire hauens , nigh whereunto was the citie of Lasea .
Now when much time was spent , and when sailing was now dangerous , because the Fast was now alreadie past , Paul admonished them ,
And said vnto them , Sirs , I perceiue that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage , not onely of the lading & ship , but also of our liues .
Neuerthelesse , the Centurion beleeued the master and the owner of the shippe , more then those things which were spoken by Paul .
And because the hauen was not commodious to winter in , the more part aduised to depart thence also , if by any meanes they might attaine to Phenice , and there to winter ; which is an hauen of Creete , and lieth toward the Southwest , and Northwest .
And when the South wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , loosing thence , they sailed close by Creete .
But not long after , there arose against it a tempestuous winde , called Euroclydon .
And when the ship was caught , and could not beare vp into the winde , we let her driue .
And running vnder a certaine yland , which is called Clauda , wee had much worke to come by the boate :
Which when they had taken vp , they vsed helps , vnder - girding the ship ; and fearing lest they should fall into the quicke - sands , strake saile , and so were driuen .
And being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day , they lightened the ship :
And the third day we cast out with our owne handes the tackling of the shippe .
And when neither Sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared , and no small tempest lay on vs ; all hope that wee should be saued , was then taken away .
But after long abstinence , Paul stood foorth in the middes of them , and said , Sirs , yee should haue hearkened vnto mee , and not haue loosed from Creete , and to haue gained this harme and losse .
And now I exhort you to be of good cheere : for there shall be no losse of any mans life among you , but of the shippe .
For there stood by me this night the Angel of God , whose I am , and whom I serue ,
Saying , Feare not Paul , thou must be brought before Cesar , and loe , God hath giuen thee all them that saile with thee .
Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheere : for I beleeue God , that it shall be euen as it was tolde me .
Howbeit , we must be cast vpon a certaine Iland .
But when the fourteenth night was come , as wee were driuen vp and downe in Adria about midnight , the shipmen deemed that they drew neere to some countrey :
And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let downe the boat into the sea , vnder colour as though they would haue cast ancres out of the fore - ship ,
Paul said to the Centurion , and to the souldiers , Except these abide in the ship , ye cannot be saued .
Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
And while the day was comming on , Paul besought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the fourteenth day that ye haue taried , and continued fasting , hauing taken nothing .
Wherefore , I pray you to take some meat , for this is for your health : for there shall not an haire fall from the head of any of you .
And when hee had thus spoken , hee tooke bread , and gaue thankes to God in presence of them all , and when he had broken it , he began to eate .
Then were they all of good cheere , and they also tooke some meat .
And we were in all , in the ship , two hundred , threescore and sixteene soules .
And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
And when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discouered a certaine creek , with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
And when they had taken vp the ankers , they committed themselues vnto the sea , & loosed the rudder bands , and hoised vp the maine saile to the winde , and made toward shore .
And falling into a place where two seas met , they ranne the shippe a ground , and the forepart stucke fast , and remained vnmoueable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waues .
And the souldiers counsel was to kil the prisoners , lest any of them should swimme out , and escape .
But the Centurion , willing to saue Paul , kept them from their purpose , and commanded that they which could swimme , should cast themselues first into the sea , and get to land : <NON-VERSE>
And when they were escaped , then they knew that the Iland was called Melita .
And the barbarous people shewed vs no little kindnesse : for they kindled a fire , and receiued vs euery one because of the present raine , and because of the cold .
And when Paul had gathered a bundle of stickes , and layde them on the fire , there came a Uiper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
And when the Barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they saide among themselues , No doubt this man is a murtherer , whom though hee hath escaped the Sea , yet Uengeance suffereth not to liue .
And hee shooke off the beast into the fire , and felt no harme .
Howbeit , they looked when hee should haue swollen , or fallen downe dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while , and saw no harme come to him , they changed their minds , and said that he was a God .
In the same quarters were possessions of the chiefe man of the Iland , whose name was Publius , who receiued vs , and lodged vs three dayes courteously .
And it came to passe that the father of Publius lay sicke of a feuer , and of a bloody - flixe , to whom Paul entred in , and prayed , and layed his hands on him , and healed him .
So when this was done , others also which had diseases in the Iland , came , and were healed :
Who also honoured vs with many honours , and when wee departed , they laded vs with such things as were necessary .
And after three moneths wee departed in a ship of Alexandria , which had wintered in the Ile , whose signe was Castor and Pollux .
And landing at Syracuse wee taried there three dayes .
And from thence wee fet a compasse , and came to Rhegium , and after one day the South winde blew , and we came the next day to Puteoli :
Where wee found brethren , and were desired to tary with them seuen dayes : and so we went toward Rome .
And it came to passe , that after three dayes , Paul called the chiefe of the Iewes together . And when they were come together , he said vnto them , Men and brethren , though I haue committed nothing against the people , or customes of our fathers , yet was I deliuered prisoner from Hierusalem into the hands of the Romanes .
Who when they had examined me , would haue let me goe , because there was no cause of death in me .
But when the Iewes spake against it , I was constrained to appeale vnto Cesar , not that I had ought to accuse my nation of .
For this cause therefore haue I called for you , to see you , and to speake with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chaine .
And they saide vnto him , Wee neither receiued letters out of Iudea concerning thee , neither any of the brethren that came , shewed or spake any harme of thee .
But we desire to heare of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , we know that euery where it is spoken against .
And when they had appointed him a day , there came many to him into his lodging , to whom he expounded and testified the kingdome of God , perswading them concerning Iesus , both out of the law of Moses , and out of the Prophets , from morning till euening .
And some beleeued the things which were spoken , and some beleeued not .
And when they agreed not among themselues , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well spake the holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet , vnto our fathers ,
Saying , Goe vnto this people , and say , Hearing ye shall heare , and shall not vnderstand , and seeing ye shall see , and not perceiue .
For the heart of this people is waxed grosse , and their eares are dull of hearing , and their eyes haue they closed , lest they should with their eyes , and heare with their eares , and vnderstand with their heart , and should bee conuerted , and I should heale them .
Be it knowen therfore vnto you , that the saluation of God is sent vnto the Gentiles , and that they wil heare it . And when hee had saide these words , the Iewes departed , and had great reasoning among themselues .
And Paul dwelt two whole yeeres in his owne hired house , and receiued all that came in vnto him ,

For thus saith the Lord God , The citie that went out by a thousand , shall leaue an hundred , and that which went foorth by an hundred , shall leaue ten to the house of Israel .
¶ For thus saith the Lord vnto the house of Israel , Seeke ye mee , and ye shall liue .
But seeke not Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal and passe not to Beer - sheba : for Gilgal shall surely goe into captiuitie , and Bethel shal come to nought .
Seeke the Lord , and ye shall liue , lest hee breake out like fire in the house of Ioseph and deuoure it , and there be none to quench it in Bethel ,
Ye who turne iudgment to wormwood , and leaue off righteousnesse in the earth :
Seeke him that maketh the seuen starres and Orion , and turneth the shadow of death into the morning , and maketh the day darke with night : that calleth for the waters of the Sea , and powreth them out vpon the face of the earth : the Lord is his Name .
That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong : so that the spoiled shall come against the fortresse .
They hate him that rebuketh in the gate : and they abhorre him that speaketh vprightly .
Forasmuch therfore as your treading is vpon the poore , and ye take from him burdens of wheate , ye haue built houses of hewen stone , but ye shall not dwell in them : yee haue planted pleasant vineyards , but ye shall not drinke wine of them .
For I know your manifold transgressions , and your mighty sinnes : they afflict the iust , they take a bribe , and they turne aside the poore in the gate from their right .
Therefore the prudent shall keepe silence in that time , for it is an euill time .
Seeke good and not euill , that ye may liue : and so the Lord , the God of hosts shall be with you , as yee haue spoken .
Hate the euill , and loue the good , and establish iudgement in the gate : it may be that the Lord God of hostes will bee gracious vnto the remnant of Ioseph .
Therefore the Lord , the God of hostes , the Lord saith thus : Wailing shall be in all streets , and they shall say in all the high wayes , Alas , Alas : and they shall call the husbandman to mourning , and such as are skilful of lamentation , to wailing .
And in all vineyards shall be wailing : for I will passe through thee , saith the Lord .
Woe vnto you that desire the day of the Lord : to what ende is it for you ? the day of the Lord is darknes and not light .
As if a man did flee from a lyon , and a beare met him , or went into the house , and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
Shall not the day of the Lord be darkenes , and not light ? euen very darke , and no brightnesse in it ?
¶ I hate , I despise your feast dayes , and I will not smell in your solemne assemblies .
Though ye offer me burnt offerings , and your meat offerings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
Take thou away from mee the noise of thy songs : for I will not heare the melodie of thy violes .
But let iudgement run downe as waters , and righteousnesse as a mightie streame .
Haue yee offered vnto mee sacrifices and offerings in the wildernesse fourtie yeeres , O house of Israel ?
But yee haue borne the tabernacle of your Moloch , and Chiun your images , the starre of your god , which ye made to your selues .

That lie vpon beds of Yuorie , and stretch themselues vpon their couches , and eate the lambes out of the flocke , and the calues out of the midst of the stall :
That chaunt to the sound of the Uiole , and inuent to themselues instruments of musicke , like Dauid :
That drinke wine in bowles , and anoint themselues with the chiefe ointments : but they are not grieued for the affliction of Ioseph .

Then shall he say , Holde thy tongue : for wee may not make mention of the Name of the Lord .
For beholde , the Lord commandeth , and hee will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
¶ Shall horses runne vpon the rocke ? wil one plow there with oxen ? for ye haue turned iudgement into gall , and the fruite of righteousnesse into hemlocke .

Thus hath the Lord God shewed vnto me , and behold , he formed grassehoppers in the beginning of the shooting vp of the latter grouth : and loe , it was the latter grouth after the kings mowings .

And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate , and the Sanctuaries of Israel shalbe laide waste : and I will rise against the house of Ieroboam with the sword .
¶ Then Amaziah the Priest of Beth - el sent to Ieroboam king of Israel , saying ; Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to beare all his words .
For thus Amos saith , Ieroboam shall die by the sword , and Israel shall surely be led away captiue , out of their owne land .
Also Amaziah said vnto Amos , O thou Seer , goe , flee thee away into the land of Iudah , and there eate bread , and prophecie there .
But prophecie not againe any more at Beth - el : for it is the Kings Chappell , and it is the Kings Court .
¶ Then answered Amos , and sayde to Amaziah ; I was no Prophet , neither was I a Prophets sonne , but I was an heardman , and a gatherer of Sycomore fruit .
And the Lord tooke me as I followed the flocke , and the Lord said vnto me , Goe , prophecie vnto my people Israel .

That wee may buy the poore for siluer , & the needie for a paire of shoes ; yea , and sell the refuse of the wheate ?
The Lord hath sworne by the excellencie of Iacob , Surely I will neuer forget any of their workes .
Shall not the land tremble for this , and euery one mourne that dwelleth therein ? and it shall rise vp wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
And it shall come to passe in that day , saith the Lord God , that I will cause the Sunne to go downe at noone , and I will darken the earth in the cleare day .
And I will turne your feasts into mourning , and all your songs into lamentation , and I will bring vp sackcloth vpon all loynes , and baldnesse vpon euery head : and I will make it as the mourning of an onely sonne , and the end thereof as a bitter day .

Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ , by the will of God , and Timotheus our brother ,
To the saints and faithfull brethren in Christ , which are at Colosse , grace be vnto you , and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Iesus Christ .
We giue thanks to God , and the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ , praying alwayes for you ,
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Iesus , and of the loue which yee haue to all the Saints ,
For the hope which is layd vp for you in heauen , whereof ye heard before in the word of the trueth of the Gospel ,
Which is come vnto you as it is in all the world , and bringeth foorth fruit , as it doth also in you , since the day yee heard of it , and knew the grace of God in trueth ,
As yee also learned of Epaphras our deare felow seruant , who is for you a faithfull Minister of Christ :
Who also declared vnto vs your loue in the spirit .
For this cause wee also , since the day we heard it , doe not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will , in all wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding :
That ye might walke worthy of the Lord vnto all pleasing , being fruitfull in euery good worke , & increasing in the knowledge of God :
Strengthened with all might according to his glorious power , vnto all patience and long suffering with ioyfulnesse :
Giuing thanks vnto the Father , which hath made vs meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light :
Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkenesse , and hath translated vs into the kingdome of his deare Sonne ,
In whom we haue redemption through his blood , euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes :
Who is the image of the inuisible God , the first borne of euery creature .
For by him were all things created that are in heauen , and that are in earth , visible and inuisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him .
And he is before all things , and by him all things consist .
And hee is the head of the body , the Church : who is the beginning , the first borne from the dead , that in all things he might haue the preeminence :
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulnesse dwell ,
And ( hauing made peace through the blood of his crosse ) by him to reconcile all things vnto himself , by him , I say , whether they bee things in earth , or things in heauen .
And you that were sometimes alienated , and enemies in your minde by wicked workes , yet now hath hee reconciled ,
In the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy & vnblameable , and vnreprooueable in his sight ,
If ye continue in the faith grounded and setled , and be not moued away from the hope of the Gospel , which yee haue heard , and which was preached to euery creature which is vnder heauen , whereof I Paul am made a Minister .
Who now reioyce in my sufferings for you , and fill vp that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh , for his bodies sake , which is the Church ,
Whereof I am made a Minister , according to the dispensation of God , which is giuen to mee for you , to fulfill the word of God :
Euen the mystery which hath been hid from ages , and from generations , but now is made manifest to his saints ,
To whom God would make knowen what is the riches of the glory of this mysterie among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
Whom we preach , warning euery man , and teaching euery man in all wisedome , that we may present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus .

For I would that ye knew what great conflict I haue for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as haue not seene my face in the flesh :
That their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in loue , and vnto all riches of the full assurance of vnderstanding , to the acknowledgement of the mysterie of God , and of the Father , and of Christ ,
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisedome , and knowledge .
And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with entising words .
For though I bee absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , ioying and beholding your order , and the stedfastnesse of your faith in Christ .
As yee haue therefore receiued Christ Iesus the Lord , so walke yee in him :
Rooted and built vp in him , and stablished in the faith , as yee haue bene taught , abounding therein with thankesgiuing .
Beware lest any man spoile you through Philosophie and vaine deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ :
For in him dwelleth all the fulnesse of the Godhead bodily .
And ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principalitie , & power .
In whom also ye are circumcised with the Circumcision made without handes , in putting off the body of the sinnes of the flesh , by the Circumcision of Christ :
Buried with him in Baptisme , wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
And you being dead in your sinnes , and the vncircumcision of your flesh , hath hee quickened together with him , hauing forgiuen you all trespasses ,
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances , that was against vs , which was contrary to vs , and tooke it out of the way , nayling it to his Crosse :
And hauing spoyled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing ouer them in it .
Let no man therefore iudge you in meat , or in drinke , or in respect of an Holy day , or of the New moone , or of the Sabbath dayes :
Which are a shadow of things to come , but the body is of Christ .
Let no man beguile you of your reward , in a voluntary humilitie , and worshipping of Angels , intruding into those things which hee hath not seene , vainely puft vp by his fleshly minde :
And not holding the head , from which all the body by ioynts and bands hauing nourishment ministred , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God .
Wherefore if yee bee dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world : why , as though liuing in the world , are ye subiect to ordinances ?
( Touch not , taste not , handle not :
Which all are to perish with the vsing ) after the commandements and doctrines of men :
<NON-VERSE>
If yee then bee risen with Christ , seeke those things which are aboue , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God :
Set your affection on things aboue , not on things on the earth .
For yee are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
When Christ , who is our life , shall appeare , then shall yee also appeare with him in glorie .
Mortifie therefore your members which are vpon the earth : fornication , vncleannesse , inordinate affection , euill concupiscence , and couetousnesse , which is idolatrie :
For which things sake , the wrath of God commeth on the children of disobedience ,
In the which yee also walked sometime , when ye liued in them .
But now you also put off all these , anger , wrath , malice , blasphemie , filthy communication out of your mouth .
Lie not one to another , seeing that yee haue put off the old man with his deedes :
And haue put on the new man , which is renued in knowledge , after the image of him that created him ,
Where there is neither Greeke , nor Iew , circumcision , nor vncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond , nor free : but Christ is all , and in all .
Put on therefore ( as the elect of God , holy and beloued ) bowels of mercies , kindnesse , humblenesse of minde , meekenesse , long suffering ,
Forbearing one another , and forgiuing one another , if any man haue a quarrell against any : euen as Christ forgaue you , so also doe yee .
And aboue all these things put on charitie , which is the bond of perfectnesse .
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also yee are called in one body : and be yee thankefull .
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdome , teaching and admonishing one another in Psalmes , and Hymnes , and Spirituall songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
And whatsoeuer yee doe in word or deed , doe all in the Name of the Lord Iesus , giuing thankes to God and the Father , by him .
Wiues , submit your selues vnto your owne husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
Husbands , loue your wiues , and be not bitter against them .
Children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well pleasing vnto the Lord .
Fathers , prouoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
Seruants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh : not with eye seruice as men pleasers , but in singlenesse of heart , fearing God :
And whatsoeuer yee doe , doe it heartily , as to the Lord , and not vnto men :
Knowing , that of the Lord yee shall receiue the reward of the inheritance : for ye serue the Lord Christ .

Masters , giue vnto your seruants that which is iust and equall , knowing that yee also haue a Master in heauen .
Continue in prayer , and watch in the same with thankesgiuing :
Withall , praying also for vs , that God would open vnto vs a doore of vtterance , to speake the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
That I may make it manifest , as I ought to speake .
Walke in wisdome toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
Let your speech bee alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how yee ought to answere euery man .
All my state shall Tychicus declare vnto you , who is a beloued brother , and a faithfull minister , and fellow seruant in the Lord :
Whom I haue sent vnto you for the same purpose , that hee might know your estate , and comfort your hearts .
With Onesimus a faithfull and beloued brother , who is one of you . They shall make knowen vnto you all things which are done here .
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you , and Marcus sisters sonne to Barnabas , ( touching whome yee receiued commandements ; if he come vnto you , receiue him : )
And Iesus , which is called Iustus , who are of the circumcision . These onely are my fellow workers vnto the kingdome of God , which haue beene a comfort vnto me .

Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , & the church which is in his house .
And when this Epistle is read amongst you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans : and that ye likewise reade the Epistle from Laodicea ,
And say to Archippus , Take heede to the ministerie , which thou hast receiued in the Lord , that thou fulfill it .

In the thirde yere of the reigne of Iehoiakim King of Iudah , came Nebuchad - nezzar King of Babylon , vnto Ierusalem , and besieged it .
And the Lord gaue Iehoiakim king of Iudah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God , which he caried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god , and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
¶ And the king spake vnto Ashpenaz the master of his Eunuches , that he should bring certaine of the children of Israel , and of the kings seed , and of the Princes :
Children in whom was no blemish , but well fauoured , and skilfull in all wisedome , and cunning in knowledge , and vnderstanding science , and such as had abilitie in them to stand in the Kings palace , and whom they might teach the learning , and the tongue of the Caldeans .
And the King appointed them a daily prouision of the kings meat , and of the wine which he dranke : so nourishing them three yeeres , that at the ende thereof they might stand before the king .
Now among these were of the children of Iudah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah :
Unto whom the Prince of the Eunuches gaue names : for he gaue vnto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah of Abednego .
¶ But Daniel purposed in his heart , that he would not defile himselfe with the portion of the kings meat , nor with the wine which he dranke : therefore hee requested of the Prince of the Eunuches , that hee might not defile himselfe .
Now God had brought Daniel into fauour and tender loue with the Prince of the Eunuches .
And the Prince of the Eunuches said vnto Daniel , I feare my lord the king , who hath appointed your meat , and your drinke : for why should he see your faces worse liking then the children which are of your sort ? then shall yee make mee indanger my head to the King .
Then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the Prince of the Eunuches had set ouer Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
Proue thy seruants , I beseech thee , ten dayes , and let them giue pulse to eat , and water to drinke .
Then let our countenances be looked vpon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the Kings meate : and as thou seest , deale with thy seruants .
So hee consented to them in this matter , and proued them ten dayes .
And at the end often dayes , their countenances appeared fairer , and fatter in flesh , then all the children , which did eate the portion of the kings meat .
Thus Melzar tooke away the portion of their meat , and the wine that they should drink : and gaue them pulse .
¶ As for these foure children , God gaue them knowledge , and skil in all learning and wisedome , and Daniel had vnderstanding in all visions and dreames .
Now at the end of the dayes that the King had said he should bring them in , then the Prince of the Eunuches brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
And the King communed with them : and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : therefore stood they before the King .
And in all matters of wisedome and vnderstanding that the king enquired of them , hee found them ten times better then all the Magicians and Astrologers that were in all his Realme .
<NON-VERSE>
And in the second yeere of the reigne of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchad - nezzar dreamed dreames , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleepe brake from him .
Then the King commanded to call the Magicians , and the Astrologers , and the Sorcerers , and the Caldeans , for to shew the King his dreames : so they came and stood before the king .
And the King said vnto them , I haue dreamed a dreame , and my spirit was troubled to know the dreame .
Then spake the Caldeans to the King in Syriacke ; O king , liue for euer : tell thy seruants the dreame , and we will shew the interpretation .
The King answered , and said to the Caldeans , The thing is gone from mee : if ye will not make knowen vnto me the dreame , with the interpretation thereof , yee shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shalbe made a dunghill .
But if yee shewe the dreame , and the interpretation thereof , yee shall receiue of me giftes and rewards , and great honour : therefore shewe me the dreame , and the interpretation thereof .
They answered againe , and said , Let the King tell his seruants the dreame , and we will shew the interpretation of it .
The King answered , and said , I know of certeinty that ye would gaine the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
But if yee will not make knowen vnto me the dreame , there is but one decree for you : for ye haue prepared lying , and corrupt words to speake before me , till the time be changed : therefore tell me the dreame , and I shall know that yee can shewe mee the interpretation thereof .
¶ The Caldeans answered before the King , and said , There is not a man vpon the earth that can shew the kings matter : therefore there is no King , lord , nor ruler , that asked such things at any Magician , or Astrologer , or Caldean .
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the King , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
For this cause the King was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
And the decree went foorth that the wise men should be slaine , and they sought Daniel and his fellowes to be slaine .
¶ Then Daniel answered with counsell and wisedome to Arioch the captaine of the Kings guard , which was gone foorth to slay the wise men of Babylon .
Hee answered and said to Arioch the Kings captaine , Why is the decree so hastie from the King ? Then Arioch made the thing knowen to Daniel .
Then Daniel went in and desired of the King , that hee would giue him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
Then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing knowen to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah his companions :
That they would desire mercies of the God of heauen concerning this secret , that Daniel and his fellowes should not perish with the rest of the Wise men of Babylon .
¶ Then was the secret reuealed vnto Daniel in a night vision : then Daniel blessed the God of heauen .
Daniel answered and said ; Blessed be the name of God for euer and euer : for wisedome and might are his :
And he changeth the times and the seasons : he remoueth Kings , and setteth vp Kings : he giueth wisedome vnto the wise , and knowledge to them that know vnderstanding .
He reuealeth the deepe and secret things : hee knoweth what is in the darknes , & the light dwelleth with him .
I thanke thee and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast giuen me wisedome and might , and hast made knowen vnto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made knowen vnto vs the kings matter .
¶ Therefore Daniel went in vnto Arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus vnto him , Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will shew vnto the king the interpretation .
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , & said thus vnto him , I haue found a man of the captiues of Iudah , that will make knowen vnto the king the interpretation .
The King answered and said to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar , Art thou able to make knowen vnto me the dreame which I haue seene , and the interpretation thereof ?
Daniel answered in the presence of the King , and said , The secret which the King hath demanded , cannot the wise men , the astrologians , the magicians , the southsaiers shew vnto the king :
But there is a God in heauen that reuealeth secrets , and maketh knowen to the king Nebuchad - nezzar , what shalbe in the latter dayes . Thy dreame , and the visions of thy head vpon thy bed , are these .
As for thee , O King , thy thoughts came into thy minde vpon thy bed , what should come to passe hereafter : and he that reuealeth secrets , maketh knowen to thee , what shall come to passe .
But as for me , this secret is not reuealed to me , for any wisdome that I haue more then any liuing , but for their sakes that shall make knowen the interpretation to the King , and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart .
¶ Thou , O King , sawest , and behold a great image : this great image whose brightnesse was excelleut , stood before thee , and the forme thereof was terrible .
This images head was of fine gold , his breast and his armes of siluer , his belly and his thighes of brasse :
His legs of yron , his feete part of yron , and part of clay .
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands , which smote the image vpon his feete that were of yron and clay , and brake them to pieces .
Then was the yron , the clay , the brasse , the siluer , and the golde broken to pieces together , and became like the chaffe of the summer threshing floores , and the wind caried them away , that no place was found for them : & the stone that smote the image became a great mountaine , and filled the whole earth .
¶ This is the dreame , and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the King .
Thou , O King , art a king of Kings : for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome , power , and strength , and glory .
And wheresoeuer the children of men dwel , the beasts of the field , and the foules of the heauen hath he giuen into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler ouer them all : thou art this head of gold .
And after thee shall arise an other kingdome inferiour to thee , and another third kingdome of brasse , which shall beare rule ouer all the earth .
And the fourth kingdome shall be strong as yron : forasmuch as yron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things ; and as yron that breaketh all these , shall it breake in pieces and bruise .
And whereas thou sawest the feete and toes , part of potters clay , and part of yron : the kingdome shalbe diuided , but there shalbe in it of the strength of the yron , forasmuch as thou sawest the yron mixt with myrie clay .
And as the toes of the feete were part of yron , and part of clay ; so the kingdome shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
And whereas thou sawest yron mixt with myrie clay , they shall mingle themselues with the seede of men : but they shall not cleaue one to an other , euen as yron is not mixed with clay .
And in the daies of these Kings shall the God of heauen set vp a kingdome , which shall neuer be destroyed : and the Kingdome shall not be left to other people , but it shall breake in pieces , and consume all these kingdomes , and it shall stand for euer .
Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountaine without hands , and that it brake in pieces the yron , the brasse , the clay , the siluer , and the gold : the great God hath made knowen to the King what shall come to passe hereafter , & the dreame is certaine , and the interpretation thereof sure .
¶ Then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell vpon his face , and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation , and sweet odours vnto him .
The King answered vnto Daniel and said , Of a trueth it is , that your God is a God of gods , and a Lord of Kings , and a reuealer of secrets , seeing thou couldest reueale this secret .
Then the King made Daniel a great man , and gaue him many great gifts , & made him ruler ouer the whole prouince of Babylon , and chiefe of the gouernours ouer all the wise men of Babylon .
<NON-VERSE>
Nebuchad - nezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof sixe cubites : he set it vp in the plaine of Dura , in the prouince of Babylon . Then Nebuchad - nezzar the king sent to gather together the Princes , the Gouernours , and the Captaines , the Iudges , the Treasurers , the Counsellers , the Sherifes , and all the rulers of the Prouinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchad - nezzar the King had set vp .
Then the Princes , the Gouernours and Captaines , the Iudges , the Treasurers , the Counsellers , the Sherifes , and all the rulers of the Prouinces were gathered together vnto the dedication of the image , that Nebuchadnezzar the King had set vp , and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set vp .
Then an herauld cryed aloud , To you it is commaunded , O people , nations , and languages ,
That at what time yee heare the sound of the cornet , flute , harpe , sackbut , psalterie , dulcimer , and all kinds of musicke , yee fall downe , and worship the golden image that Nebuchad - nezzar the King hath set vp :
And who so falleth not down and worshippeth , shall the same houre bee cast into the middest of a burning fierie furnace .
Therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harpe , sackbut , psalterie , and all kindes of musicke , all the people , the nations , and the languages fell downe and worshipped the golden image , that Nebuchad - nezzar the King had set vp .
¶ Wherefore at that time certaine Caldeans came neere , and accused the Iewes .
They spake and sayd to the King Nebuchad - nezzar , O King , liue for euer .
Thou , O King , hast made a decree , that euery man that shal heare the sound of the cornet , flute , harpe , sackbut , psalterie , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musicke , shall fall downe and worship the golden image :
And who so falleth not downe & worshippeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fierie furnace .
There are certain Iewes whom thou hast set ouer the affaires of the prouince of Babylon , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : these men , O King , haue not regarded thee , they serue not thy gods , nor worship the golden image , which thou hast set vp .
¶ Then Nebuchad - nezzar in his rage and furie commaunded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : then they brought these men before the King .
Nebuchad - nezzar spake and said vnto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego ? doe not yee serue my gods , nor worship the golden image which I haue set vp ?
Now if ye be ready that at what time yee heare the sound of the cornet , flute , harpe , sackbut , psalterie , and dulcimer , and all kindes of musicke , ye fall downe , and worship the image which I haue made , well : but if yee worship not , ye shall be cast the same houre into the midst of a fierie furnace , and who is that God that shall deliuer you out of my handes ?
Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered and said to the king ; O Nebuchad - nezzar , we are not carefull to answere thee in this matter .
If it be so , our God whom wee serue , is able to deliuer vs from the burning fierie furnace , and he will deliuer vs out of thine hand , O king .
But if not , bee it knowen vnto thee , O king , that we will not serue thy gods , nor worship thy golden image , which thou hast set vp .
¶ Then was Nebuchad - nezzar full of furie , and the forme of his visage was changed against Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego : therefore he spake and commanded , that they should heat the furnace one seuen times more then it was wont to be heat .
And hee commaunded the most mighty men that were in his armie , to binde Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , and to cast them into the burning fierie furnace .
Then these men were bound in their coates , their hosen , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fierie furnace .
Therefore because the Kings commandement was vrgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that tooke vp Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego .
And these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell downe bound into the midst of the burning fierie furnace .
Then Nebuchad - nezzar the king was astonied , and rose vp in haste , and spake and said vnto his counsellers , Did not wee cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? They answered and said vnto the king ; True , O king .
He answered and said , Loe , I see foure men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they haue no hurt , and the forme of the fourth is like the sonne of God .
¶ Then Nebuchad - nezzar came neere to the mouth of the burning fierie furnace , and spake and said , Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , ye seruants of the most High God , come forth , and come hither . Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came forth of the midst of the fire .
And the princes , gouernours , and captaines , and the kings counsellers , being gathered together , saw these men , vpon whose bodies the fire had no power , nor was an haire of their head singed , neither were their coats changed , nor the smell of fire had passed on them .
Then Nebuchad - nezzar spake and said ; Blessed bee the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , who hath sent his Angel , and deliuered his seruants that trusted in him , and haue changed the Kings word , and yeelded their bodies , that they might not serue nor worship any God , except their owne God .
Therefore I make a decree , That euery people , nation , and language , which speake any thing amisse against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , shall be cut in pieces , and their houses shall be made a dunghill , because there is no other God , that can deliuer after this sort .

Nebuchad - nezzar the king , vnto all people , nations , and languages that dwell in all the earth , Peace be multiplied vnto you .
I thought it good to shew the signes , and wonders , that the high God hath wrought toward me .
How great are his signes ? and how mighty are his wonders ? his kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
¶ I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house , and flourishing in my palace .
I saw a dreame which made me afraid , and the thoughts vpon my bed , and the visions of my head troubled me .
Therefore made I a decree , to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before mee , that they might make knowen vnto me the interpretation of the dreame .
Then came in the Magicians , the Astrologers , the Caldeans , and the Southsayers : and I tolde the dreame before them ; but they did not make knowen vnto mee the interpretation thereof .
¶ But at the last Daniel came in before me , ( whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my God , and in whom is the spirit of the holy Gods ) & before him I told the dreame , saying ,
O Belteshazzar , master of the Magicians , because I know that the spirit of the holy Gods is in thee , and no secret troubleth thee , tell me the visions of my dreame that I haue seene , and the interpretation thereof .
Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the middest of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
The tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached vnto heauen , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth .
The leaues thereof were faire , and the fruite thereof much , and in it was meate for all : the beasts of the field had shadow vnder it , and the foules of the heauen dwelt in the boughes thereof , and all flesh was fed of it .
I sawe in the visions of my head vpon my bed , & behold , a watcher and an holy one came downe from heauen .
He cryed aloude , and said thus ; Hew downe the tree , and cut off his branches ; shake off his leaues , and scatter his fruite ; let the beasts get away from vnder it , and the foules from his branches .
Neuerthelesse leaue the stumpe of his rootes in the earth , euen with a band of yron and brasse , in the tender grasse of the field , and let it be wet with the dew of heauen , and let his portion be with the beastes in the grasse of the earth .
Let his heart bee changed from mans , and let a beasts heart be giuen vnto him , and let seuen times passe ouer him .
This matter is by the decree of the watchers , and the demaund by the word of the Holy ones : to the intent that the liuing may know , that the most High ruleth in the kingdome of men , and giueth it to whomsoeuer hee will , and setteth vp ouer it the basest of men .
This dreame , I king Nebuchadnezzar haue seene : Now thou , O Belteshazzar , declare the interpretation thereof , forasmuch as all the Wise men of my kingdome are not able to make knowen vnto mee the interpretation : but thou art able , for the spirit of the holy Gods is in thee .
¶ Then Daniel ( whose name was Belteshazzar ) was astonied for one houre , and his thoughts troubled him : The King spake , and said , Belteshazzar , let not the dreame , or the interpretation thereof trouble thee . Belteshazzar answered ; and said ; My lord , the dreame be to them that hate thee , and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies .
The tree that thou sawest , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached vnto the heauen , and the sight thereof to all the earth :
Whose leaues were faire , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meate for all , vnder which the beasts of the field dwelt , and vpon whose branches the foules of the heauen had their habitation :
It is thou , O King , that art growen and become strong : for thy greatnesse is growen and reacheth vnto heauen , and thy dominion to the end of the earth .
And whereas the King saw a watcher , and an holy one comming downe from heauen , and saying , Hew the tree downe , and destroy it , yet leaue the stumpe of the rootes thereof in the earth , euen with a band of yron and brasse in the tender grasse of the field , and let it be wet with the dewe of heauen , and let his portion be with the beasts of the field , till seuen times passe ouer him : This is the interpretation , O king , & this is the decree of the most Hie , which is come vpon my lord the king :
That they shall driue thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field , and they shall make thee to eate grasse as oxen , and they shall wet thee with the dew of heauen , and seuen times shall passe ouer thee , till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdome of men , and giueth it to whomsoeuer he will .
And whereas they commanded to leaue the stumpe of the tree rootes ; thy kingdome shall be sure vnto thee , after that thou shalt haue knowen that the heauens doe rule .
Wherefore , O King , let my counsell be acceptable vnto thee , and breake off thy sinnes by righteousnesse , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poore ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillitie .
¶ All this came vpon the King Nebuchad - nezzar .
At the end of twelue moneths he walked in the palace of the kingdome of Babylon .
The King spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I haue built for the house of the kingdome , by the might of my power , and for the honour of my maiestie ?
While the word was in the Kings mouth , there fell a voice from heauen , saying , O King Nebuchad - nezzar , to thee it is spoken ; The kingdome is departed from thee .
And they shall driue thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field ; they shall make thee to eate grasse as oxen , and seuen times shall passe ouer thee , vntill thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdome of men , and giueth it to whomsoeuer he will .
The same houre was the thing fulfilled vpon Nebuchad - nezzar , and he was driuen from men , and did eate grasse as oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heauen , till his haires were growen like Egles feathers , and his nailes like birds clawes .
And at the end of the dayes , I Nebuchad - nezzar lift vp mine eyes vnto heauen , and mine vnderstanding returned vnto me , and I blessed the most high , and I praised , and honoured him that liueth for euer , whose dominion is an euerlasting dominion , and his kingdome is from generation to generation .
And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing : and hee doth according to his will in the armie of heauen , and among the inhabitants of the earth : and none can stay his hand , or say vnto him , What doest thou ?
At the same time my reason returned vnto me , and for the glory of my kingdome , mine honour , and brightnes returned vnto me , and my counsellers , and my Lords sought vnto me , and I was established in my kingdome , and excellent Maiestie was added vnto me .

Belshazzar the King made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords , and dranke wine before the thousand .
Belshazzar , whiles he tasted the wine , commaunded to bring the golden and siluer vessels , which his father Nebuchad - nezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Ierusalem , that the king and his princes , his wiues , and his concubines might drinke therein .
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God , which was at Ierusalem , and the king and his princes , his wiues , and his concubines dranke in them .
They drunke wine , and praised the gods of gold and of siluer , of brasse , of yron , of wood , and of stone .
¶ In the same houre came forth fingers of a mans hand , and wrote ouer against the candlesticke vpon the plaister of the wall of the Kings palace , and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
Then the kings countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the ioints of his loines were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
The king cried aloud to bring in the Astrologers , the Caldeans , and the soothsayers : and the king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon , Whosoeuer shall reade this writing , and shewe me the interpretation thereof , shall bee clothed with scarlet , and haue a chaine of gold about his necke , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdome .
Then came in all the kings wise men , but they could not reade the writing , nor make knowen to the king the interpretation thereof .
Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his lordes were astonied .
¶ Now the queene , by reason of the wordes of the king and his lords , came into the banquet house , and the queene spake and said , O king , liue for euer : let not thy thoughts trouble thee , nor let thy countenance be changed .
There is a man in thy kingdom , in whome is the spirit of the holy gods , and in the dayes of thy father light and vnderstanding and wisedome like the wisedome of the gods , was found in him : whom the king Nebuchad - nezzar thy father , the king , Isay , thy father made master of the magicians , astrologers , Caldeans , and soothsayers ,
Forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and vnderstanding , interpreting of dreames , and shewing of hard sentences , & dissoluing of doubts were found in the same Daniel , whom the king named Belteshazzar : now let Daniel be called , and he will shewe the interpretation .
Then was Daniel brought in before the king , and the king spake and said vnto Daniel , Art thou that Daniel , which art of the children of the captiuity of Iudah , whom the king my father brought out of Iewrie ?
I haue euen heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light , and vnderstanding , and excellent wisedome is found in thee .
And now the wise men , the astrologers haue bene brought in before me , that they should reade this writing , and make knowen vnto me the interpretation thereof : but they could not shewe the interpretation of the thing .
And I haue heard of thee , that thou canst make interpretations , and dissolue doubts : now if thou canst read the writing , and make knowen to mee the interpretation thereof , thou shalt be clothed with scarlet , & haue a chaine of gold about thy necke , and shalt bee the third ruler in the kingdome .
¶ Then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thy selfe , and giue thy rewards to an other , yet I will reade the writing vnto the king , and make knowen to him the interpretation .
O thou king , the most high God gaue Nebuchad - nezzar thy father a kingdome , and maiestie , and glory , and honour .
And for the maiestie that hee gaue him , all people , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him : whom he would , he slew , & whom he would , he kept aliue , and whom he would hee set vp , and whom he would hee put downe .
But when his heart was lifted vp , and his minde hardened in pride : hee was deposed from his kingly throne , and they tooke his glory from him .
And hee was driuen from the sonnes of men , and his heart was made like the beasts , and his dwelling was with the wilde asses : they fed him with grasse like oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heauen , till hee knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdome of men , and that hee appointeth ouer it whomsoeuer he will .
And thou his sonne , O Belshazzar , hast not humbled thine heart , though thou knewest all this :
¶ And this is the writing that was written , MENE , MENE , TEKEL VPHARSIN .
This is the interpretation of the thing , MENE , God hath numbred thy kingdome , and finished it .
TEKEL , thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting .
PERES , thy kingdome is diuided , and giuen to the Medes and Persians .
Then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with scarlet , and put a chaine of gold about his necke , and made a Proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdome .
¶ In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Caldeans slaine .
<NON-VERSE>
It pleased Darius to set ouer the kingdome an hundred and twenty Princes , which should be ouer the whole kingdome .
And ouer these , three Presidents , ( of whom Daniel was first ) that the Princes might giue accompts vnto them , and the King should haue no damage .
Then this Daniel was preferred aboue the Presidents , and Princes , because an excellent spirit was in him , and the king thought to set him ouer the whole realme .
¶ Then the Presidents and Princes sought to finde occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdome , but they could finde none occasion , nor fault : forasmuch as he was faithfull , neither was there any errour or fault found in him .
Then said these men , We shall not finde any occasion against this Daniel , except wee finde it against him concerning the Law of his God .
Then these Presidents and Princes assembled together to the king , and said thus vnto him , King Darius , liue foreuer .
All the Presidents of the kingdome , the gouernours , and the Princes , the counsellers and the captaines haue consulted together to establish a royall statute , and to make a firme decree , that whosoeuer shall aske a petition of any God or man for thirty dayes , saue of thee , O King , hee shall be cast into the denne of Lions .
Now , O king , establish the decree , and signe the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes & Persians , which altereth not .
Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree .
¶ Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed , hee went into his house , and his windowes being open in his chamber toward Ierusalem , hee kneeled vpon his knees three times a day , and prayed , and gaue thankes before his God , as hee did afore time .
Then these men assembled , and found Daniel praying , and making supplication before his God .
Then they came neere , and spake before the king concerning the kings decree ; Hast thou not signed a decree , that euery man that shall aske a petition of any God or man , within thirty dayes , saue of thee , O king , shalbe cast into the denne of Lions ? The king answered and said , The thing is true , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not .
Then answered they and said before the king ; That Daniel which is of the captiuity of the children of Iudah , regardeth not thee , O king , nor the decree that thou hast signed , but maketh his petition three times a day .
Then the king , when hee heard these wordes , was sore displeased with himselfe , and set his heart on Daniel to deliuer him : and he laboured till the going downe of the sunne , to deliuer him .
Then these men assembled vnto the king , and said vnto the king , Know O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth , may bee changed .
Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the denne of Lions : now the king spake and saide vnto Daniel ; Thy God , whom thou seruest continually , he will deliuer thee .
And a stone was brought and laid vpon the mouth of the denne , and the King sealed it with his owne signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
¶ Then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musicke brought before him , and his sleepe went from him .
Then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste vnto the den of Lyons .
And when he came to the den , he cryed with a lamentable voice vnto Daniel , and the king spake and said to Daniel : O Daniel , seruant of the liuing God , Is thy God whom thou seruest continually , able to deliuer thee from the Lyons ?
Then said Daniel vnto the king , O king , liue for euer .
My God hath sent his Angel , and hath shut the lyons mouthes that they haue not hurt me : forasmuch as before him , innocencie was found in me ; and also before thee , O king , haue I done no hurt .
Then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel vp out of the denne : so Daniel was taken vp out of the den , and no maner of hurt was found vpon him , because he beleeued in his God .
¶ And the king commanded , and they brought those men which had accused Daniel , and they cast them into the den of Lyons , them , their children , and their wiues : and the Lyons had the mastery of them , and brake all their bones in pieces or euer they came at the bottome of the den .
¶ Then king Darius wrote vnto all people , nations , and languages that dwell in all the earth ; Peace be multiplied vnto you .
I make a decree , That in euery dominion of my kingdome , men tremble and feare before the God of Daniel : for he is the liuing God , and stedfast for euer , and his kingdome that , which shal not be destroyed , and his dominion shall be euen vnto the end .
He deliuereth and rescueth , and he worketh signes and wonders in heauen and in earth : who hath deliuered Daniel from the power of the lyons .
<NON-VERSE> In the first yeere of Belshazzar king of Babylon , Daniel had a dreame , and visions of his head vpon his bed : then he wrote the dreame , and tolde the summe of the matters .
Daniel spake , and said , I saw in my vision by night , & behold , the foure windes of the heauen stroue vpon the great Sea .
And foure great beastes came vp from the sea , diuers one from another .
The first was like a Lyon , and had Eagles wings : I beheld till the wings thereof were pluckt , and it was lifted vp from the earth , and made stand vpon the feete as a man , and a mans heart was giuen to it .
And behold , another beast , a second , like to a Beare , and it raised vp it selfe on one side , and it had three ribbes in the mouth of it betweene the teeth of it , and they said thus vnto it , Arise , deuoure much flesh .
After this I beheld , and loe , another like a Leopard , which had vpon the backe of it foure wings of a foule , the beast had also foure heads , and dominion was giuen to it .
After this I saw in the night visions , and behold , a fourth beast , dreadfull and terrible , and strong exceedingly ; and it had great yron teeth : it deuoured and brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with the feete of it , and it was diuers from all the beasts that were before it , and it had ten hornes .
I considered the hornes , and behold , there came vp among them another little horne , before whom there were three of the first hornes pluckt vp by the roots : and behold , in this horne were eyes like the eyes of man , and a mouth speaking great things .
¶ I beheld till the thrones were cast downe , and the Ancient of dayes did sit , whose garment was white as snow , and the haire of his head like the pure wooll : his throne was like the fierie flame , and his wheeles as burning fire .
A fierie streame issued , and came foorth from before him : thousand thousands ministred vnto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the iudgement was set , and the bookes were opened .
I beheld then , because of the voice of the great words which the horne spake : I beheld euen till the beast was slaine , and his body destroyed , and giuen to the burning flame .
As concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away : yet their liues were prolonged for a season and time .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , one like the sonne of man , came with the clouds of heauen , and came to the Ancient of daies , and they brought him neere before him .
And there was giuen him dominion and glory , and a kingdome , that all people , nations , and languages should serue him : his dominion is an euerlasting dominion , which shall not passe away ; and his kingdome that , which shall not be destroyed .
¶ I Daniel was grieued in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came neere vnto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this : so he told mee , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
These great beasts , which are foure , are foure Kings , which shall arise out of the earth .
But the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdome , & possesse the kingdome for euer , euen for euer & euer .
Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diuerse from al the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of yron , and his nailes of brasse , which deuoured , brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with his feete ,
And of the ten hornes that were in his head , and of the other , which came vp , and before whom three fell , euen of that horne that had eyes , and a mouth that spake very great things , whose looke was more stout then his fellowes .
I beheld , and the same horne made warre with the Saints , and preuailed against them ;
Untill the Ancient of daies came , and iudgment was giuen to the Saints of the most high : and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdome .
Thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdome vpon earth , which shall be diuerse from all kingdomes , & shall deuoure the whole earth , and shall tread it downe , and breake it in pieces .
And the tenne hornes out of this kingdome are tenne Kings that shall arise : and an other shall rise after them , and he shall be diuerse from the first , and he shall subdue three Kings .
And he shall speake great words against the most high , and shall weare out the Saints of the most high , and thinke to change times , and lawes : and they shall be giuen into his hand , vntill a time and times , & the diuiding of time .
But the iudgement shall sit , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume , and to destroy it vnto the end .
And the kingdome and dominion , and the greatnesse of the kingdome vnder the whole heauen , shall be giuen to the people of the Saints of the most high , whose kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome , and all dominions shall serue and obey him .

In the third yeere of the reigne of King Belshazzar , a vision appeared vnto mee , euen vnto me Daniel , after that which appeared vnto me at the first .
And I saw in a vision ( and it came to passe when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the prouince of Elam ) and I saw in a vision , and I was by the riuer of Ulai .
Then I lifted vp mine eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the riuer , a ramme which had two hornes , and the two hornes were high : but one was higher then the other , and the higher came vp last .
I saw the ramme pushing Westward , & Northward , and Southward : so that no beasts might stand before him , neither was there any that could deliuer out of his hand , but he did according to his will , and became great .
And as I was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , & touched not the ground : and the goate had a notable horne betweene his eyes .
And he came to the ramme that had two hornes , which I had seene standing before the riuer , and ranne vnto him in the furie of his power .
And I saw him come close vnto the ramme , and he was mooued with choler against him , and smote the ramme , and brake his two hornes , and there was no power in the ramme to stand before him , but he cast him downe to the ground , and stamped vpon him , and there was none that could deliuer the ramme out of his hand .
Therefore the hee goate waxed very great , and when he was strong , the great horne was broken : and for it came vp foure notable ones , toward the foure windes of heauen .
And out of one of them came forth a litle horne , which waxed exceeding great , toward the South , and toward the East , and toward the pleasant land .
And it waxed great euen to the hoste of heauen , and it cast downe some of the hoste , and of the starres to the ground , and stamped vpon them .
Yea he magnified himselfe euen to the prince of the hoste , and by him the dayly sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his Sanctuary was cast down .
And an hoste was giuen him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast downe the trueth to the ground , and it practised , and prospered .
¶ Then I heard one Saint speaking , and another Saint saide vnto that certaine Saint which spake , How long shall bee the vision concerning the daily sacrifice , and the transgression of desolation , to giue both the Sanctuary , and the hoste to be troden vnder foot ?
And he said vnto me , Unto two thousand and three hundred dayes : then shall the Sanctuary be clensed .
¶ And it came to passe , when I , euen I Daniel had seene the vision , and sought for the meaning , then beholde , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
And I heard a mans voyce betweene the bankes of Ulai , which called and said , Gabriel , make this man to vnderstand the vision .
So he came neere where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell vpon my face : but he said vnto mee , Understand , O sonne of man : for at the time of the end shalbe the vision .
Now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deepe sleepe on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me vpright .
And he said , Behold , I wil make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shalbe .
The ramme which thou sawest hauing two hornes , are the kings of Media , and Persia .
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia , and the great horne that is betweene his eyes , is the first king .
Now that being broken , whereas foure stood vp for it , foure kingdomes shall stand vp out of the nation , but not in his power .
And in the latter time of their kingdome , when the transgressours are come to the full , a king of fierce countenance , and vnderstanding darke sentences , shall stand vp .
And his power shall be mighty , but not by his owne power : and hee shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mightie , and the holy people .
And through his policie also hee shall cause craft to prosper in his hand , and hee shall magnifie himselfe in his heart , and by peace shal destroy many : he shall also stand vp against the prince of princes , but he shalbe broken without hand .
And the vision of the euening , and the morning , which was tolde , is true : wherfore shut thou vp the vision , for it shalbe for many dayes .

In the first yeere of Darius the sonne of Ahasuerus , of the seede of the Medes , which was made King ouer the realme of the Caldeans ,
In the first yeere of his reigne , I Daniel vnderstood by bookes the number of the yeeres , whereof the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah the Prophet , that he would accomplish seuentie yeeres in the desolations of Ierusalem .
¶ And I set my face vnto the Lord God to seeke by prayer , and supplications , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes .
And I prayed vnto the Lord my God , and made my confession , and said ; O Lord , the great and dreadfull God , keeping the couenant , and mercy to them that loue him , and to them that keepe his Commandements :
We haue sinned , and haue committed iniquitie , and haue done wickedly , and haue rebelled , euen by departing from thy precepts , and from thy iudgements .
Neither haue we hearkened vnto thy seruants the Prophets , which spake in thy Name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
O Lord , righteousnes belongeth vnto thee , but vnto vs confusion of faces , as at this day : to the men of Iudah , and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem , and vnto all Israel that are neere , and that are farre off , through all the countreys whither thou hast driuen them , because of their trespasse , that they haue trespassed against thee .
O Lord , to vs belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers ; because we haue sinned against thee .
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiuenesses , though we haue rebelled against him .
Neither haue we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God , to walke in his Lawes which he set before vs , by his seruants the Prophets .
Yea , all Israel haue transgressed thy Law , euen by departing , that they might not obey thy voice , therefore the curse is powred vpon vs , and the othe that is written in the Law of Moses the seruant of God , because we haue sinned against him .
And he hath confirmed his words which he spake against vs , and against our Iudges that iudged vs , by bringing vpon vs a great euill : for vnder the whole heauen hath not bene done , as hath bene done vpon Ierusalem .
As it is written in the Law of Moses , all this euill is come vpon vs : yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God , that we might turne from our iniquities , and vnderstand thy trueth .
Therefore hath the Lord watched vpon the euil , and brought it vpon vs : for the Lord our God is righteous in all his workes , which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
And now O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renowne , as at this day , wee haue sinned , wee haue done wickedly .
¶ O Lord , according to all thy righteousnes , I beseech thee , let thine anger and thy furie bee turned away from thy citie Ierusalem , thy holy Mountaine : because for our sinnes , and for the iniquities of our fathers , Ierusalem and thy people are become a reproch to all that are about vs .
Now therefore , O our God , heare the prayer of thy seruant , and his supplications , and cause thy face to shine vpon thy Sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lords sake .
O my God , encline thine eare and heare : open thine eyes , and behold our desolations , & the city , which is called by thy name : for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses , but for thy great mercies .
O Lord heare , O Lord forgiue , O Lord hearken and doe : deferre not for thine owne sake , O my God : for thy citie , & thy people are called by thy Name .
¶ And whiles I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sinne , and the sinne of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God , for the holy Mountaine of my God :
Yea whiles I was speaking in praier , euen the man Gabriel , whom I had seene in the vision at the beginning , being caused to flie swiftly , touched me about the time of the euening oblation .
And he informed mee , and talked with mee , and said ; O Daniel , I am now come foorth to giue thee skill and vnderstanding .
At the beginning of thy supplications the commandement came forth , and I am come to shew thee : for thou art greatly beloued : therefore vnderstand the matter , & consider the vision .
Seuentie weekes are determined vpon thy people , and vpon thy holy citie , to finish the transgression , and to make an ende of sinnes , and to make reconciliation for iniquitie , and to bring in euerlasting righteousnes , and to seale vp the vision and prophecie , and to anoynt the most Holy .
Know therefore and vnderstand , that from the going foorth of the commandement to restore and to build Ierusalem , vnto the Messiah the Prince , shall be seuen weekes ; and threescore and two weekes , the street shall be built againe , and the wall , euen in troublous times .
And after threescore and two weekes , shall Messiah be cut off , but not for himselfe , and the people of the Prince that shall come , shall destroy the citie , and the Sanctuarie , and the ende thereof shall be with a flood , and vnto the ende of the warre desolations are determined .

In the third yere of Cyrus King of Persia , a thing was reuealed vnto Daniel ( whose name was called Belteshazzar ) and the thing was true , but the time appointed was long , and he vnderstood the thing , and had vnderstanding of the vision .
In those dayes , I Daniel was mourning three full weekes .
I ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh , nor wine in my mouth , neither did I anoynt my selfe at all , till three whole weekes were fulfilled .
And in the foure and twentieth day of the first moneth , as I was by the side of the great riuer , which is Hiddekel :
Then I lift vp mine eyes and looked , and behold , a certaine man clothed in linen , whose loynes were girded with fine gold of Uphaz .
His body also was like the Berill , and his face as the appearance of lightning , and his eyes as lampes of fire , and his armes , and his feete like in colour to polished brasse , and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude .
And I Daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with mee saw not the vision : but a great quaking fell vpon them , so that they fled to hide themselues .
Therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comelinesse was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
Yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his wordes , then was I in a deepe sleepe on my face , and my face toward the ground .
¶ And behold , an hand touched me , which set me vpon my knees , and vpon the palmes of my hands .
And hee said vnto me , O Daniel , a man greatly beloued , vnderstand the wordes that I speake vnto thee , and stand vpright : for vnto thee am I now sent ; and when he had spoken this word vnto me , I stood trembling .
Then sayd hee vnto me ; Feare not , Daniel : for from the first day that thou diddest set thine heart to vnderstand , and to chasten thy selfe before thy God , thy wordes were heard , and I am come for thy words .
But the prince of the kingdome of Persia withstood mee one and twentie dayes : but loe , Michael one of the chiefe Princes came to helpe mee , and I remained there with the Kings of Persia .
Now I am come to make thee vnderstand what shall befall thy people , in the latter dayes : for yet the vision is for many dayes .
And when hee had spoken such words vnto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumbe .
And behold , one like the similitude of the sonnes of men touched my lippes : then I opened my mouth , and spake , and sayd vnto him that stoode before me ; O my Lord , by the vision my sorrowes are turned vpon me , and I haue retained no strength .
For how can the seruant of this my Lord , talke with this my Lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in mee , neither is there breath left in me .
Then there came againe and touched me one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthned me ,
And said ; O man greatly beloued , feare not : peace be vnto thee , be strong , yea be strong ; and when he had spoken vnto me , I was strengthened , and said ; Let my Lord speake ; for thou hast strengthened me .
Then said hee , Knowest thou wherefore I come vnto thee ? and now will I returne to fight with the prince of Persia : and when I am gone forth , loe , the prince of Grecia shall come .

Also I , in the first yeere of Darius the Mede , euen I stood to confirme and to strengthen him .
And now will I shew thee the trueth . Behold , there shall stand vp yet three Kings in Persia , & the fourth shalbe farre richer then they all : and by his strength through his riches he shall stirre vp all against the realme of Grecia .
And a mighty King shal stand vp , that shall rule with great dominion , and doe according to his will .
And when he shall stand vp , his kingdome shall be broken , and shall be diuided toward the foure winds of heauen ; and not to his posteritie , nor according to his dominion which he ruled : for his kingdome shall be pluckt vp , euen for others besides those .
¶ And the King of the South shall be strong , and one of his princes , and he shall be strong aboue him , and haue dominion : his dominion shall be a great dominion .
And in the end of yeeres they shall ioyne themselues together : for the Kings daughter of the South shall come to the King of the North to make an agreement , but she shall not retaine the power of the arme , neither shall he stand , nor his arme : but she shall be giuen vp , and they that brought her , and he that begate her , and he that strengthened her in these times .
But out of a branch of her rootes shall one stand vp in his estate , which shall come with an armie , and shall enter into the fortresse of the King of the North , and shall deale against them , and shall preuaile :
And shall also carie captiues into Egypt their gods with their princes , and with their precious vessels of siluer and of gold , and he shall continue moe yeeres then the King of the North .
So the King of the South shall come into his kingdome , and shall returne into his owne land .
But his sonnes shall be stirred vp , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come and ouerflow and passe through : then shall he returne , and be stirred vp euen to his fortresse .
And the King of the South shall be moued with choler , and shall come forth and fight with him , euen with the King of the North : and hee shall set forth a great multitude , but the multitude shall be giuen into his hand .
And when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted vp : and he shall cast downe many tenne thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
For the King of the North shall returne , and shall set forth a multitude greater then the former , and shall certainly come ( after certaine yeeres ) with a great armie & with much riches .
And in those times there shall many stand vp against the King of the South : also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselues to establish the vision , but they shall fall .
So the King of the North shall come , and cast vp a mount , and take the most fenced cities , and the armes of the South shall not withstand , neither his chosen people , neither shall there be any strength to withstand .
But he that commeth against him , shall doe according to his owne will , and none shall stand before him : and he shall stand in the glorious land , which by his hand shall be consumed .
He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdome and vpright ones with him : thus shall he doe , and he shall giue him the daughter of women corrupting her : but she shall not stand on his side , neither be for him .
After this shall he turne his face vnto the yles , and shall take many , but a prince for his own behalfe shall cause the reproch offred by him to cease without his owne reproch : he shall cause it to turne vpon him .
Then he shall turne his face towards the fort of his owne lande : but he shall stumble and fall , and not bee found .
Then shall stand vp in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdome , but within few dayes he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battell .
And in his estate shall stand vp a vile person , to whom they shal not giue the honour of the kingdome : but hee shall come in peaceably , and obtaine the kingdome by flatteries .
And with the armes of a flood shall they bee ouerflowen from before him , and shall be broken : yea also the prince of the couenant .
And after the league made with him he shall worke deceitfully , for hee shall come vp , and shall become strong with a small people .
He shall enter peaceably euen vpon the fattest places of the prouince , and he shall doe that which his fathers haue not done , nor his fathers fathers , he shall scatter among them the praye and spoile , and riches : yea and he shall forecast his deuices against the strong holdes , euen for a time .
And he shall stirre vp his power , and his courage against the king of the South with a great army , and the king of the South shall bee stirred vp to battell with a very great and mightie armie : but he shall not stand : for they shall forecast deuices against him .
Yea they that feede of the portion of his meate , shall destroy him , and his armie shall ouerflow : and many shall fall downe slaine .
And both these kings hearts shall be to doe mischiefe , and they shall speake lies at one table : but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall bee at the time appointed .
Then shall hee returne into his land with great riches , and his heart shall be against the holy couenant : and he shall doe exploits , and returne to his owne land .
At the time appointed he shall returne , and come toward the South : but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
¶ For the ships of Chittim shall come against him : therefore he shall be grieued and returne , and haue indignation against the holy Couenant : so shal he doe , he shall euen returne , and haue intelligence with them that forsake the holy Couenant .
And armes shal stand on his part , and they shall pollute the Sanctuarie of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shal place the abomination that maketh desolate .
And such as doe wickedly against the couenant , shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their God , shall be strong and doe exploits .
And they that vnderstand among the people shall instruct many : yet they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captiuitie , and by spoile many dayes .
Now when they shall fall , they shalbe holpen with a litle help : but many shall cleaue to them with flatteries .
And some of them of vnderstanding shall fall , to trie them , and to purge , and to make them white , euen to the time of the end : because it is yet for a time appointed .
And the king shall doe according to his will , and he shall exalt himselfe , and magnifie himselfe aboue euery god , and shall speake marueilous things against the God of gods , & shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished : for that that is determined , shall be done .
Neither shall hee regard the god of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god : for he shall magnifie himselfe aboue all .
But in his estate shall he honour the god of forces : and a God whome his fathers knew not , shall hee honour with gold , and siluer , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
Thus shall hee doe in the most strong holds with a strange god , whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory : and he shall cause them to rule ouer many , and shall diuide the land for gaine .
And at the time of the end shall the king of the South push at him , and the king of the North shal come against him like a whirlewind with charets , and with horsemen , and with many ships , and he shall enter into the countreys , and shall ouerflow and passe ouer .
He shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countreys shall be ouerthrowen : but these shall escape out of his hand , euen Edom , and Moab , and the chiefe of the children of Ammon .
He shall stretch foorth his hand also vpon the countreys , and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
But he shall haue power ouer the treasures of gold and of siluer , and ouer all the precious things of Egypt : and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shalbe at his steps .
But tidings out of the East , and out of the North shall trouble him : therefore he shall goe foorth with great fury to destroy , and vtterly to make away many .

And at that time shall Michael stand vp , the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people , and there shalbe a time of trouble , such as neuer was since there was a nation , euen to that same time : and at that time thy people shalbe deliuered , euery one that shalbe found written in the booke .
And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to euerlasting life , and some to shame and euerlasting contempt .
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament , and they that turne many to righteousnesse , as the starres for euer and euer .
But thou , O Daniel , shut vp the wordes , and seale the booke euen to the time of the ende : many shall runne to and fro , and knowledge shall bee increased .
¶ Then I Daniel looked , and behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the banke of the riuer , and the other on that side of the banke of the riuer .
And one said to the man clothed in linnen , which was vpon the waters of the riuer ; How long shall it bee to the end of these wonders ?
And I heard the man clothed in linnen , which was vpon the waters of the riuer , when he held vp his right hand , and his left hand vnto heauen , and sware by him that liueth for euer , that it shalbe for a time , times , and an halfe : and when hee shall haue accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people , all these things shall bee finished .
And I heard , but I vnderstood not : then said I , O my Lord , what shalbe the end of these things ?
And he said , Goe thy way , Daniel : for the wordes are closed vp and sealed till the time of the end .
Many shalbe purified , and made white and tried : but the wicked shall doe wickedly : and none of the wicked shall vnderstand , but the wise shall vnderstand .
And from the time that the dayly sacrifice shalbe taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set vp , there shalbe a thousand two hundred and ninetie dayes .
Blessed is he that waiteth , and commeth to the thousand , three hundred and fiue and thirtie dayes .

These bee the woordes which Moses spake vnto all Israel , on this side Iordane in the wildernes , in the plaine ouer against the Red sea , betweene Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
( There are eleuen daies iourney from Horeb , by the way of mount Seir , vnto Kadesh Barnea . )
And it came to passe in the fourtieth yeere , in the eleuenth moneth , on the first day of the moneth , that Moses spake vnto the children of Israel , according vnto all that the Lord had giuen him in commandement vnto them :
After hee had slaine Sihon the King of the Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the King of Bashan , which dwelt at Astaroth , in Edrei .
On this side Iordane , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying ,
The Lord our God spake vnto vs in Horeb , saying , Ye haue dwelt long ynough in this mount :
Turne you , and take your iourney , and goe to the mount of the Amorites , and vnto all the places nigh thereunto , in the plaine , in the hills , and in the vale , and in the South , and by the sea side , to the land of the Canaanites , and vnto Lebanon , vnto the great riuer , the riuer Euphrates .
Behold , I haue set the land before you : Goe in , and possesse the land , which the Lord sware vnto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Iacob , to giue vnto them , and to their seed after them .
¶ And I spake vnto you at that time , saying , I am not able to beare you my selfe alone :
The Lord your God hath multiplied you , and beholde , you are this day as the starres of heauen for multitude .
( The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many moe as ye are , and blesse you as he hath promised you . )
How can I my selfe alone beare your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
Take ye wise men , and vnderstanding , and knowen among your tribes , and I will make them rulers ouer you .
And ye answered me , and saide , The thing which thou hast spoken , is good for vs to doe .
So I tooke the chiefe of your tribes , wise men , and knowen , and made them heads ouer you , captaines ouer thousands , and captaines ouer hundreds , and captaines ouer fifties , and captaines ouer tennes , and officers among your tribes .
And I charged your Iudges at that time , saying , Heare the causes betweene your brethren , and iudge righteously betweene euery man and his brother , & the stranger that is with him .
Ye shall not respect persons in iudgement , but you shall heare the small aswell as the great : you shall not bee afraid of the face of man , for the iudgment is Gods : and the cause that is too hard for you , bring it vnto me , and I will heare it .
And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should doe .
¶ And when wee departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wildernes , which you saw by the way of the mountaine of the Amorites , as the Lord our God commanded vs : and wee came to Kadesh Barnea .
And I said vnto you , Ye are come vnto the mountaine of the Amorites , which the Lord our God doth giue vnto vs .
Behold , the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee : Goe vp , and possesse it , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said vnto thee : Feare not , neither be discouraged .
¶ And ye came neere vnto mee euery one of you , and said , We will send men before vs , and they shall search vs out the land , and bring vs word againe , by what way we must goe vp , and into what cities we shall come .
And the saying pleased mee well : and I tooke twelue men of you , one of a tribe .
And they turned and went vp into the mountaine , and came vnto the valley of Eshcol , and searched it out .
And they tooke of the fruit of the land in their handes , and brought it downe vnto vs , and brought vs worde againe , and said , It is a good lande which the Lord our God doeth giue vs .
Notwithstanding , ye would not goe vp , but rebelled against the commandement of the Lord your God .
And ye murmured in your tents and said , Because the Lord hated vs , he hath brought vs forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliuer vs into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy vs :
Whither shall wee goe vp ? our brethren haue discouraged our heart , saying , The people is greater and taller then we , the cities are great , and walled vp to heauen , and moreouer we haue seene the sonnes of the Anakims there .
Then I said vnto you , Dread not , neither be afraid of them .
The Lord your God which goeth before you , he shall fight for you , according to all that hee did for you in Egypt before your eyes :
And in the wildernes , where thou hast seene how that the Lord thy God bare thee , as a man doth beare his sonne , in all the way that ye went , vntil ye came into this place .
Yet in this thing ye did not beleeue the Lord your God ,
Who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should goe , and in a cloud by day .
And the Lord heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and sware , saying ,
Surely there shall not one of these men of this euill generation see that good land , which I sware to giue vnto your fathers :
Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , he shall see it , and to him will I giue the land that he hath troden vpon , and to his children , because hee hath wholly followed the Lord .
Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , saying , Thou also shalt not goe in thither .
But Ioshua the sonne of Nun , which standeth before thee , he shall goe in thither . Encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherite it .
Moreouer , your litle ones , which ye said should be a pray , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge betweene good and euil , they shall goe in thither ; and vnto them will I giue it , and they shall possesse it .
But as for you , turne ye , and take your iourney into the wildernesse , by the way of the Red sea .
Then ye answered , and said vnto mee , Wee haue sinned against the Lord , we will goe vp and fight , according to all that the Lord our God commanded vs . And when ye had girded on euery man his weapons of warre , yee were ready to goe vp into the hill .
And the Lord said vnto me , Say vnto them , Goe not vp , neither fight , for I am not among you : least ye be smitten before your enemies .
So I spake vnto you , and you would not heare , but rebelled against the commandement of the Lord , and went presumptuously vp into the hill .
And the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine , came out against you , and chased you , as Bees doe , and destroyed you in Seir , euen vnto Hormah .
And ye returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord would not hearken to your voyce , nor giue eare vnto you .
<NON-VERSE>
Then we turned , and tooke our iourney into the wildernesse , by the way of the Red sea , as the Lord spake vnto mee : and wee compassed mount Seir many dayes .
And the Lord spake vnto me , saying ,
Yee haue compassed this mountaine long enough : turne you Northward .
And commaund thou the people , saying , Ye are to passe through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir , and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed vnto your selues therefore .
Meddle not with them , for I will not giue you of their land , no not so much as a foote breadth , because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau for a possession .
Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat , and yee shall also buy water of them for money , that yee may drinke .
For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee , in all the workes of thy hand : hee knoweth thy walking thorow this great wildernesse : these fourtie yeres the Lord thy God hath bene with thee , thou hast lacked nothing .
And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , thorow the way of the plaine from Elath , and from Ezion - Gaber , wee turned and passed by the way of the wildernesse of Moab .
And the Lord said vnto mee , Distresse not the Moabites , neither contend with them in battell : for I wil not giue thee of their land for a possession , because I haue giuen Ar vnto the children of Lot for a possession .
The Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims :
Which also were accounted giants , as the Anakims , but the Moabites call them Emims .
The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime , but the children of Esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them , & dwelt in their stead , as Israel did vnto the land of his possession , which the Lord gaue vnto them .
Now rise vp , said I , and get you ouer the brooke Zered : and we went ouer the brooke Zered .
And the space in which we came from Kadesh Barnea , vntill we were come ouer the brooke Zered , was thirtie and eight yeeres ; vntill all the generation of the men of warre were wasted out from among the hoste , as the Lord sware vnto them . For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from among the hoste , vntill they were consumed .
¶ So it came to passe , when all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people ,
That the Lord spake vnto me , saying ,
Thou art to passe ouer thorow Ar , the coast of Moab , this day .
And when thou commest nigh ouer against the children of Ammon , distresse them not , nor meddle with them : for I will not giue thee of the lande of the children of Ammon any possession , because I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot for a possession :
( That also was accounted a land of Giants : giants dwelt therein in old time , and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims .
A people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims : but the Lord destroyed them before them , and they succeeded them & dwelt in their stead : )
As he did to the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir , when he destroyed the Horims from before them , and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead euen vnto this day .
And the Auims which dwelt in Hazerim , euen vnto Azzah , the Caphtorims which came foorth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead .
¶ Rise ye vp , take your iourney , and passe ouer the riuer Arnon : Behold , I haue giuen into thy hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possesse it , and contend with him in battell .
This day will I begin to put the dread of thee , and the feare of thee vpon the nations , that are vnder the whole heauen , who shall heare report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
¶ And I sent messengers out of the wildernesse of Kedemoth , vnto Sihon king of Heshbon , with wordes of peace , saying ,
Let me passe through thy land : I will goe along by the high way , I will neither turne vnto the right hand , nor to the left .
Thou shalt sell me meat for money , that I may eate , and giue me water for money that I may drinke : Only I will passe through on my feet :
As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir , and the Moabites which dwell in Ar , did vnto me , vntill I shall passe ouer Iordan , into the land which the Lord our God giueth vs .
But Sihon King of Heshbon would not let vs passe by him : for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that hee might deliuer him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
And the Lord said vnto mee , Behold , I haue begun to giue Sihon and his land before thee : begin to possesse , that thou mayest inherit his land .
Then Sihon came out against vs , he & all his people to fight at Iahaz .
And the Lord our God deliuered him before vs , and wee smote him , and his sonnes , and all his people .
And we tooke all his cities at that time , and vtterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the litle ones of euery citie , we left none to remaine :
Onely the cattell wee tooke for a pray vnto our selues , and the spoyle of the cities , which we tooke :
From Aroer , which is by the brinke of the riuer of Arnon , and from the citie that is by the riuer euen vnto Gilead , there was not one citie too strong for vs : the Lord our God deliuered all vnto vs .
<NON-VERSE>
Then we turned , and went vp the way to Bashan : and Og the King of Bashan came out against vs , hee , and all his people to battell at Edrei .
And the Lord said vnto mee , Feare him not : for I will deliuer him , and all his people , and his land into thy hand , and thou shalt doe vnto him as thou didst vnto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
So the Lord our God deliuered into our hands Og also the King of Bashan , and all his people : and wee smote him vntill none was left to him remayning .
And we tooke all his cities at that time , there was not a citie which wee tooke not from them ; threescore cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdome of Og in Bashan .
All these cities were fenced with high walles , gates and barres , beside vnwalled townes a great many .
And we vtterly destroyed them , as we did vnto Sihon King of Heshbon , vtterly destroying the men , women , and children of euery citie .
But all the cattell , and the spoile of the cities , we tooke for a pray to our selues .
And we tooke at that time out of the hand of the two Kings of the Amorites , the land that was on this side Iordan , from the riuer of Arnon , vnto mount Hermon :
( Which Hermon the Sidonians call Syrion : and the Amorites call it Shenir . )
All the cities of the plaine , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , vnto Salchah , and Edrei , cities of the kingdome of Og in Bashan .
For onely Og King of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedsted was a bedsted of yron : is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon ? Nine cubites was the length thereof , and foure cubites the breadth of it , after the cubite of a man .
And this land which we possessed at that time , from Aroer which is by the riuer Arnon , and halfe mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gaue I vnto the Reubenites , and to the Gadites .
And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdome of Og , gaue I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh : All the region of Argob with all Bashan , which was called the land of Giants .
Iair the sonne of Manasseh tooke all the countrey of Argob , vnto the coastes of Geshuri , and Maachathi ; and called them after his owne name , Bashan Hauoth Iair , vnto this day .
And I gaue Gilead vnto Machir .
And vnto the Reubenites , and vnto the Gadites , I gaue from Gilead , euen vnto the riuer Arnon , halfe the valley , and the border , euen vnto the riuer Iabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon :
The plaine also , and Iordan , and the coast thereof , from Chinnereth , euen vnto the sea of the plaine , euen the salt sea , vnder Ashdoth Pisgah Eastward .
¶ And I commanded you at that time , saying , The Lord your God hath giuen you this land to possesse it : ye shall passe ouer armed before your brethren the children of Israel , all that are meet for the warre .
But your wiues , and your little ones , and your cattell ( for I know that ye haue much cattel ) shall abide in your cities , which I haue giuen you :
Untill the Lord haue giuen rest vnto your brethren , as well as vnto you , and vntill they also possesse the land which the Lord your God hath giuen them beyond Iordan : and then shall ye returne euery man vnto his possession , which I haue giuen you .
¶ And I commanded Ioshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes haue seene all that the Lord your God hath done vnto these two Kings : so shal the Lord doe vnto all the kingdomes whither thou passest .
Ye shall not feare them : for the Lord your God , he shal fight for you .
And I besought the Lord at that time , saying ,
O Lord God , thou hast begun to shew thy seruant thy greatnesse , and thy mighty hand : for what God is there in heauen , or in earth , that can do according to thy workes , and according to thy might ?
I pray thee let me goe ouer , and see the good land that is beyond Iordan , that goodly mountaine and Lebanon .
But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not heare mee : and the Lord said vnto me , Let it suffice thee , speake no more vnto me of this matter .
Get thee vp into the top of Pisgah , and lift vp thine eyes Westward , and Northward , and Southward , and Eastward , and beholde it with thine eyes : for thou shalt not goe ouer this Iordan .
But charge Ioshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for hee shall goe ouer before this people , and he shall cause them to inherite the land which thou shalt see .
<NON-VERSE>
Nowe therefore hearken , O Israel , vnto the Statutes , and vnto the Iudgments which I teach you , for to do them , that ye may liue , and goe in and possesse the lande , which the Lord God of your fathers giueth you .
Ye shall not adde vnto the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish ought from it , that ye may keepe the Commaundements of the Lord your God , which I command you .
Your eyes haue seene what the Lord did because of Baal Peor : for all the men that followed Baal Peor , the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you .
But yee that did cleaue vnto the Lord your God , are aliue euery one of you this day .
Behold , I haue taught you Statutes , and Iudgements , euen as the Lord my God commanded me , that ye should do so , in the land whither ye goe to possesse it .
Keepe therefore , and doe them ; for this is your wisedome and your vnderstanding in the sight of the nations , which shall heare all these statutes , and say , Surely this great nation is a wise and vnderstanding people .
For what nation is there so great , who hath God so nigh vnto them , as the Lord our God is in all things , that we call vpon him for ?
And what nation is there so great , that hath Statutes and Iudgements so righteous , as all this Law which I set before you this day ?
Onely take heed to thy selfe , and keepe thy soule diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes haue seene , and lest they depart from thy heart all the dayes of thy life : but teach them thy sonnes , & thy sonnes sonnes :
Specially , the day that thou stoodst before the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the Lord said vnto mee , Gather me the people together , and I will make them heare my wordes , that they may learne to feare mee all the dayes that they shall liue vpon the earth , and that they may teach their children .
And ye came neere and stood vnder the mountaine , and the mountaine burnt with fire vnto the midst of heauen , with darkenes , cloudes , and thicke darkenesse .
And the Lord spake vnto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voyce of the words , but saw no similitude , onely ye heard a voyce .
And he declared vnto you his couenant , which he commanded you to performe , euen ten commandements , and he wrote them vpon two tables of stone .
¶ And the Lord commanded me at that time , to teach you Statutes , and Iudgements , that yee might doe them in the land whither ye goe ouer to possesse it .
Take ye therfore good heed vnto your selues , ( for ye saw no maner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake vnto you in Horeb , out of the midst of the fire )
The likenesse of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likenesse of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth :
And lest thou lift vp thine eyes vnto heauen , and when thou seest the sun , and the moone , and the starres , euen all the hoste of heauen , shouldest be driuen to worship them , and serue them , which the Lord thy God hath diuided vnto all nations vnder the whole heauen .
But the Lord hath taken you , and brought you foorth out of the yron fornace , euen out of Egypt , to bee vnto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
Furthermore , the Lord was angry with mee for your sakes , and sware that I should not goe ouer Iordan , and that I should not goe in vnto that good land which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance .
But I must die in this lande , I must not goe ouer Iordan : but ye shall goe ouer and possesse that good land .
Take heed vnto your selues , lest ye forget the couenant of the Lord your God , which hee made with you , and make you a grauen image , or the likenes of any thing which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee .
For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire , euen a iealous God .
¶ When thou shalt beget children , and childrens children , and shalt haue remained long in the land , and shal corrupt your selues , & make a grauen image , or the likenes of any thing , and shall doe euil in the sight of the Lord thy God , to prouoke him to anger :
I call heauen and earth to witnesse against you this day , that ye shall soone vtterly perish from off the land whereunto you goe ouer Iordan , to possesse it : yee shall not prolong your dayes vpon it , but shall vtterly bee destroyed .
And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the Lord shall lead you .
And there ye shall serue gods , the worke of mens hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor heare , nor eate , nor smell .
But if from thence thou shalt seeke the Lord thy God , thou shalt finde him , if thou seeke him with all thy heart , and with all thy soule .
When thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come vpon thee , euen in the latter dayes , if thou turne to the Lord thy God , and shalt be obedient vnto his voice :
( For the Lord thy God is a mercifull God ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the couenant of thy fathers , which he sware vnto them .
For aske now of the dayes that are past , which were before thee , since the day that God created man vpon earth , and aske from the one side of heauen vnto the other , whether there hath bene any such thing as this great thing is , or hath bene heard like it ?
Did euer people heare the voyce of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and liue ?
Or hath God assayed to goe and take him a nation from the midst of another nation , by temptations , by signes , and by wonders , and by warre , and by a mighty hand , and by a stretehed out arme , and by great terrors , according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes ?
Unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know , that the Lord hee is God ; there is none else besides him .
Out of heauen hee made thee to heare his voice , that he might instruct thee : and vpon earth hee shewed thee his great fire , and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
And because he loued thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mightie power out of Egypt :
To driue out nations from before thee , greater and mightier then thou art , to bring thee in , to giue thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
Know therefore this day , & consider it in thine heart , that the Lord hee is God in heauen aboue , and vpon the earth beneath : there is none else .
Thou shalt keepe therefore his Statutes , and his Commandements , which I command thee this day ; that it may goe well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy dayes vpon the earth , which the Lord thy God giueth thee , for euer .
¶ Then Moses seuered three cities on this side Iordan , toward the Sunne rising :
That the slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour vnawares , and hated him not in times past , and that fleeing vnto one of these cities he might liue :
Namely , Bezer in the wildernesse , in the plaine countrey of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
¶ And this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel :
These are the Testimonies , and the Statutes , and the Iudgements , which Moses spake vnto the children of Israel , after they came foorth out of Egypt ;
On this side Iordan in the valley ouer against Beth - Peor , in the land of Sihon King of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote , after they were come foorth out of Egypt .
And they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Iordan toward the sun rising ,
From Aroer , which is by the banke of the riuer Arnon , euen vnto mount Sion , which is Hermon ,
<NON-VERSE>
And Moses called all Israel , and sayd vnto them , Heare , O Israel , the Statutes and Iudgements which I speake in your eares this day , that ye may learne them , and keepe and doe them .
The Lord our God made a couenant with vs in Horeb .
The Lord made not this couenant with our fathers , but with vs : euen vs , who are all of vs here aliue this day .
The Lord talked with you , face to face , in the mount , out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood betweene the Lord and you , at that time , to shew you the word of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not vp into the mount , ) saying ,
¶ I am the Lord thy God , which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
Thou shalt haue none other gods before me .
Thou shalt not make thee any grauen image , or any likenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth .
Thou shalt not bow downe thy selfe vnto them , nor serue them : for I the Lord thy God am a ielous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers vpon the children , vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
And shewing mercy vnto thousands , of them that loue me , and keepe my commandements .
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine : for the Lord will not holde him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine .
Keepe the Sabbath day to sanctifie it , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee .
Sixe dayes thou shalt labour , and doe all thy worke .
But the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou shalt not doe any worke , thou , nor thy sonne , nor thy daughter , nor thy man seruant , nor thy maid seruant , nor thine oxe , nor thine asse , nor any of thy cattel , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates , that thy man seruant and thy maid seruant may rest as well as thou .
And remember that thou wast a seruant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence , through a mightie hand , and by a stretched out arme : Therefore the Lord thy God commaunded thee to keepe the Sabbath day .
¶ Honour thy father and thy mother , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee , that thy daies may be prolonged , and that it may goe well with thee , in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee . Thou shalt not kill .
Neither shalt thou commit adulterie . Neither shalt thou steale .
Neither shalt thou beare false witnesse against thy neighbour .
Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife , neither shalt thou couet thy neighbours house , his field , or his man seruant , or his maide seruant , his oxe , or his asse , or any thing that is thy neighbours .
¶ These wordes the Lord spake vnto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thicke darkenesse , with a great voice , and he added no more , and he wrote them in two Tables of stone , and deliuered them vnto me .
And it came to passe when yee heard the voice out of the midst of the darkenes ( for the mountaine did burne with fire ) that ye came neere vnto mee , euen all the heads of your tribes , and your elders .
And ye said , Behold , the Lord our God hath shewed vs his glory , and his greatnesse , and we haue heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : wee haue seene this day that God doth talke with man , and he liueth .
Now therefore why should wee die ? for this great fire will consume vs . If we heare the voyce of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the liuing God , speaking out of the midst of the fire ( as we haue ) and liued ?
Goe thou neere , and heare all that the Lord our God shall say ; and speake thou vnto vs all that the Lord our God shall speake vnto thee , and we will heare it , and doe it .
And the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye spake vnto me , and the Lord said vnto me , I haue heard the voice of the wordes of this people , which they haue spoken vnto thee : they haue well said , all that they haue spoken .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would feare me , and keepe my commandements alwayes , that it might bee well with them , and with their children for euer .
Goe , say to them , Get you into your tents againe .
But as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speake vnto thee all the Commandements , and the Statutes , and the Iudgements , which thou shalt teach them , that they may doe them in the land which I giue them to possesse it .
Ye shall obserue to doe therefore , as the Lord your God hath commanded you : you shall not turne aside to the right hand , or to the left .
<NON-VERSE>
Now these are the Commaundements , the Statutes , & the Iudgements , which the Lord your God commanded to teach you , that ye might doe them in the land whither ye goe to possesse it :
That thou mightest feare the Lord thy God , to keepe all his Statutes , and his Commandements which I command thee ; thou , and thy sonne , and thy sonnes sonne , all the dayes of thy life : and that thy dayes may be prolonged .
¶ Heare therefore , O Israel , and obserue to do it , that it may be wel with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milke and hony .
Heare , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord .
And thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soule , and with all thy might .
And these words which I command thee this day , shall bee in thine heart .
And thou shalt teach them diligently vnto thy children , and shalt talke of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest downe , and when thou risest vp .
And thou shalt binde them for a signe vpon thine hand , and they shalbe as frontlets betweene thine eyes .
And thou shalt write them vpon the posts of thy house , and on thy gates .
And it shall be when the Lord thy God shall haue brought thee into the land which hee sware vnto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Iacob to giue thee , great and goodly cities , which thou buildedst not ,
And houses full of all good things which thou filledst not , and welles digged which thou diggedst not , vineyards and oliue trees which thou plantedst not , when thou shalt haue eaten and be full ,
Then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God , and serue him , & shalt sweare by his Name .
Yee shall not goe after other gods , of the gods of the people which are round about you :
( For the Lord thy God is a ielous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord thy God bee kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
¶ Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God , as yee tempted him in Massah .
You shall diligently keepe the Commandements of the Lord your God , and his Testimonies , and his Statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
And thou shalt doe that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest goe in , and possesse the good land which the Lord sware vnto thy fathers :
To cast out all thine enemies from before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
And when thy sonne asketh thee in time to come , saying , What meane the Testimonies , & the Statutes , and the Iudgements , which the Lord our God hath commanded you ?
Then thou shalt say vnto thy sonne , We were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt , and the Lord brought vs out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
And the Lord shewed signes and wonders , great and sore vpon Egypt , vpon Pharaoh , and vpon all his houshold , before our eyes :
And hee brought vs out from thence , that hee might bring vs in , to giue vs the land which hee sware vnto our fathers .
And the Lord commanded vs to doe all these Statutes , to feare the Lord our God , for our good alwayes , that he might preserue vs aliue , as it is at this day .
<NON-VERSE>
When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possesse it , and hath cast out many nations before thee , the Hittites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , and the Hiuites , and the Iebusites , seuen nations greater and mightier then thou :
And when the Lord thy God shall deliuer them before thee , thou shalt smite them , and vtterly destroy them , thou shalt make no couenant with them , nor shew mercy vnto them .
Neither shalt thou make marriages with them : thy daughter thou shalt not giue vnto his sonne , nor his daughter shalt thou take vnto thy sonne .
For they will turne away thy sonne from following mee , that they may serue other gods : so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
But thus shal ye deale with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and breake downe their images , and cut downe their groues , and burne their grauen images with fire .
For thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God : the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people vnto himselfe , aboue all people that are vpon the face of the earth .
The Lord did not set his loue vpon you , nor choose you , because yee were moe in number then any people : ( for ye were the fewest of all people , )
But because the Lord loued you , and because hee would keepe the othe which hee had sworne vnto your fathers , hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
Know therefore that the Lord thy God , he is God , the faithfull God , which keepeth Couenant and Mercy with them that loue him , and keepe his Commandements , to a thousand generations ;
And repaieth them that hate him to their face , to destroy them : he wil not be slacke to him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
Thou shalt therefore keepe the Commandements , and the Statutes , and the Iudgements , which I command thee this day , to doe them .
¶ Wherefore it shal come to passe , if ye hearken to these iudgements , and keepe and do them : That the Lord thy God shall keepe vnto thee the Couenant and the Mercy which he sware vnto thy fathers .
And hee will loue thee , and blesse thee , and multiply thee : Hee will also blesse the fruit of thy wombe , and the fruit of thy land , thy corne , and thy wine , and thine oile , the encrease of thy kine , and the flockes of thy sheepe , in the land which hee sware vnto thy fathers to giue thee .
Thou shalt bee blessed aboue all people : there shall not bee male or female barren among you or among your cattell .
And the Lord will take away from thee all sickenesse , and will put none of the euill diseases of Egypt ( which thou knowest ) vpon thee : but will lay them vpon all them that hate thee .
And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliuer thee : thine eye shall haue no pitie vpon them , neither shalt thou serue their gods , for that will be a snare vnto thee .
If thou shalt say in thine heart , These nations are moe then I , howe can I dispossesse them ?
Thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember , what the Lord thy God did vnto Pharaoh , and vnto all Egypt ,
The great temptations which thine eyes sawe , and the signes and the wonders , and the mightie hand , and the stretched out arme , whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out : so shall the Lord thy God doe vnto all the people of whom thou art afraid .
Moreouer , the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them , vntill they that are left and hide themselues from thee , be destroyed .
Thou shalt not bee affrighted at them : for the Lord thy God is among you , a mightie God , and terrible .
And the Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee by litle and litle : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beastes of the field increase vpon thee .
But the Lord thy God shall deliuer them vnto thee , and shall destroy them with a mightie destruction , vntill they be destroyed .
And he shall deliuer their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from vnder heauen : There shal no man be able to stand before thee , vntil thou haue destroyed them .
The grauen images of their gods shall yee burne with fire : thou shalt not desire the siluer or golde that is on them , nor take it vnto thee , lest thou bee snared therein : for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God .
<NON-VERSE>
All the commaundements which I commaund thee this day , shall yee obserue to doe , that yee may liue , and multiply , and goe in , and possesse the land which the Lord sware vnto your fathers .
And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these fourtie yeeres in the wildernesse , to humble thee , and to proue thee , to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keepe his commandements , or no .
And he humbled thee , and suffred thee to hunger , and fed thee with Manna , which thou knewest not , neither did thy fathers know : that he might make thee know , that man doth not liue by bread onely , but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man liue .
Thy raiment waxed not old vpon thee , neither did thy foote swell these fourtie yeeres .
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that as a man chasteneth his son , so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee .
Therefore thou shalt keepe the Commandements of the Lord thy God , to walke in his wayes , and to feare him .
For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land , a lande of brookes of water , of fountaines , and depths that spring out of valleys and hilles ,
A land of wheate , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranats , a land of oyle oliue , and hony ,
A lande wherein thou shalt eate bread without scarcenes , thou shalt not lacke any thing in it : a lande whose stones are yron , and out of whose hils thou mayest digge brasse .
When thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt blesse the Lord thy God , for the good lande which hee hath giuen thee .
Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God , in not keeping his Commandements , and his Iudgements , and his Statutes which I command thee this day :
Lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
And when thy heards and thy flocks multiply , and thy siluer and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied :
Then thine heart bee lifted vp , and thou forget the Lord thy God ( which brought thee foorth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage ,
Who led thee through that great and terrible wildernesse , wherein were fierie serpents , and scorpions , & drought , where there was no water , who brought thee foorth water out of the rocke of flint ,
Who fed thee in the wildernesse with Manna , which thy fathers knew not , that hee might humble thee , and that hee might prooue thee , to doe thee good at thy latter end : )
And thou say in thine heart , My power , and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth .
But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God : for it is he that giueth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his Couenant , which he sware vnto thy fathers , as it is this day .
And it shalbe , if thou doe at all forget the Lord thy God , and walke after other gods , and serue them , and worship them ; I testifie against you this day , that ye shall surely perish .
<NON-VERSE>
Heare , O Israel , thou art to passe ouer Iordan this day , to goe in , to possesse nations greater & mightier then thy selfe , Cities great , and fenced vp to heauen ,
A people great and tall , the children of the Anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of Anak ?
Understand therefore this day , that the Lord thy God is he , which goeth ouer before thee , as a consuming fire : he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them downe before thy face : So shalt thou driue them out , and destroy them quickly , as the Lord hath said vnto thee .
Speake not thou in thine heart , after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out from before thee , saying , For my righteousnesse the Lord hath brought mee in to possesse this land : but for the wickednesse of these nations , the Lord doeth driue them out from before thee .
Not for thy righteousnesse , or for the vprightnesse of thine heart , doest thou goe to possesse their land : But for the wickednesse of these nations the Lord thy God doeth driue them out from before thee , and that he may performe the word which the Lord sware vnto thy fathers , Abraham , Isaac and Iacob .
Understand therefore , that the Lord thy God giueth thee not this good land to possesse it , for thy righteousnesse ; for thou art a stiffe - necked people .
¶ Remember and forget not , how thou prouokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wildernesse : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , vntill ye came vnto this place , yee haue bene rebellious against the Lord .
Also in Horeb yee prouoked the Lord to wrath , so that the Lord was angry with you , to haue destroyed you .
When I was gone vp into the mount , to receiue the Tables of stone , euen the Tables of the Couenant which the Lord made with you , then I abode in the mount fortie dayes , and fortie nights , I neither did eate bread , nor drinke water :
And the Lord deliuered vnto me two Tables of stone , written with the finger of God , and on them was written according to all the words which the Lord spake with you in the mount , out of the midst of fire , in the day of the assembly .
And it came to passe at the end of fortie dayes , and fortie nights , that the Lord gaue mee the two Tables of stone , euen the Tables of the Couenant .
And the Lord said vnto mee , Arise , get thee downe quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought foorth out of Egypt , haue corrupted themselues : they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they haue made them a molten image .
Furthermore , the Lord spake vnto me , saying , I haue seene this people , and behold , it is a stifnecked people .
Let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from vnder heauen : and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater then they .
So I turned and came downe from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two Tables of the Couenant were in my two hands .
And I looked , and behold , ye had sinned against the Lord your God , and had made you a molten calfe : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you .
And I tooke the two Tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
And I fell downe before the Lord , as at the first , fortie dayes and fortie nights , I did neither eate bread nor drinke water , because of all your sinnes which ye sinned , in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord , to prouoke him to anger .
( For I was afraid of the anger , and whot displeasure wherewith the Lord was wroth against you , to destroy you . ) But the Lord hearkned vnto me at that time also .
And the Lord was very angry with Aaron , to haue destroyed him : And I prayed for Aaron also the same time .
And I tooke your sinne , the calfe which ye had made , and burnt it with fire , and stamped it , and ground it very small , euen vntill it was as small as dust : and I cast the dust therof into the brooke that descended out of the mount .
And at Taberah , and at Massah , and at Kibroth - Hattaauah , ye prouoked the Lord to wrath .
Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea , saying , Goe vp and possesse the land which I haue giuen you , then you rebelled against the commandement of the Lord your God , and ye beleeued him not , nor hearkened to his voyce .
You haue bin rebellious against the Lord , from the day that I knew you .
Thus I fell downe before the Lord fourtie dayes , and fourtie nights , as I fel downe at the first , because the Lord had said , he would destroy you .
I prayed therefore vnto the Lord , and said , O Lord God , destroy not thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatnes , which thou hast brought foorth out of Egypt , with a mightie hand .
Remember thy seruants , Abraham , Isaac , and Iacob , looke not vnto the stubburnnesse of this people , nor to their wickednes , nor to their sinne :
Lest the land whence thou broughtest vs out , say , Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which hee promised them , and because hee hated them , hee hath brought them out , to slay them in the wildernesse .
<NON-VERSE>
At that time the Lord said vnto me , Hew thee two Tables of stone , like vnto the first , and come vp vnto mee into the mount , and make thee an Arke of wood .
And I will write on the Tables the words that were in the first Tables which thou brakest , and thou shalt put them in the Arke .
And I made an Arke of Shittim wood , and hewed two Tables of stone like vnto the first , and went vp into the mount , hauing the two Tables in mine hand .
And he wrote on the Tables , according to the first writing , the tenne Commandements , which the Lord spake vnto you in the mount , out of the midst of the fire , in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gaue them vnto me .
And I turned my selfe and came downe from the mount , and put the Tables in the Arke which I had made , and there they be , as the Lord commanded me .
¶ And the children of Israel tooke their iourney from Beeroth , of the children of Iaakan , to Mosera ; there Aaron died , and there he was buried , and Eleazar his sonne ministred in the Priests office in his stead .
From thence they iourneyed vnto Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Iotbath , a land of riuers of waters .
¶ At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Leui , to beare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord , to minister vnto him , and to blesse in his Name , vnto this day .
Wherefore Leui hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren : the Lord is his inheritance , according as the Lord thy God promised him .
And I stayed in the mount , according to the first time , fortie dayes , and fortie nights : and the Lord hearkened vnto mee at that time also , and the Lord would not destroy thee .
And the Lord said vnto me , Arise , take thy iourney before the people , that they may goe in , and possesse the land which I sware vnto their fathers to giue vnto them .
¶ And now Israel , what doeth the Lord thy God require of thee , but to feare the Lord thy God , to walke in all his waies , and to loue him , and to serue the Lord thy God , with all thy heart , and with all thy soule ,
To keepe the Commandements of the Lord , and his Statutes , which I commaund thee this day for thy good ?
Behold , the heauen , & the heauen of heauens is the Lords thy God , the earth also , with all that therein is .
Onely the Lord had a delight in thy fathers , to loue them , and hee chose their seed after them , euen you , aboue all people , as it is this day .
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and bee no more stiffenecked .
For the Lord your God is God of gods , and Lord of lords , a great God , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not persons , nor taketh reward .
He doeth execute the iudgement of the fatherlesse , and widow , and loueth the stranger , in giuing him food and raiment .
Loue yee therefore the stranger : for yee were strangers in the land of Egypt .
Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God ; him shalt thou serue , and to him shalt thou cleaue , and sweare by his Name .
He is thy praise , and he is thy God that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes haue seene .
<NON-VERSE>
Therefore thou shalt loue the Lord thy God , and keepe his charge , and his Statutes , and his Iudgements , and his Commandements alway .
And know you this day : for I speake not with your children which haue not knowen , and which haue not seene the chastisement of the Lord your God , his greatnesse , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arme ,
And his miracles , and his actes , which he did in the midst of Egypt , vnto Pharaoh the King of Egypt , and vnto all his land ,
And what hee did vnto the army of Egypt , vnto their horses , and to their charets , how he made the water of the Red sea to ouerflow them as they pursued after you , and how the Lord hath destroyed them vnto this day ,
And what hee did vnto you in the wildernesse , vntill yee came into this place ,
And what he did vnto Dathan , and Abiram , the sonnes of Eliab the sonne of Reuben : how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them vp , and their housholds , and their tents , and all the substance that was in their possession in the middest of all Israel .
But your eyes haue seene all the great acts of the Lord , which he did .
Therefore shall yee keepe all the Commandements which I command you this day , that ye may be strong and goe in , and possesse the land whither ye goe to possesse it :
And that yee may prolong your dayes in the lande which the Lord sware vnto your fathers to giue vnto them , and to their seed , a land that floweth with milke and hony .
¶ For the land whither thou goest in to possesse it , is not as the lande of Egypt from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbes :
But the lande whither ye goe to possesse it , is a lande of hilles and valleys , and drinketh water of the raine of heauen :
A lande , which the Lord thy God careth for : the eyes of the Lord thy God are alwayes vpon it , from the beginning of the yeere , euen vnto the end of the yeere .
¶ And it shall come to passe , if you shall hearken diligently vnto my Commandements which I command you this day , to loue the Lord your God , and to serue him with all your heart , and with all your soule ;
That I will giue you the raine of your land in his due season , the first raine and the latter raine , that thou mayest gather in thy corne , and thy wine , and thine oyle .
And I will send grasse in thy fields for thy cattell , that thou mayest eate and be full .
Take heede to your selues , that your heart be not deceiued , and ye turne aside , and serue other gods , and worship them :
And then the Lords wrath be kindled against you , and hee shut vp the heauen , that there be no raine , and that the land yeeld not her fruit , and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giueth you .
¶ Therefore shall ye lay vp these my words in your heart , and in your soule , and bind them for a signe vpon your hand , that they may bee as frontlets betweene your eyes .
And ye shal teach them your children , speaking of them , when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest downe , and when thou risest vp .
And thou shalt write them vpon the doore posts of thine house , and vpon thy gates :
That your dayes may bee multiplied , and the dayes of your children , in the land which the Lord sware vnto your fathers to giue them , as the dayes of heauen vpon the earth .
¶ For if ye shall diligently keepe all these Commaundements which I command you , to doe them , to loue the Lord your God , to walke in all his wayes , and to cleaue vnto him :
Then will the Lord driue out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possesse greater nations , and mightier then your selues .
Euery place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread , shall be yours : from the wildernesse , and Lebanon , from the riuer , the riuer Euphrates , euen vnto the vttermost sea , shall your coast be .
There shall no man bee able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the feare of you , and the dread of you vpon all the land that yee shall tread vpon , as hee hath said vnto you .
¶ Behold , I set before you this day , a blessing and a curse :
A blessing , if ye obey the Commandements of the Lord your God which I command you this day :
And a curse , if ye will not obey the Commandements of the Lord your God , but turne aside out of the way , which I command you this day , to goe after other gods which yee haue not knowen .
And it shall come to passe when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in , vnto the land whither thou goest to possesse it , that thou shalt put the blessing vpon mount Gerizim , and the curse vpon mount Ebal .
Are they not on the other side Iordan , by the way where the Sunne goeth downe , in the land of the Canaanites , which dwell in the champion ouer against Gilgal , beside the plaines of Moreh ?
For ye shall passe ouer Iordan , to goe in to possesse the land which the Lord your God giueth you , and ye shall possesse it , and dwell therein .
<NON-VERSE>
These are the Statutes , and Iudgements , which ye shal obserue to do , in the land which the Lord God of thy fathers giueth thee to possesse it , all the dayes that yee liue vpon the earth .
Yee shall vtterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which yee shall possesse , serued their gods , vpon the high mountaines , and vpon the hils , and vnder euery greene tree .
And you shall ouerthrow their altars , and breake their pillars , and burne their groues with fire , and you shall hew downe the grauen images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
Yee shall not doe so vnto the Lord your God .
But vnto the place which the Lord your God shall chuse out of all your tribes , to put his name there , euen vnto his habitation shall yee seeke , and thither thou shalt come :
And thither yee shall bring your burnt offrings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heaue offrings of your hand , and your vowes , and your free wil offerings , and the firstlings of your heards , and of your flocks .
And there ye shall eate before the Lord your God , and yee shall reioyce in all that you put your hand vnto , ye and your housholds , wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee .
Ye shall not do after all the things that we doe here this day , euery man whatsoeuer is right in his owne eyes .
For yee are not as yet come to the rest , and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giueth you .
But when yee goe ouer Iordan , and dwel in the land which the Lord your God giueth you to inherite , and when he giueth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety :
Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there , thither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heaue offring of your hand , & all your choice vowes , which ye vow vnto the Lord .
And yee shall reioyce before the Lord your God , ye and your sonnes and your daughters , and your men seruants , and your maid seruants , and the Leuite that is within your gates , forasmuch as hee hath no part nor inheritance with you .
Take heed to thy selfe , that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in euery place that thou seest :
But in the place which the Lord shal choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
Notwithstanding , thou mayest kill and eate flesh in all thy gates , whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after , according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath giuen thee : the vncleane and the cleane may eate thereof , as of the Roe bucke , and as of the Hart .
Onely ye shall not eat the blood : yee shall powre it vpon the earth as water .
¶ Thou mayest not eate within thy gates the tithe of thy corne , or of thy wine , or of thy oyle , or the firstlings of thy heards , or of thy flocke , nor any of thy vowes which thou vowest , nor thy free will offerings , or heaue offering of thine hand :
But thou must eate them before the Lord thy God , in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , thou and thy sonne , and thy daughter , and thy man seruant , and thy maid seruant , and the Leuite that is within thy gates : and thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God , in all that thou puttest thine hands vnto .
Take heed to thy selfe , that thou forsake not the Leuite , as long as thou liuest vpon the earth . ¶ When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy border , as hee hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , I will eate flesh ( because thy soule longeth to eat flesh ) thou mayest eat flesh whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after .
If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put his Name there , be too farre from thee , then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flocke , which the Lord hath giuen thee , as I haue commaunded thee , and thou shalt eate in thy gates , whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after .
Euen as the Roe bucke and the Hart is eaten , so thou shalt eate them : the vncleane and the cleane shall eate of them alike .
Onely be sure that thou eate not the blood : for the blood is the life , and thou mayest not eate the life with the flesh .
Thou shalt not eate it ; thou shalt powre it vpon the earth as water .
Thou shalt not eate it , that it may goe well with thee , and with thy children after thee , when thou shalt doe that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
Onely thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vowes , thou shalt take , and goe vnto the place which the Lord shall chuse .
And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , vpon the altar of the Lord thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be powred out vpon the altar of the Lord thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
Obserue & heare all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for euer , when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God .
¶ When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possesse them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land :
Take heede to thy selfe that thou be not snared by following them , after that they be destroyed from before thee , and that thou enquire not after their gods , saying , How did these nations serue their gods ? euen so will I doe likewise .
Thou shalt not doe so vnto the Lord thy God : for euery abomination to the Lord which hee hateth , haue they done vnto their gods : for euen their sonnes and their daughters they haue burnt in the fire to their gods .
And the signe or the wonder come to passe , wherof he spake vnto thee , saying , Let vs go after other gods ( which thou hast not knowen ) and let vs serue them :
Thou shalt not hearken vnto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreames : for the Lord your God prooueth you , to know whether you loue the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soule .
Ye shall walke after the Lord your God , and feare him , and keepe his commandements , and obey his voyce , and you shall serue him , and cleaue vnto him .
Namely of the gods of the people which are round about you , nigh vnto thee , or farre off from thee , from the one end of the earth , euen vnto the other end of the earth :
Thou shalt not consent vnto him nor hearken vnto him , neither shall thine eye pitie him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceale him . But thou shalt surely kill him : Thine hand shall be first vpon him , to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
And thou shalt stone him with stones , that hee die : because hee hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
And all Israel shall heare , and feare , and shall doe no more any such wickednesse as this is , among you .
¶ If thou shalt heare say in one of thy cities , which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee to dwell there , saying ,
Certaine men , the children of Belial , are gone out from among you , and haue withdrawen the inhabitants of their citie , saying , Let vs goe & serue other gods , which ye haue not knowen :
Then shalt thou enquire and make search , and aske diligently : and behold , if it be trueth , and the thing certaine , that such abomination is wrought among you :
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that citie with the edge of the sword , destroying it vtterly , and all that is therein , and the cattell thereof , with the edge of the sword .
And thou shalt gather all the spoile of it , into the midst of the street thereof , and shalt burne with fire the citie , and all the spoile thereof euery whit , for the Lord thy God : and it shall be an heape for euer , it shall not bee built againe .
And there shall cleaue nought of the cursed thing to thine hand , that the Lord may turne from the fiercenesse of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and haue compassion vpon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers ;
<NON-VERSE>
Yee are the children of the Lord your God : yee shall not cutte your selues , nor make any baldnesse betweene your eyes for the dead .
For thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God , and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people vnto himselfe , aboue all the nations that are vpon the earth . ¶ Thou shalt not eate any abominable thing .
These are the beasts which yee shall eate : the oxe , the sheepe , and the goat , The Hart , and the Roe bucke , and the fallow deere , and the wilde goat , and the Pygarg , and the wilde oxe , and the chamois .
And euery beast that parteth the hoofe , and cleaueth the clift into two clawes , and cheweth the cud amongst the beasts : that ye shall eate .
Neuerthelesse these yee shall not eate , of them that chew the cud , or of them that diuide the clouen hoofe , as the camel , and the hare , and the cony : for they chew the cudde , but diuide not the hoofe , therefore they are vncleane vnto you .
And the swine , because it diuideth the hoofe , yet cheweth not the cud , it is vncleane vnto you : ye shall not eate of their flesh , nor touch their dead carkeise .
¶ These yee shall eate of all that are in the waters : all that haue finnes and scales shall ye eate :
And whatsoeuer hath not sinnes and scales , ye may not eat : it is vncleane vnto you . ¶ Of all cleane birds ye shall eate .
But these are they of which ye shall not eat : the Eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray , And the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after his kinde ,
And euery rauen after his kinde , And the owle , & the night hawke , and the cuckow , and the hawke after his kinde ,
The little owle , and the great owle , and the swanne , And the pellicane , and the Geer - eagle , and the cormorant ,
But of all cleane foules ye may eat .
¶ Ye shall not eate of any thing that dieth of it selfe : thou shalt giue it vnto the stranger that is in thy gates , that he may eate it , or thou mayest sell it vnto an alien : for thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God . Thou shalt not seethe a kidde in his mothers milke .
Thou shalt truely tithe all the increase of thy seede , that the field bringeth forth yeere by yeere .
And thou shalt eate before the Lord thy God , in the place which he shall chuse to place his Name there , the tithe of thy corne , of thy wine , and of thine oyle , and the firstlings of thy herdes , and of thy flockes : that thou mayest learne to feare the Lord thy God alwayes .
And if the way bee too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carie it , or if the place be too farre from thee , which the Lord thy God shall chuse to set his name there , when the Lord thy God hath blessed thee :
Then shalt thou turne it into money , and binde vp the money in thine hand , and shalt goe vnto the place which the Lord thy God shal chuse .
And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after , for oxen , or for sheepe , or for wine , or for strong drinke , or for whatsoeuer thy soule desireth : and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God , and thou shalt reioyce , thou and thine houshold .
And the Leuite that is within thy gates , thou shalt not forsake him : for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
¶ At the end of three yeres thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same yeere , and shalt lay it vp within thy gates .
<NON-VERSE>
At the end of euery seuen yeeres thou shalt make a release .
And this is the maner of the release : Euery creditour that lendeth ought vnto his neighbour , shall release it : hee shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother , because it is called the Lords release .
Of a forreiner thou mayest exact it againe : but that which is thine with thy brother , thine hand shall release .
Saue when there shall bee no poore among you : for the Lord shal greatly blesse thee in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance to possesse it :
Onely if thou carefully hearken vnto the voice of the Lord thy God , to obserue to doe all these commandedements , which I commaund thee this day .
For the Lord thy God blesseth thee , as he promised thee , and thou shalt lend vnto many nations , but thou shalt not borrow , and thou shalt reigne ouer many nations , but they shall not reigne ouer thee .
¶ If there be among you a poore man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates , in thy lande which the Lord thy God giueth thee , thou shalt not harden thy heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poore brother :
Thou shalt surely giue him , and thine heart shall not bee grieued when thou giuest vnto him : because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all thy workes , and in all that thou puttest thine hand vnto .
For the poore shall neuer cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide vnto thy brother , to thy poore , and to thy needy in the land .
¶ And if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold vnto thee , and serue thee sixe yeres , then in the seuenth yeere thou shalt let him goe free from thee .
And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away emptie :
Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flocke , and out of thy floore , and out of thy wine presse , of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt giue vnto him .
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the Lord thy God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
And it shall be if he say vnto thee , I will not goe away from thee , because he loueth thee , and thine house , because he is well with thee :
Then thou shalt take an aule , and thrust it through his eare vnto the doore , and hee shall be thy seruant for euer : and also vnto thy mayd seruant thou shalt doe likewise .
It shall not seeme hard vnto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee : for hee hath bene worth a double hired seruant to thee , in seruing thee sixe yeeres : and the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all that thou doest .
¶ All the firstling males that come of thy heard , and of thy flock , thou shalt sanctifie vnto the Lord thy God : thou shalt doe no worke with the firstling of thy bullocke , nor sheare the firstling of thy sheepe .
Thou shalt eate it before the Lord thy God yeere by yeere , in the place which the Lord shall choose , thou and thy houshold .
And if there be any blemish therein ; as if it be lame , or blinde , or haue any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it vnto the Lord thy God .
Thou shalt eate it within thy gates : the vncleane and the cleane person shall eat it alike , as the Roe bucke , and as the Hart .
<NON-VERSE>
Obserue the moneth of Abib , and keepe the Passeouer vuto the Lord thy God : for in the moneth of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee foorth out of Egypt by night .
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passeouer vnto the Lord thy God , of the flocke and the heard , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
Thou shalt eat no leauened bread with it : seuen dayes shalt thou eat vnleauened bread therewith , euen the bread of affliction , ( for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste ) that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest foorth out of the land of Egypt , all the dayes of thy life .
And there shall bee no leauened bread seene with thee in all thy coasts seuen dayes , neither shall there any thing of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at Euen , remaine all night , vntill the morning .
Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passeouer within any of the gates , which the Lord thy God giueth thee .
But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his Name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the Passeouer at Euen , at the going downe of the Sunne , at the season that thou camest foorth out of Egypt .
And thou shalt roste and eate it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , and thou shalt turne in the morning , and goe vnto thy tents .
Sixe dayes thou shalt eate vnleauened bread , and on the seuenth day shall be a solemne assembly to the Lord thy God : thou shalt doe no worke therein .
¶ Seuen weekes shalt thou number vnto thee : beginne to number the seuen weekes , from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corne .
And thou shalt keepe the feast of weekes vnto the Lord thy God with a tribute of a free will offering of thine hand , which thou shalt giue vnto the Lord thy God , according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee .
And thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God , thou , and thy sonne , and thy daughter , and thy man seruant and thy maid seruant , and the Leuite that is within thy gates , and the stranger , and the fatherlesse , and the widow , that are among you , in the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to place his Name there .
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt : and thou shalt obserue & do these Statutes .
¶ Thou shalt obserue the feast of Tabernacles seuen dayes , after that thou hast gathered in thy corne , and thy wine .
And thou shalt reioice in thy feast , thou , and thy sonne , and thy daughter , and thy man seruant , and thy maid seruant , and the Leuite , the stranger , and the fatherlesse , and the widow , that are within thy gates .
Seuen dayes shalt thou keepe a solemne feast vnto the Lord thy God , in the place which the Lord shall chuse : because the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all thy increase , and in all the workes of thine handes , therefore thou shalt surely reioyce .
¶ Three times in a yeere shal all thy males appeare before the Lord thy God , in the place which hee shall chuse : in the feast of Unleauened bread , and in the feast of Weekes , and in the feast of Tabernacles : and they shal not appeare before the Lord emptie .
Euery man shall giue as hee is able , according to the blessing of the Lord thy God , which he hath giuen thee .
¶ Iudges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giueth thee throughout thy tribes : and they shall iudge the people with iust iudgement .
Thou shalt not wrest iudgement , thou shalt not respect persons , neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise , and peruert the wordes of the righteous .
That which is altogether iust shalt thou followe , that thou mayest liue , and inherite the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee . ¶ Thou shalt not plant thee a groue of any trees neere vnto the Altar of the Lord thy God , which thou shalt make thee :
<NON-VERSE>
Thou shalt not sacrifice vnto the Lord thy God any bullocke , or sheepe wherein is blemish , or any euilfauourednes : for that is an abomination vnto the Lord thy God .
¶ If there bee found among you within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giueth thee , man or woman that hath wrought wickednes in the sight of the Lord thy God , in transgressing his couenant ,
And hath gone and serued other gods , and worshipped them , either the Sunne , or Moone , or any of the hoste of heauen , which I haue not commanded ,
And it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and behold , it be true , and the thing certaine , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
Then shalt thou bring forth that man , or that woman ( which haue committed that wicked thing ) vnto thy gates , euen that man , or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones till they die . At the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is worthy of death , be put to death : but at the mouth of one witnesse he shall not bee put to death .
The hands of the witnesses shall be first vpon him , to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people : so thou shalt put the euil away from among you . ¶ If there arise a matter too hard for thee in iudgement , betweene blood and blood , betweene plea and plea , and betweene stroke and stroke , being matters of controuersie within thy gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee vp into the place , which the Lord thy God shall choose ;
And thou shalt come vnto the Priests the Leuites , & vnto the Iudge that shal be in those dayes , and enquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of Iudgement . And thou shalt doe according to the sentence which they of that place ( which the Lord shall choose ) shall shew thee , and thou shalt obserue to do according to all that they enforme thee :
According to the sentence of the Law which they shall teach thee , and according to the Iudgement which they shall tell thee thou shalt doe : thou shalt not decline from the Sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
And the man that will doe presumptuously , and will not hearken vnto the Priest ( that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God ) or vnto the Iudge , euen that man shall die , and thou shalt put away the euill from Israel .
And all the people shal heare , and feare , and doe no more presumptuously .
¶ When thou art come vnto the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee , and shalt possesse it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a King ouer mee , like as all the nations that are about me :
Thou shalt in any wise set him King ouer thee , whom the Lord thy God shall choose . One from among thy brethren shalt thou set King ouer thee : thou mayest not set a stranger ouer thee , which is not thy brother .
But he shall not multiply horses to himselfe , nor cause the people to returne to Egypt , to the ende that hee should multiply horses : for as much as the Lord hath said vnto you , Yee shall hencefoorth returne no more that way .
Neither shall he multiply wiues to himselfe , that his heart turne not away : neither shall hee greatly multiply to himselfe siluer and gold .
And it shall be when he sitteth vpon the Throne of his kingdome , that he shall write him a copy of this Law in a booke , out of that which is before the Priests the Leuites .
And it shall be with him , and hee shall reade therein all the dayes of his life , that hee may learne to feare the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this Law , and these Statutes , to do them :
<NON-VERSE>
The Priests , the Leuites , and all the tribe of Leui , shall haue no part nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eate the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and his inheritance .
Therefore shall they haue no inheritance among their brethren : the Lord is their inheritance , as he hath said vnto them .
¶ And this shalbe the Priests due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it bee oxe or sheepe : and they shall giue vnto the Priest the shoulder , and the two cheekes , and the maw .
The first fruit also of thy corne , of thy wine , and of thy oyle , and the first of the fleece of thy sheepe , shalt thou giue him .
For the Lord thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes , to stand to minister in the Name of the Lord , him , and his sonnes for euer .
¶ And if a Leuite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel , where he soiourned , and come with all the desire of his minde , vnto the place which the Lord shall choose ;
Then hee shall minister in the Name of the Lord his God , as all his brethren the Leuites doe , which stand there before the Lord .
They shall haue like portions to eate , beside that which commeth of the sale of his patrimonie .
¶ When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee , thou shalt not learne to doe after the abominations of those nations .
There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his sonne , or his daughter to passe thorow the fire , or that vseth diuination , or an obseruer of times , or an inchanter , or a witch ,
Or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirits , or a wyzard , or a Necromancer .
For all that do these things , are an abomination vnto the Lord : and because of these abominations , the Lord thy God doth driue them out from before thee .
Thou shalt bee perfite with the Lord thy God .
For these nations which thou shalt possesse , hearkened vnto obseruers of times , and vnto diuiners : but as for thee , the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to doe .
¶ The Lord thy God will raise vp vnto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like vnto me , vnto him ye shall hearken ,
According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb , in the day of the assembly , saying , Let mee not heare again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let mee see this great fire any more , that I die not .
And the Lord said vnto mee , They haue well spoken that which they haue spoken .
I will raise them vp a Prophet from among their brethren , like vnto thee , and will put my wordes in his mouth , and hee shall speake vnto them all that I shall command him .
And it shall come to passe , that whosoeuer will not hearken vnto my words , which hee shall speake in my name , I will require it of him .
But the prophet which shall presume to speake a word in my name , which I haue not commanded him to speake , or that shall speake in the name of other gods , euen that prophet shall die .
And if thou say in thine heart , How shall wee know the word which the Lord hath not spoken ?
<NON-VERSE>
Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and diuide the coasts of thy land ( which the Lord thy God giueth thee to inherit ) into three parts , that euery slayer may flee thither .
¶ And this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither , that hee may liue : who so killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ,
As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor , to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut downe the tree , and the head slippeth from the helue , and lighteth vpon his neighbour that he die , he shall flee vnto one of those cities , and liue :
Lest the auenger of the blood pursue the slaier , while his heart is hot , and ouertake him , because the way is long , and slay him , whereas he was not worthy of death , in as much as hee hated him not in time past .
Wherefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt separate three cities for thee .
And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy coast ( as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers ) and giue thee all the lande which hee promised to giue vnto thy fathers :
( If thou shalt keepe all these commandements to doe them , which I command thee this day , to loue the Lord thy God , and to walke euer in his wayes ) then shalt thou adde three cities moe for thee , beside these three :
That innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be vpon thee .
¶ But if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him , and rise vp against him , and smite him mortally that hee die , and fleeth into one of these Cities :
Then the Elders of his citie shall send and fetch him thence , and deliuer him into the hand of the auenger of blood , that he may die .
Thine eye shall not pittie him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel , that it may goe wel with thee .
¶ Thou shalt not remooue thy neighbours land - marke , which they of old time haue set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherite , in the land that the Lord thy God giueth thee to possesse it .
¶ One witnesse shall not rise vp against a man for any iniquitie , or for any sinne , in any sinne that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall the matter be stablished .
¶ If a false witnes rise vp against any man to testifie against him that which is wrong :
Then both the men betweene whom the controuersie is , shall stand before the Lord , before the Priests , and the Iudges , which shall be in those dayes .
And the Iudges shall make diligent inquisition : and behold , if the witnesse be a false witnesse , and hath testified falsly against his brother :
Then shall ye doe vnto him , as he had thought to haue done vnto his brother : so shalt thou put the euil away from among you .
And those which remaine shall heare , and feare , and shall hencefoorth commit no more any such euill among you .
<NON-VERSE>
When thou goest out to battell against thine enemies , and seest horses and charets , and a people more then thou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord thy God is with thee , which brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt .
And it shall bee when ye are come nigh vnto the battell , that the Priest shall approach and speake vnto the people ,
And shall say vnto them , Heare O Israel , you approach this day vnto battell against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , feare not , and doe not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them .
For the Lord your God is hee that goeth with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to saue you .
And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him goe and returne vnto his house , lest he die in battell , and another man take her . And the Officers shall speake further vnto the people : and they shall say , What man is there that is fearefull and faint hearted ? let him goe and returne vnto his house , lest his brethrens heart faint as well as his heart .
And it shall be when the Officers haue made an end of speaking vnto the people , that they shall make Captaines of the armies to leade the people .
¶ When thou commest nigh vnto a City to fight against it , then proclaime peace vnto it . And it shall be , if it make thee answere of peace , and open vnto thee , then it shalbe that all the people that is found therein , shall be tributaries vnto thee , and they shall serue thee .
And if it will make no peace with thee , but will make warre against thee , then thou shalt besiege it .
And when the Lord thy God hath deliuered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite euery male thereof with the edge of the sword .
But the women , and the litle ones , and the cattell , and all that is in the citie , euen all the spoile thereof , shalt thou take vnto thy selfe , and thou shalt eate the spoile of thine enemies , which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee .
Thus shalt thou doe vnto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
But of the cities of these people which the Lord thy God doth giue thee for an inheritance , thou shalt saue aliue nothing that breatheth :
But thou shalt vtterly destroy them , namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hiuites , and the Iebusites , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee :
That they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they haue done vnto their gods , so should ye sinne against the Lord your God .
¶ When thou shalt besiege a citie a long time , in making warre against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof , by forcing an axe against them : for thou mayest eate of them , and thou shalt not cut them downe ( for the tree of the field is mans life ) to employ them in the siege .
<NON-VERSE>
If one bee found slaine in the lande , which the Lord thy God giueth thee to possesse it , lying in the fielde , and it bee not knowen who hath slaine him :
Then thy Elders and thy Iudges shall come forth , and they shall measure vnto the cities which are round about him that is slaine .
And it shall be that the citie which is next vnto the slaine man , euen the Elders of that citie shall take an heifer which hath not bene wrought with , and which hath not drawen in the yoke .
And the Elders of that citie shall bring downe the heifer vnto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sowen , and shall strike off the heifers necke there in the valley .
And the Priests the sonnes of Leui shall come neere ( for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister vnto him , and to blesse in the Name of the Lord : ) and by their worde shall euery controuersie and euery stroke bee tried .
And all the Elders of that city that are next vnto the slaine man , shal wash their hands ouer the heifer that is beheaded in the valley .
So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
¶ When thou goest forth to warre against thine enemies , and the Lord thy God hath deliuered them into thine hands , & thou hast taken them captiue , And seest among the captiues a beautifull woman , and hast a desire vnto her , that thou wouldest haue her to thy wife :
Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house , and shee shall shaue her head , and pare her nailes .
And shee shall put the raiment of her captiuitie from off her , and shall remaine in thine house , and bewaile her father and her mother a full moneth : and after that , thou shalt go in vnto her and be her husband , and she shall be thy wife .
And it shall be if thou haue no delight in her , then thou shalt let her goe whither she will , but thou shalt not sell her at al for money , thou shalt not make merchandize of her , because thou hast humbled her .
But hee shall acknowledge the sonne of the hated for the first borne , by giuing him a double portion of all that hee hath : for hee is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the first borne is his .
¶ If a man haue a stubborne and rebellious sonne , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that when they haue chastened him , wil not hearken vnto them :
Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out vnto the Elders of his citie , and vnto the gate of his place :
And they shall say vnto the Elders of his citie , This our sonne is stubborne , and rebellious , hee will not obey our voice : he is a glutton , & a drunkard .
And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that hee die : so shalt thou put euill away from among you , and all Israel shall heare , & feare .
¶ And if a man haue committed a sinne worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
<NON-VERSE>
Thou shalt not see thy brothers oxe , or his sheepe go astray , and hide thy selfe from them : thou shalt in any case bring them againe vnto thy brother .
And if thy brother be not nigh vnto thee , or if thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it vnto thine owne house , and it shall be with thee , vntil thy brother seeke after it , and thou shalt restore it to him againe .
In like maner shalt thou do with his asse , and so shalt thou doe with his raiment : and with all lost thing of thy brothers which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thy selfe .
¶ Thou shalt not see thy brothers asse or his oxe fall downe by the way , and hide thy selfe from them : thou shalt surely helpe him to lift them vp againe .
¶ The woman shall not weare that which pertaineth vnto a man , neither shall a man put on a womans garment : for all that doe so , are abomination vnto the Lord thy God .
¶ If a birds nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be yong ones , or egges , and the damme sitting vpon the yong , or vpon the egges , thou shalt not take the damme with the yong .
But thou shalt in any wise let the damme goe , and take the yong to thee , that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy dayes .
¶ When thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roofe , that thou bring not blood vpon thine house , if any man fall from thence .
¶ Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diuers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sowen , and the fruit of thy Uineyard be defiled .
¶ Thou shalt not plow with an oxe and an asse together .
¶ Thou shalt not weare a garment of diuers sorts , as of woollen , and linnen together .
¶ Thou shalt make thee fringes vpon the foure quarters of thy vesture , wherewith thou couerest thy selfe .
¶ If any man take a wife , and go in vnto her , and hate her ,
And giue occasions of speach against her , and bring vp an euill name vpon her , and say , I tooke this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a mayd :
Then shal the father of the damosell , and her mother take , and bring forth the tokens of the damosels virginitie , vnto the Elders of the citie in the gate .
And the damosels father shall say vnto the Elders , I gaue my daughter vnto this man to wife , & he hateth her :
And loe , he hath giuen occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid : and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginity ; and they shall spread the cloth before the Elders of the citie .
And the Elders of that citie shall take that man , and chastise him .
And they shall amearse him in an hundred shekels of siluer , and giue them vnto the father of the damosell , because he hath brought vp an euill name vpon a virgine of Israel : and she shall be his wife , hee may not put her away all his dayes .
But if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginitie be not found for the damosel :
Then they shall bring out the damosell to the doore of her fathers house , and the men of her city shal stone her with stones that she die , because she hath wrought folly in Israel , to play the whore in her fathers house : so shalt thou put euill away from among you .
¶ If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away euill from Israel .
¶ If a damosell that is a virgin be betrothed vnto an husband , and a man find her in the citie , and lie with her :
Then yee shall bring them both out vnto the gate of that citie , and yee shall stone them with stones that they die ; the damosel , because shee cried not , being in the citie ; and the man , because he hath humbled his neighbours wife : so thou shalt put away euill from among you .

¶ And Moses called vnto all Israel , and said vnto them , Yee haue seene all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt vnto Pharaoh , and vnto all his seruants , and vnto all his land ;
The great temptations which thine eyes haue seene , the signes and those great miracles :
Yet the Lord hath not giuen you an heart to perceiue , and eyes to see , and eares to heare , vnto this day .
And I haue led you fourtie yeres in the wildernes : your clothes are not waxen old vpon you , and thy shooe is not waxen old vpon thy foot .
Ye haue not eaten bread , neither haue you drunke wine , or strong drink : that yee might knowe that I am the Lord your God .
And when yee came vnto this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the King of Bashan , came out against vs vnto battell , and wee smote them .
And wee tooke their lande , and gaue it for an inheritance vnto the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh .
Keepe therefore the wordes of this Couenant and doe them , that yee may prosper in all that ye doe .
¶ Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God : your captaines of your tribes , your Elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
Your litle ones , your wiues , and thy stranger that is in thy campe , from the hewer of thy wood , vnto the drawer of thy water :
That thou shouldest enter into Couenant with the Lord thy God , and into his othe which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day :
That he may establish thee to day for a people vnto himselfe , and that hee may be vnto thee a God , as he hath said vnto thee , and as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Iacob . Neither with you onely doe I make this couenant and this othe :
But with him that standeth here with vs this day before the Lord our God , and also with him that is not here with vs this day :
( For ye know how we haue dwelt in the land of Egypt , and how we came thorow the nations which ye passed by .
And ye haue seene their abominations , and their idoles , wood , and stone , siluer , and gold , which were among them . )
Lest there should be among you man or woman , or familie , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God , to goe and serue the gods of these nations : lest there should bee among you a root that beareth gall and wormewood ,
And it come to passe when he heareth the wordes of this curse , that hee blesse himselfe in his heart , saying , I shall haue peace , though I walke in the imagination of mine heart , to adde drunkennesse to thirst :
The Lord wil not spare him , but then the anger of the Lord , and his ielousie shall smoke against that man , and all the curses that are written in this booke shall lie vpon him , and the Lord shall blot out his name from vnder heauen .
And the Lord shall separate him vnto euill , out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Couenant , that are written in this booke of the Law :
So that the generation to come of your children , that shall rise vp after you , and the stranger that shall come from a farre land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses which the Lord hath layd vpon it ;
And that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt , and burning , that it is not sowen , nor beareth , nor any grasse groweth therein , like the ouerthrow of Sodome , and Gomorah , Admah , and Zeboim , which the Lord ouerthrew in his anger , and in his wrath :
Euen al nations shal say , Wherefore hath the Lord done thus vnto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
Then men shall say , Because they haue forsaken the Couenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them foorth out of the land of Egypt .
For they went and serued other gods , & worshipped them , gods whom they knew not , and whom he had not giuen vnto them .
And the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land , to bring vpon it all the curses , that are written in this booke .
And the Lord rooted them out of their land , in anger and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
<NON-VERSE>
And it shall come to passe when all these things are come vpon thee , the blessing , and the curse , which I haue set before thee , and thou shalt call them to minde among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driuen thee ,
And shalt returne vnto the Lord thy God , and shalt obey his voyce according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children with al thine heart , and with all thy soule :
That then the Lord thy God will turne thy captiuitie , and haue compassion vpon thee , and wil returne and gather thee from all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee .
If any of thine be driuen out vnto the outmost parts of heauen , from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee .
And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possesse it : and he will doe thee good , and multiply thee aboue thy fathers .
And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soule , that thou mayest liue .
And the Lord thy God will put all these curses vpon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
And thou shalt returne and obey the voice of the Lord , and doe all his Commandements which I command thee this day .
And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in euery worke of thine hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattell , and in the fruit of thy land , for good : for the Lord will againe reioyce ouer thee for good , as he reioyced ouer thy fathers :
If thou shalt hearken vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God to keepe his Commandements , and his Statutes which are written in this booke of the Law , and if thou turne vnto the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soule .
¶ For this Commaundement which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it farre off .
It is not in heauen , that thou shouldest say , Who shal goe vp for vs to heauen , and bring it vnto vs , that wee may heare it , and doe it ?
Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall goe ouer the sea for vs , and bring it vnto vs , that we may heare it , and doe it ?
But the word is very nigh vnto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest doe it .
¶ See , I haue set before thee this day , life and good , and death , and euill :
In that I command thee this day to loue the Lord thy God , to walke in his wayes , and to keepe his Commandements , and his Statutes , and his Iudgements , that thou maiest liue and multiply : and the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in the land , whither thou goest to possesse it .
But if thine heart turne away , so that thou wilt not heare , but shalt bee drawen away , and worship other gods and serue them :
I denounce vnto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that yee shall not prolong your dayes vpon the land , whither thou passest ouer Iordan , to goe to possesse it .
I call heauen and earth to record this day against you , that I haue set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may liue :

And Moses went & spake these wordes vnto all Israel .
And hee saide vnto them , I am an hundred and twentie yeeres old this day ; I can no more goe out and come in : also the Lord hath said vnto mee , Thou shalt not goe ouer this Iordan .
The Lord thy God , hee will goe ouer before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possesse them : and Ioshua , hee shall goe ouer before thee , as the Lord hath said .
And the Lord shall doe vnto them , as hee did to Sihon , and to Og Kings of the Amorites , and vnto the land of them , whom he destroyed .
And the Lord shall giue them vp before your face , that ye may doe vnto them according vnto all the Commandements which I haue commanded you .
Be strong , and of a good courage , feare not , nor be afraid of them : for the Lord thy God , he it is that doeth goe with thee , he will not faile thee , nor forsake thee .
¶ And Moses called vnto Ioshua , and said vnto him in the sight of all Israel , Bee strong , and of a good courage : for thou must goe with this people vnto the land , which the Lord hath sworne vnto their fathers to giue them ; and thou shalt cause them to inherite it .
And the Lord , he it is that doth goe before thee , he will be with thee , hee will not faile thee , neither forsake thee : feare not , neither be dismayed .
¶ And Moses wrote this Law , and deliuered it vnto the Priests the sonnes of Leui , which bare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , and vnto all the Elders of Israel . And Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of euery seuen yeeres , in the solemnitie of the yeere of release , in the feast of Tabernacles ,
When all Israel is come to appeare before the Lord thy God , in the place which hee shall choose ; thou shalt reade this Law before all Israel , in their hearing .
Gather the people together , men , and women and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may heare , and that they may learne , and feare the Lord your God , and obserue to doe all the wordes of this Law :
And that their children which haue not knowen any thing , may heare , and learne to feare the Lord your God , as long as yee liue in the land , whither ye goe ouer Iordan to possesse it .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Beholde , thy dayes approach that thou must die : call Ioshua , and present your selues in the Tabernacle of the Congregation , that I may giue him a charge . And Moses and Ioshua went and presented themselues in the Tabernacle of the Congregation .
And the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud : and the pillar of the cloude stood ouer the doore of the Tabernacle .
And I will surely hide my face in that day , for all the euils which they shal haue wrought , in that they are turned vnto other gods .
Now therefore , write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouthes , that this song may be a witnesse for mee , against the children of Israel .
For when I shall haue brought them into the land which I sware vnto their fathers , that floweth with milke and hony ; and they shall haue eaten and filled themselues , and waxen fat ; then will they turne vnto other gods , and serue them , and prouoke me , and breake my couenant .
And it shall come to passe , when many euils and troubles are befallen them , that this song shall testifie against them as a witnesse : for it shall not bee forgotten out of the mouthes of their seed : for I know their imagination which they goe about euen now , before I haue brought them into the land , which I sware .
¶ Moses therefore wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of Israel .
That Moses commaunded the Leuites which bare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , saying ,
Take this booke of the Law , and put it in the side of the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord your God , that it may bee there for a witnesse against thee .
For I know thy rebellion , and thy stiffe necke : Beholde , while I am yet aliue with you this day , yee haue bene rebellious against the Lord ; and how much more after my death ?
¶ Gather vnto mee all the Elders of your tribes , and your Officers , that I may speake these words in their eares , and call heauen and earth to record against them .
For I know , that after my death yee will vtterly corrupt your selues , and turne aside from the way , which I haue commauded you : and euil wil befall you in the latter dayes , because yee wil doe euil in the sight of the Lord , to prouoke him to anger through the worke of your hands .
<NON-VERSE>
Giue eare , O yee heauens , and I will speake ; And heare , O earth , the words of my mouth .
My doctrine shall drop as the raine : my speech shall distill as the deaw , as the smal raine vpon the tender herbe , and as the showres vpon the grasse .
Because I wil publish the Name of the Lord : ascribe yee greatnesse vnto our God .
He is the rocke , his worke is perfect : for all his wayes are Iudgement : A God of trueth , and without iniquity , iust and right is he .
They haue corrupted themselues , their spot is not the spot of his children : they are a peruerse and crooked generation .
Doe ye thus requite the Lord , O foolish people , & vnwise ? Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee ? Hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
¶ Remember the dayes of olde , consider the yeeres of many generations : aske thy father , and he will shewe thee , thy Elders , and they wil tell thee .
When the most High diuided to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the sonnes of Adam , hee set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
For the Lords portion is his people : Iacob is the lot of his inheritance .
He found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wildernesse : Hee ledde him about , he instructed him , hee kept him as the apple of his eye .
As an Eagle stirreth vp her nest , fluttereth ouer her yong , spreadeth abroad her wings , taketh them , beareth them on her wings :
So the Lord alone did leade him , and there was no strange God with him .
He made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eate the increase of the fields , and he made him to sucke hony out of the rocke , and oyle out of the flintie rocke ,
Butter of kine , & milke of sheepe , with fat of lambes , and rammes of the breed of Bashan , & goats , with the fat of kidneis of wheat , and thou diddest drinke the pure blood of the grape .
¶ But Iesurun waxed fat , and kicked : Thou art waxen fat , thou art growen thicke , thou art couered with fatnes : then he forsooke God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rocke of his saluation .
They prouoked him to ielousie with strange gods , with abominations prouoked they him to anger .
They sacrificed vnto deuils , not to God : to gods whom they knew not , to new gods , that came newly vp , whom your fathers feared not .
Of the Rocke that begate thee thou art vnmindfull , and hast forgotten God that formed thee .
And when the Lord saw it , he abhorred them , because of the prouoking of his sonnes , & of his daughters .
And he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their ende shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
They haue mooued me to ielousie with that which is not god , they haue prouoked me to anger with their vanities : And I will moue them to ielousie with those which are not a people , I will prouoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
For a fire is kindled in my anger , and shall burne vnto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountaines .
I will heape mischiefes vpon them , I will spend mine arrowes vpon them .
They shall bee burnt with hunger and deuoured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction : I will also send the teeth of beasts vpon them , with the poison of serpents of the dust .
The sword without , and terrour within shall destroy both the yong man , and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray haires .
I said , I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men :
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemie , lest their aduersaries should behaue themselues strangely , and lest they should say , Our hande is high , and the Lord hath not done all this .
For they are a nation voide of counsel , neither is there any vnderstanding in them .
O that they were wise , that they vnderstood this , that they would consider their latter end .
How should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , except their Rocke had sold them , and the Lord had shut them vp ?
For their rocke is not as our Rocke , euen our enemies themselues being iudges .
For their vine is of the vine of Sodome , and of the fields of Gomorah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter .
Their wine is the poison of dragons , and the cruell venime of Aspes .
Is not this laide vp in store with me , and sealed vp among my treasures ?
To me belongeth vengeance , and recompence , their foot shall slide in due time : for the day of their calamitie is at hand , and the things that shal come vpon them , make haste .
For the Lord shall iudge his people , and repent himselfe for his seruants , when he seeth that their power is gone ; and there is none shut vp , or left .
And he shall say , where are their gods ? their Rocke in whom they trusted ;
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , & dranke the wine of their drinke offerings ? let them rise vp and helpe you , and be your protection .
See now , that I , euen I am he , and there is no god with mee ; I kill , and I make aliue : I wound , and I heale : neither is there any that can deliuer out of my hand .
For I lift vp my hand to heauen , and say , I liue for euer .
If I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take holde on Iudgement , I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
I will make mine arrowes drunke with blood , ( and my sword shal deuoure flesh ) and that with the blood of the slaine , and of the captiues , from the beginning of reuenges vpon the enemie .
Reioyce , O ye nations with his people , for he will auenge the blood of his seruants , and will render vengeance to his aduersaries , and wil be mercifull vnto his land , and to his people .
¶ And Moses came and spake all the wordes of this song in the eares of the people , he and Hoshea the sonne of Nun .
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel .
And hee said vnto them , Set your hearts vnto all the wordes which I testifie among you this day , which yee shall commaund your children to obserue to doe all the wordes of this Law .
For it is not a vaine thing for you : because it is your life , and through this thing yee shall prolong your dayes , in the land whither yee goe ouer Iordan to possesse it .
And the Lord spake vnto Moses that selfe same day , saying ,
Get thee vp into this mountaine Abarim , vnto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is ouer against Iericho , and behold the land of Canaan which I giue vnto the children of Israel for a possession :
And die in the mount whither thou goest vp , and bee gathered vnto thy people , as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered vnto his people :
Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel , at the waters of Meribah Kadesh , in the wildernesse of Zin : because yee sanctified mee not in the midst of the children of Israel .
<NON-VERSE>
And this is the blessing , wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
And he said , The Lord came from Sinai , and rose vp from Seir vnto them , hee shined foorth from mount Paran , and hee came with ten thousands of Saints : from his Right hand went a fierie Law for them .
Yea hee loued the people ; all his Saints are in thy hand : and they sate downe at thy feete ; euery one shall receiue of thy wordes .
Moses commaunded vs a Law , euen the inheritance of the Congregation of Iacob .
And hee was King in Iesurun , when the heads of the people , and the Tribes of Israel were gathered together .
¶ Let Reuben liue , and not die , and let not his men be few .
¶ And this is the blessing of Iudah : and he said , Heare , Lord , the voice of Iudah , and bring him vnto his people : let his hands bee sufficient for him , and bee thou an helpe to him from his enemies .
¶ And of Leui hee said , Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one , whom thou diddest prooue at Massah , & with whom thou didst striue at the waters of Meribah :
Who said vnto his father & to his mother , I haue not seene him , neither did hee acknowledge his brethren ; nor knew his owne children : for they haue obserued thy word , and kept thy Couenant .
They shal teach Iacob thy iudgments , and Israel thy Lawe : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice vpon thine Altar .
Blesse , Lord , his substance , and accept the worke of his handes , smite thorow the loines of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not againe .
¶ And of Beniamin he said , The beloued of the Lord shall dwell in safetie by him , and the Lord shall couer him all the day long , and he shall dwell betweene his shoulders .
¶ And of Ioseph he said , Blessed of the Lord be his land , for the precious things of heauen , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ;
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sunne , and for the precious things put forth by the moone ,
And for the chiefe things of the ancient mountaines , and for the precious things of the lasting hils ,
And for the precious things of the earth , and fulnesse thereof , and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come vpon the head of Ioseph , and vpon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
His glory is like the firstling of his bullocke , & his hornes are like the hornes of Unicornes : with them he shall push the people together , to the ends of the earth : and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim , and they are the thousands of Manasseh .
¶ And of Zebulun he said , Reioyce , Zebulun , in thy going out ; and Issachar , in thy tents .
They shall call the people vnto the mountaine , there they shal offer sacrifices of righteousnesse : for they shall sucke of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
¶ And of Gad he said , Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad : he dwelleth as a lyon , and teareth the arme with the crowne of the head .
And he prouided the first part for himselfe , because there , in a portion of the lawgiuer was he seated , and hee came with the heads of the people , he executed the iustice of the Lord , and his iudgments with Israel .
¶ And of Dan he said , Dan is a Lyons whelpe : hee shall leape from Bashan .
¶ And of Naphtali he said , O Naphtali , satisfied with fauour , and full with the blessing of the Lord : possesse thou the West and the South .
¶ And of Asher hee said , let Asher be blessed with children , Let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oile .
Thy shooes shall bee yron and brasse , and as thy dayes , so shall thy strength bee .
¶ There is none like vnto the God of Iesurun , who rideth vpon the heauen in thy helpe , and in his excellencie on the skie .
The eternall God is thy refuge , and vnderneath are the euerlasting armes : and he shall thrust out the enemie from before thee , and shall say , Destroy them .
Israel then shall dwell in safetie alone : the fountaine of Iacob shalbe vpon a land of corne and wine , also his heauens shall drop downe deaw .

And Moses went vp from the plaines of Moab , vnto the mountaine of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is ouer against Iericho : and the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead , vnto Dan ,
And all Naphtali , and the lande of Ephraim , and Manasseh , and all the land of Iudah , vnto the vtmost sea .
And the South , and the plaine of the valley of Iericho , the citie of palme trees vnto Zoar .
And the Lord said vnto him , This is the land which I sware vnto Abraham , vnto Isaac , and vnto Iacob , saying , I will giue it vnto thy seed : I haue caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go ouer thither .
¶ So Moses the seruant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord .
And hee buried him in a valley in the land of Moab , ouer against Beth - Peor : but no man knoweth of his Sepulchre vnto this day .
¶ And Moses was an hundred and twentie yeeres olde when he died : his eye was not dimme , nor his naturall force abated .
¶ And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plaines of Moab thirty dayes : So the dayes of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended .
¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun was full of the Spirit of wisedome : for Moses had layd his handes vpon him , and the children of Israel hearkened vnto him , and did as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And there arose not a Prophet since in Israel like vnto Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face :
In al the signes and the wonders which the Lord sent him to doe in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh , and to all his seruants , and to all his land ,

The wordes of the Preacher , the son of Dauid , King in Ierusalem .
Uanitie of vanities , saith the Preacher , vanitie of vanities , all is vanitie .
The Sunne also ariseth , and the Sunne goeth downe , and hasteth to the place where he arose .
The winde goeth toward the South , and turneth about vnto the North ; it whirleth about continually , and the winde returneth againe according to his circuits .
All the riuers runne into the sea , yet the Sea is not full : vnto the place from whence the riuers come , thither they returne againe .
All things are full of labour , man cannot vtter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the eare filled with hearing .
The thing that hath beene , it is that which shall be : and that which is done , is that which shall be done ; and there is no new thing vnder the sunne . Is there any thing , whereof it may be sayd , See , this is new ? it hath beene already of olde time , which was before vs .
There is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there bee any remembrance of things that are to come , with those that shall come after .
¶ I the Preacher was king ouer Israel in Ierusalem .
And I gaue my heart to seeke and search out by wisedome , concerning all things that are done vnder heauen : this sore trauell hath God giuen to the sonnes of man , to be exercised therewith .
I haue seene all the workes that are done vnder the Sunne , and behold , all is vanitie , and vexation of spirit .
That which is crooked , cannot be made straight : and that which is wanting cannot be numbred .
I communed with mine owne heart , saying , Loe , I am come to great estate , and haue gotten more wisedome then all they that haue beene before me in Ierusalem : yea my heart had great experience of wisedome & knowledge .
And I gaue my heart to know wisedome , and to know madnesse and folly : I perceiued that this also is vexation of spirit .
<NON-VERSE>
I said in mine heart , Goe to now , I wil prooue thee with mirth , therfore enioy pleasure : and behold , this also is vanitie .
I saide of laughter , It is mad : and of mirth , What doeth it ?
I sought in mine heart to giue my selfe vnto wine , ( yet acquainting mine heart with wisedome ) and to lay hold on folly , till I might see what was that good for the sonnes of men , which they should doe vnder the heauen all the dayes of their life .
I made me great workes , I builded mee houses , I planted mee Uineyards .
I made mee gardens & orchards , and I planted trees in them of all kinde of fruits .
I made mee pooles of water , to water therewith the wood that bringeth foorth trees :
I got me seruants and maydens , and had seruants borne in my house ; also I had great possessions of great and small cattell , aboue all that were in Ierusalem before me .
I gathered mee also siluer and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the prouinces : I gate mee men singers and women singers , and the delights of the sonnes of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
So I was great , and increased more then all that were before mee in Ierusalem ; also my wisedome remained with me .
And whatsoeuer mine eyes desired , I kept not from them ; I withheld not my heart from any ioy : for my heart reioyced in all my labour ; and this was my portion of all my labour .
Then I looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought , and on the labour that I had laboured to doe : and behold , all was vanitie , and vexation of spirit , and there was no profit vnder the Sunne .
¶ And I turned my selfe to behold wisedome , and madnesse and folly : for what can the man doe , that commeth after the king ? euen that which hath bene already done .
Then I saw that wisedome excelleth folly , as farre as light excelleth darkenesse .
The wise mans eyes are in his head , but the foole walketh in darknes : and I my selfe perceiued also that one euent happeneth to them all .
Then said I in my heart , As it happeneth to the foole , so it happeneth euen to me , and why was I then more wise ? then I said in my heart , That this also is vanitie .
For there is no remembrance of the wise , more then of the foole for euer ; seeing that which now is , in the dayes to come shall be forgotten ; and how dieth the wise man ? as the foole .
Therefore I hated life , because the worke that is wrought vnder the Sunne is grieuous vnto mee : for all is vanitie , and vexation of spirit .
¶ Yea I hated all my labour which I had taken vnder the Sunne : because I should leaue it vnto the man that shalbe after mee .
And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a foole ? yet shall he haue rule ouer all my labour , wherein I haue laboured , and wherein I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the Sunne . This is also vanitie .
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despaire of all the labour which I tooke vnder the Sunne .
For there is a man whose labour is in wisedome and in knowledge , and in equitie : yet to a man that hath not laboured therein , shall hee leaue it for his portion ; This also is vanitie , and a great euill .
For what hath man of all his labour , and of the vexation of his heart wherein hee hath laboured vnder the Sunne ?
For all his dayes are sorrowes , and his traueile , griefe ; yea his heart taketh not rest in the night . This is also vanitie .
¶ There is nothing better for a man , then that he should eat and drinke , and that he should make his soule enioy good in his labour . This also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
For who can eate ? or who else can hasten hereunto more then I ?
<NON-VERSE>
To euery thing there is a season , and a time to euery purpose vnder the heauen .
A time to be borne , and a time to die : a time to plant , and a time to pluck vp that which is planted .
A time to kill , and a time to heale : a time to breake downe , and a time to build vp .
A time to weepe , and a time to laugh : a time to mourne , and a time to dance .
A time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together : a time to imbrace , and a time to refraine from imbracing .
A time to get , and a time to lose : a time to keepe , and a time to cast away .
A time to rent , and a time to sow : a time to keepe silence , and a time to speake .
A time to loue , and a time to hate : a time of warre , and a time of peace .
What profite hath hee that worketh , in that wherein he laboureth ?
I haue seene the trauaile which God hath giuen to the sonnes of men , to be exercised in it .
He hath made euery thing beautifull in his time : also hee hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can finde out the worke that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to reioyce , and to doe good in his life .
And also that euery man should eate and drinke , and enioy the good of all his labour : it is the gift of God .
I know that whatsoeuer God doeth , it shalbe for euer : nothing can be put to it , nor any thing taken from it : and God doth it , that men should feare before him .
That which hath beene , is now : and that which is to be , hath alreadie beene , and God requireth that which is past .
¶ And moreouer , I sawe vnder the Sunne the place of iudgement , that wickednesse was there ; and the place of righteousnesse , that iniquitie was there .
I said in mine heart , God shall iudge the righteous and the wicked : for there is a time there , for euery purpose and for euery worke .
I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sonnes of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselues are beasts .
For that which befalleth the sonnes of men , befalleth beastes , euen one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea they haue all one breath , so that a man hath no preheminence aboue a beast ; for all is vanitie .
All goe vnto one place , all are of the dust , and all turne to dust againe .
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth vpward ; and the spirit of the beast that goeth downeward to the earth ?
<NON-VERSE>
So I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done vnder the sunne ; & behold the teares of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter : and on the side of their oppressours there was power , but they had no comforter .
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead , more then the liuing which are yet aliue .
Yea better is he then both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seene the euill worke that is done vnder the Sunne .
¶ Againe I considered all trauaile , and euery right worke , that for this a man is enuied of his neighbour : this is also vanitie , and vexation of spirit .
The foole foldeth his hands together , and eateth his owne flesh .
Better is an handfull with quietnesse , then both the hands full with trauell and vexation of spirit .
¶ Then I returned , and I saw vanitie vnder the Sunne .
There is one alone , and there is not a second ; yea , he hath neither childe nor brother : yet is there no end of all his labour , neither is his eye satisfied with riches , neither sayth hee , For whom doe I labour , and bereaue my soule of good ? this is also vanitie , yea it is a sore trauell .
¶ Two are better then one ; because they haue a good reward for their labour .
For if they fall , the one will lift vp his fellow ; but woe to him that is alone , when he falleth : for he hath not another to helpe him vp .
Againe , if two lye together , then they haue heate ; but howe can one be warme alone ?
And if one preuaile against him , two shall withstand him ; and a threefold coard is not quickly broken .
¶ Better is a poore and a wise child , then an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished .
For out of prison hee commeth to raigne , whereas also he that is borne in his kingdome , becommeth poore .
I considered all the liuing which walke vnder the sunne , with the second child that shall stand vp in his stead .
<NON-VERSE>
Kepe thy foote when thou goest to the house of God , and be more ready to heare , then to giue the sacrifice of fooles : for they consider not that they doe euill .
Be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to vtter any thing before God : for God is in heauen , and thou vpon earth : therefore let thy words be few . For a dreame commeth through the multitude of businesse , and a fooles voyce is knowen by multitude of words .
When thou vowest a vow vnto God , deferre not to pay it : for he hath no pleasure in fooles ; pay that which thou hast vowed .
Better is it that thou shouldest not vowe , then that thou shouldest vowe and not pay .
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sinne , neither say thou before the Angel , that it was an errour : wherefore should God be angrie at thy voyce , and destroy the worke of thine hands ?
For in the multitude of dreames and many words , there are also diuers vanities : but feare thou God .
¶ If thou seest the oppression of the poore , and violent peruerting of iudgement , and iustice in a prouince , maruell not at the matter : for he that is higher then the highest , regardeth , and there be higher then they .
¶ Moreouer the profit of the earth is for all : the king himselfe is serued by the field .
Hee that loueth siluer shall not be satisfied with siluer ; nor he that loueth abundance , with increase : this is also vanitie .
When goods increase , they are increased that eate them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , sauing the beholding of them with their eyes ?
The sleepe of a labouring man is sweete , whether he eate little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleepe .
There is a sore euill which I haue seene vnder the Sun , namely riches kept for the owners therof to their hurt .
But those riches perish by euill trauell ; and he begetteth a sonne , and there is nothing in his hand .
As he came forth of his mothers wombe , naked shall he returne to goe as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
And this also is a sore euill , that in all points as he came , so shall hee goe : and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the winde ?
All his dayes also hee eateth in darkenesse , and he hath much sorrowe , and wrath with his sicknesse .
¶ Behold that which I haue seene : It is good and comely for one to eate and to drinke , and to enioy the good of all his labour that he taketh vnder the sunne , all the dayes of his life , which God giueth him : for it is his portion .
Euery man also to whom God hath giuen riches and wealth , and hath giuen him power to eate thereof , and to take his portion , and to reioyce in his labour ; this is the gift of God .
<NON-VERSE>
There is an euill which I haue seen vnder the Sun , and it is common among men :
A man to whom God hath giuen riches , wealth and honour , so that he wanteth nothing for his soule of all that he desireth , yet God giueth him not power to eate thereof , but a stranger eateth it : This is vanitie , and it is an euill disease .
¶ If a man beget an hundred children , and liue many yeeres , so that the dayes of his yeeres bee many : and his soule be not filled with good , and also that he haue no buriall , I say , that an vntimely birth is better then he .
For he commeth in with vanitie , and departeth in darkenesse , and his name shall be couered with darkenesse .
Moreouer hee hath not seene the Sunne , nor knowen any thing : this hath more rest then the other .
¶ Yea though he liue a thousand yeeres twice told , yet hath he seene no good : Doe not all goe to one place ?
All the labour of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
For what hath the wise more then the foole ? what hath the poore , that knoweth to walke before the liuing ?
¶ Better is the sight of the eyes , then the wandering of the desire : this is also vanitie and vexation of spirit .
That which hath bene , is named already , and it is knowen that it is man : neither may he contend with him that is mightier then he .
¶ Seeing there be many things that increase vanitie , what is man the better ?
<NON-VERSE>
A Good name is better then precious ointment : and the day of death , then the day of ones birth .
¶ It is better to goe to the house of mourning , then to goe to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the liuing will lay it to his heart .
Sorrow is better then laughter : for by the sadnesse of the countenance the heart is made better .
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning : but the heart of fooles is in the house of mirth .
It is better to heare the rebuke of the wise , then for a man to heare the song of fooles .
For as the crackling of thornes vnder a pot , so is the laughter of the foole : this also is vanitie .
¶ Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad : and a gift destroyeth the heart .
Better is the ende of a thing then the beginning thereof : and the patient in spirit is better then the proude in spirit .
Be not hastie in thy spirit to bee angry : for anger resteth in the bosome of fooles .
Say not thou , What is the cause that the former dayes were better then these ? For thou doest not enquire wisely concerning this .
¶ Wisedome is good with an inheritance : and by it there is profite to them that see the sunne .
For wisedome is a defence , and money is a defence : but the excellencie of knowledge is , that wisedome giueth life to them that haue it .
Consider the worke of God : for who can make that straight , which hee hath made crooked ?
In the day of prosperitie be ioyfull , but in the day of aduersitie consider : God also hath set the one ouer against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
All things haue I seene in the dayes of my vanitie : there is a iust man that perisheth in his righteousnes , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickednes .
Be not righteous ouer much , neither make thy selfe ouer wise : why shouldest thou destroy thy selfe ?
Be not ouermuch wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
It is good that thou shouldest take holde of this , yea also from this withdraw not thine hand : for hee that feareth God , shall come foorth of them all .
Wisedome strengtheneth the wise , more then ten mightie men which are in the citie .
For there is not a iust man vpon earth , that doeth good , and sinneth not .
Also take no heede vnto all words that are spoken ; lest thou heare thy seruant curse thee .
For often times also thine owne heart knoweth , that thou thy selfe likewise hast cursed others .
¶ All this haue I prooued by wisedome : I said , I will be wise , but it was farre from me .
That which is farre off , and exceeding deepe , who can finde it out ?
I applyed mine heart to know , and to search , and to seeke out wisdome , and the reason of things , aud to know the wickednes of folly , euen of foolishnesse and madnesse .
And I finde more bitter then death , the woman whose heart is snares & nets , and her handes as bands : who so pleaseth God , shall escape from her , but the sinner shall be taken by her .
Behold , this haue I found ( saith the Preacher ) counting one by one to finde out the account :
Which yet my soule seeketh , but I finde not : one man among a thousand haue I found , but a woman among all those haue I not found .
<NON-VERSE>
Who is as the Wise man ? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing ? a mans wisedome maketh his face to shine , and the boldnes of his face shalbe changed .
I counsell thee , to keepe the kings commandement , and that in regard of the oath of God .
Bee not hastie to goe out of his sight : stand not in an euill thing , for he doeth whatsoeuer pleaseth him .
Where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say vnto him , What doest thou ?
Whoso keepeth the commandement , shall feele no euill thing : and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and iudgement .
¶ Because to euery purpose there is time , and iudgement ; therefore the misery of man is great vpon him .
For hee knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell him , when it shall be ?
There is no man that hath power ouer the spirit to retaine the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that warre , neither shall wickednesse deliuer those that are giuen to it .
All this haue I seene , and applied my heart vnto euery worke that is done vnder the Sunne : there is a time wherein one man ruleth ouer another to his owne hurt .
And so I saw the wicked buried , who had come , and gone from the place of the Holy , and they were forgotten in the city , where they had so done : this is also vanitie .
Because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily ; therefore the heart of the sonnes of men is fully set in them to doe euill .
¶ Though a sinner doe euill an hundred times , and his dayes be prolonged ; yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that feare God , which feare before him .
But it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall hee prolong his dayes which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before God .
There is a vanitie which is done vpon the earth , that there be iust men vnto whom it happeneth according to the worke of the wicked : againe , there be wicked men , to whom it happeneth according to the worke of the righteous : I said , that this also is vanitie .
Then I commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing vnder the Sunne , then to eate and to drinke , and to be merrie : for that shall abide with him of his labour , the dayes of his life , which God giueth him vnder the Sunne .
¶ When I applied mine heart to know wisedome , and to see the busines that is done vpon the earth : ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleepe with his eyes . )
<NON-VERSE>
For all this I considered in my heart , euen to declare all this , that the righteous , and the wise , and their workes , are in the hand of God : no man knoweth either loue , or hatred , by all that is before them .
All things come alike to all : there is one euent to the righteous and to the wicked , to the good and to the cleane , and to the vncleane ; to him that sacrificeth , and to him that sacrificeth not : as is the good , so is the sinner , and hee that sweareth , as he that feareth an oath .
This is an euill among all things that are done vnder the Sunne , that there is one euent vnto all : yea also the heart of the sonnes of men is full of euill , and madnesse is in their heart while they liue , and after that they goe to the dead .
¶ For to him that is ioyned to all the liuing , there is hope : for a liuing dogge is better then a dead Lion .
For the liuing know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither haue they any more a reward , for the memorie of them is forgotten .
Also their loue , and their hatred , and their enuy is now perished ; neither haue they any more a portion for euer in any thing that is done vnder the Sunne .
¶ Goe thy way , eate thy bread with ioy , and drinke thy wine with a merry heart ; for God now accepteth thy workes .
Let thy garments bee alwayes white ; and let thy head lacke no oyntment .
Liue ioyfully with the wife , whom thou louest , all the dayes of the life of thy vanitie , which he hath giuen thee vnder the Sunne , all the dayes of thy vanitie : for that is thy portion in this life , and in thy labour which thou takest vnder the Sunne .
Whatsoeuer thy hand findeth to doe , doe it with thy might : for there is no worke , nor deuice , nor knowledge , nor wisedome in the graue , whither thou goest .
¶ I returned , and saw vnder the Sunne , That the race is not to the swift , nor the battell to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to men of vnderstanding , nor yet fauour to men of skil ; but time and chance happeneth to them all .
For man also knoweth not his time , as the fishes that are taken in an euil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sonnes of men snared in an euill time , when it falleth suddenly vpon them .
¶ This wisedome haue I seene also vnder the Sunne , and it seemed great vnto me :
There was a little citie , and few men within it ; and there came a great King against it , and besieged it , & built great bulwarks against it :
Now there was found in it a poore wise man , and hee by his wisedome deliuered the citie ; yet no man remembred that same poore man .
Then said I , Wisedome is better then strength : neuerthelesse , the poore mans wisedome is despised , and his words are not heard .
The words of wise men are heard in quiet , more then the cry of him that ruleth among fooles .
Yea also when hee that is a foole walketh by the way , his wisedome faileth him , and hee saith to euery one that he is a foole .
If the spirit of the ruler rise vp against thee , leaue not thy place ; for yeelding pacifieth great offences .
There is an euill which I haue seene vnder the Sunne , as an errour , which proceedeth from the ruler .
Folly is set in great dignitie ; and the rich sit in lowe place .
I haue seene seruants vpon horses , and princes walking as seruants vpon the earth .
He that diggeth a pit , shall fall into it ; and who so breaketh an hedge , a serpent shall bite him .
Who so remoueth stones , shall be hurt therewith : and hee that cleaueth wood , shalbe endangered thereby .
If the yron be blunt , and he doe not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisedome is profitable to direct .
Surely the serpent will bite without inchauntment , and a babbler is no better .
The words of a wise mans mouth are gratious : but the lips of a foole will swallow vp himselfe .
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishnesse : and the end of his talke is mischieuous madnesse .
A foole also is full of words ; a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall bee after him who can tell him ?
The labour of the foolish wearyeth euery one of them ; because hee knoweth not how to goe to the citie .
¶ Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eate in the morning .
Blessed art thou , O land , when thy king is the sonne of nobles , and thy princes eate in due season , for strength , and not for drunkennesse .
¶ By much slouthfulnesse the building decayeth ; and through idlenesse of the hands the house droppeth through .
¶ A feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh merry : but money answereth all things .
<NON-VERSE>
Cast thy bread vpon the waters : for thou shalt find it after many dayes .
Giue a portion to seuen and also to eight ; for thou knowest noc what euill shall be vpon the earth .
If the clouds be full of raine , they emptie themselues vpon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the South , or toward the North , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
He that obserueth the wind , shall not sow : and hee that regardeth the clouds , shall not reape .
As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones doe growe in the wombe of her that is with child : euen so thou knowest not the workes of God who maketh all .
In the morning sowe thy seede , and in the euening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
¶ Truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing is it for the eyes to behold the sunne .
But if a man liue many yeeres , and reioyce in them all ; yet let him remember the dayes of darkenesse , for they shall be many . All that commeth is vanitie .
¶ Reioyce , O young man , in thy youth , and let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth , and walke in the wayes of thine heart , and in the sight of thine eyes : but know thou , that for all these things , God will bring thee into iudgement .
<NON-VERSE>
Remember now thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth , while the euil daies come not , nor the yeeres drawe nigh , when thou shalt say , I haue no pleasure in them :
While the Sunne , or the light , or the moone , or the starres be not darkened , nor the cloudes returne after the raine :
In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bowe themselues , and the grinders cease , because they are fewe , and those that looke out of the windowes be darkened :
And the doores shal be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise vp at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of musicke shall be brought low .
Also when they shalbe afraid of that which is high , and feares shall bee in the way , and the Almond tree shall flourish , and the grashopper shall be a burden , and desire shall faile : because man goeth to his long home , and the mourners goe about the streets :
Or euer the siluer corde be loosed , or the golden bowle be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountaine , or the wheele broken at the cisterne .
Then shall the dust returne to the earth as it was : and the spirit shall returne vnto God who gaue it .
¶ Uanitie of vanities ( saith the preacher ) all is vanitie .
And moreouer because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge , yea he gaue good heed , and sought out , and set in order many prouerbes .
The preacher sought to finde out acceptable words , and that which was written was vpright , euen wordes of trueth .
The wordes of the wise are as goads , and as nailes fastened by the masters of assemblies , which are giuen from one shepheard .
And further , by these , my sonne , be admonished : of making many bookes there is no end , and much studie is a wearinesse of the flesh .
¶ Let vs heare the conclusion of the whole matter : Feare God , and keepe his commandements , for this is the whole duetie of man .
<NON-VERSE>
Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the will of God , to the Saincts which are at Ephesus , and to the faithfull in Christ Iesus .
Grace be to you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Iesus Christ .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ , who hath blessed vs with all spirituall blessings in heauenly places in Christ :
According as he hath chosen vs in him , before the foundation of the world , that wee should bee holy , and without blame before him in loue :
Hauing predestinated vs vnto the adoption of children by Iesus Christ to himselfe , according to the good pleasure of his will :
To the praise of the glorie of his grace , wherein he hath made vs accepted in the beloued :
In whom wee haue redemption through his blood , the forgiuenesse of sinnes , according to the riches of his grace ,
Wherein hee hath abounded toward vs in all wisedome and prudence : Hauing made knowen vnto vs the mysterie of his will , according to his good pleasure , which he had purposed in himselfe ,
That in the dispensation of the fulnesse of times , he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heauen , and which are on earth , euen in him :
In whom also we haue obteined an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will :
That we should be to the praise of his glorie , who first trusted in Christ .
In whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of trueth , the Gospel of your saluation : in whom also after that yee beleeued , yee were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
Which is the earnest of our inheritance , vntill the redemption of the purchased possession , vnto the praise of his glorie .
Wherefore I also , after I heard of your faith in the Lord Iesus , and loue vnto all the Saints ,
Cease not to giue thankes for you , making mention of you in my prayers ,
That the God of our Lord Iesus Christ the Father of glorie , may giue vnto you the Spirit of wisedome and reuelation in the knowledge of him :
The eyes of your vnderstanding being inlightned : that yee may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glorie of his inheritance in the Saints :
And what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power to vs - ward who beleeue , according to the working of his mightie power :
Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his owne right hand in the heauenly places ,
Farre aboue all principalitie , and power , and might , and dominion , and euery name that is named , not onely in this world , but also in that which is to come :
And hath put all things vnder his feete , and gaue him to be the head ouer all things to the Church ,
<NON-VERSE>
And you hath hee quickned who were dead in trespasses , and sinnes ,
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the aire , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience ,
Among whom also we all had our conuersation in times past , in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh , and of the minde , and were by nature the children of wrath , euen as others :
But God who is rich in mercie , for his great loue wherewith hee loued vs ,
Euen when wee were dead in sinnes , hath quickned vs together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saued )
And hath raised vs vp together , and made vs sit together in heauenly places in Christ Iesus :
That in the ages to come , hee might shew the exceeding riches of his grace , in his kindenesse towards vs , through Christ Iesus .
For by grace are ye saued , through faith , and that not of your selues : it is the gift of God :
Not of workes , lest any man should boast .
For wee are his workemanship , created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes , which God hath before ordeined , that we should walke in them .
Wherefore remember that ye being in time passed Gentiles in the flesh , who are called vncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands ,
That at that time yee were without Christ , being aliens from the common wealth of Israel , and strangers from the couenants of promise , hauing no hope , & without God in the world .
But now in Christ Iesus , ye who sometimes were far off , are made nigh by the blood of Christ .
For hee is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken downe the middle wall of partition betweene vs :
Hauing abolished in his flesh the enmitie , euen the Lawe of Commandements conteined in Ordinances , for to make in himselfe , of twaine , one newe man , so making peace .
And that he might reconcile both vnto God in one body by the crosse , hauing slaine the enmitie thereby ,
And came , and preached peace to you , which were afarre off , and to them that were nigh .
For through him wee both haue an accesse by one Spirit vnto the Father .
Now therefore yee are no more strangers and forreiners ; but fellow citizens with the Saints , and of the houshold of God ,
And are built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets , Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone ,
In whom all the building fitly framed together , groweth vnto an holy Temple in the Lord :
<NON-VERSE>
For this cause I Paul , the prisoner of Iesus Christ for you Gentiles ,
If ye haue heard of the dispensation of the grace of God , which is giuen me to youward :
How that by reuelation hee made knowen vnto me the mysterie , ( as I wrote afore in few words ,
Whereby when ye reade , ye may vnderstand my knowledge in the mysterie of Christ . )
Which in other ages was not made knowen vnto the sonnes of men , as it is now reueiled vnto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit ,
That the Gentiles should be fellow heires , and of the same body , and partakers of his promise in Christ , by the Gospel :
Whereof I was made a Minister , according to the gift of the grace of God giuen vnto mee , by the effectuall working of his power .
Unto mee , who am lesse then the least of all Saints , is this grace giuen , that I should preach among the Gentiles the vnsearchable riches of Christ ,
And to make all men see , what is the fellowship of the mysterie , which from the beginning of the world , hath bene hid in God , who created all things by Iesus Christ :
To the intent that now vnto the principalities and powers in heauenly places , might be knowen by the church , the manifold wisedome of God ,
According to the eternall purpose which he purposed in Christ Iesus our Lord :
For this cause I bow my knees vnto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ ,
Of whom the whole family in heauen and earth is named ,
That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory , to bee strengthened with might , by his Spirit in the inner man ,
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith , that yee being rooted and grounded in loue ,
May be able to comprehend with all Saints , what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height :
And to know the loue of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that yee might bee filled with all the fulnesse of God .
Now vnto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly aboue all that wee aske or thinke , according to the power that worketh in vs ,
<NON-VERSE>
I therefore the prisoner of the Lord , beseech you that yee walke worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called ,
With all lowlinesse and meekenesse , with long suffering , forbearing one another in loue .
Endeuouring to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
There is one body , and one spirit , euen as yee are called in one hope of your calling .
One Lord , one Faith , one Baptisme ,
One God and Father of all , who is aboue all , & through all , & in you all .
But vnto euery one of vs is giuen grace , according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
Wherefore he saith : When he ascended vp on high , he led captiuitie captiue , and gaue gifts vnto men .
( Now that he ascended , what is it but that hee also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
He that descended , is the same also that ascended vp far aboue all heauens , that he might fill all things . )
And he gaue some , Apostles : and some , Prophets : and some , Euangelists : and some , Pastors , and teachers :
For the perfecting of the Saints , for the worke of the ministerie , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
Till we all come in the vnitie of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God , vnto a perfect man , vnto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ :
That we hencefoorth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and caried about with euery winde of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftinesse , whereby they lye in waite to deceiue :
But speaking the trueth in loue , may grow vp into him in all things which is the head , euen Christ :
From whom the whole body fitly ioyned together , and compacted by that which euery ioynt supplyeth , according to the effectuall working in the measure of euery part , maketh increase of the body , vnto the edifying of it selfe in loue .
This I say therefore and testifie in the Lord , that yee henceforth walke not as other Gentiles walke in the vanitie of their minde ,
Hauing the vnderstanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God , through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindnesse of their heart :
Who being past feeling , haue giuen themselues ouer vnto lasciuiousnesse , to worke all vncleannesse with greedinesse .
But ye haue not so learned Christ :
If so be that ye haue heard him , and haue bene taught by him , as the trueth is in Iesus ,
That yee put off concerning the former conuersation , the olde man , which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts :
And bee renewed in the spirit of your minde :
And that yee put on that new man , which after God is created in righteousnesse , and true holinesse .
Wherefore putting away lying , speake euery man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
Be ye angry and sinne not , let not the Sunne go down vpon your wrath :
Neither giue place to the deuill .
Let him that stole , steale no more : but rather let him labour , working with his handes the thing which is good , that he may haue to giue to him that needeth .
Let no corrupt communication proceede out of your mouth , but that which is good to the vse of edifying , that it may minister grace vnto the hearers .
And grieue not the holy Sririt of God , whereby yee are sealed vnto the day of redemption .
Let all bitternes , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and euill speaking , be put away from you , with all malice ,
<NON-VERSE>
Be ye therefore followers of God , as deare children .
And walke in loue , as Christ also hath loued vs , and hath giuen himselfe for vs , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling sauour ;
But fornication and all vncleannesse , or couetousnesse , let it not be once named amongst you , as becommeth Saints :
Neither filthinesse , nor foolish talking , nor iesting , which are not conuenient : but rather giuing of thankes .
For this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor vncleane person , nor couetous man who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ , and of God .
Let no man deceiue you with vaine words : for because of these things commeth the wrath of God vpon the children of disobedience .
Bee not yee therefore partakers with them .
Proouing what is acceptable vnto the Lord :
But all things that are reprooued , are made manifest by the light : for whatsoeuer doth make manifest , is light .
Wherfore hee saith : Awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall giue thee light .
See then that yee walke circumspectly , not as fooles , but as wise ,
Redeming the time , because the dayes are euill .
Wherefore be ye not vnwise , but vnderstanding what the will of the Lord is .
And bee not drunke with wine , wherein is excesse : but bee filled with the Spirit :
Speaking to your selues , in Psalmes , and Hymnes , and Spirituall songs , singing and making melodie in your heart to the Lord ,
Giuing thankes alwayes for all things vnto God , and the Father , in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ ,
Submitting your selues one to another in the feare of God .
Wiues , submit your selues vnto your own husbands , as vnto the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife , euen as Christ is the head of the Church : and he is the sauiour of the body .
Therefore as the Church is subiect vnto Christ , so let the wiues bee to their owne husbands in euery thing .
Husbands , loue your wiues , euen as Christ also loued the Church , and gaue himselfe for it :
That he might sanctifie & cleanse it with the washing of water , by the word ,
That hee might present it to himselfe a glorious Church , not hauing spot or wrinckle , or any such thing : but that it should bee holy and without blemish .
So ought men to loue their wiues , as their owne bodies : hee that loueth his wife , loueth himselfe .
For no man euer yet hated his owne flesh : but nourisheth and cherisheth it , euen as the Lord the Church :
For we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother , and shall be ioyned vnto his wife , and they two shalbe one flesh .
This is a great mysterie : but I speake concerning Christ and the Church .
<NON-VERSE>
Children , obey your parents in the Lord : for this is right .
Honour thy father and mother , ( which is the first commandement with promise , )
That it may bee well with thee , and thou maiest liue long on the earth .
Not with eye seruice as men pleasers , but as the seruants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart :
With good will doing seruice , as to the Lord , and not to men ,
Knowing that whatsoeuer good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receiue of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
And ye masters , do the same things vnto them , forbearing threatning : knowing that your master also is in heauen , neither is there respect of persons with him .
Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , & in the power of his might .
Put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the deuill .
For wee wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darknes of this world , against spirituall wickednes in high places .
Wherfore take vnto you the whole armour of God , that yee may be able to withstand in the euill day , and hauing done all , to stand .
Stand therefore , hauing your loynes girt about with trueth , and hauing on the breast - plate of righteousnesse :
And your feete shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace .
Aboue all , taking the shielde of Faith , wherewith yee shall bee able to quench all the fierie dartes of the wicked .
And take the helmet of saluation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
Praying alwayes with all prayer and supplication in the spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseuerance , and supplication for all Saints ,

For which I am an ambassador in bonds , that therein I may speake boldly , as I ought to speake .
But that yee also may know my affaires , and how I doe , Tychicus a beloued brother , and faithfull minister in the Lord , shall make knowen to you all things .
Whom I haue sent vnto you for the same purpose , that yee might know our affaires , and that he might comfort your hearts .
Peace be to the brethren , and loue , with faith from God the Father , and the Lord Iesus Christ .

Now it came to passe in the dayes of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned from India , euen vnto Ethiopia , ouer an hundred , and seuen and twentie prouinces . ) That in those dayes , when the King Ahasuerus sate on the throne of his kingdome , which was in Shushan the palace :
In the third yeere of his reigne , he made a feast vnto all his Princes , and his seruants , the power of Persia and Media , the Nobles and Princes of the prouinces being before him .
When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdome , and the honour of his excellent maiestie , many dayes , euen an hundred and fourescore dayes .
And when these dayes were expired , the king made a feast vnto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both vnto great and small , seuen dayes , in the court of the garden of the kings palace ,
Where were white , greene and blew hangings , fastened with cords of fine linnen , and purple , to siluer rings , and pillers of marble : the beds were of gold and siluer , vpon a pauement of red , and blewe , and white , and blacke marble .
And they gaue them drinke in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diuers one from another ) and royall wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
And the drinking was according to the law , none did compell : for the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should doe according to euery mans pleasure .
Also Uasthi the Queene made a feast for the women , in the royall house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
¶ On the seuenth day , when the heart of the King was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seuen chamberlens that serued in the presence of Ahasuerus the king ,
To bring Uasthi the Queene before the king , with the Crowne royall , to shew the people , and the Princes her beautie : for she was faire to looke on .
But the Queene Uasthi refused to come at the Kings commandement by his chamberlens : therefore was the King very wroth , and his anger burned in him .
¶ Then the king saide to the wise men , which knew the times ( for so was the Kings maner towards all that knew law , and iudgement :
And the next vnto him , was Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshis , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan , the seuen Princes of Persia , and Media , which saw the Kings face , and which sate the first in the kingdome . )
What shall wee doe vnto the Queene Uasthi , according to law , because she hath not performed the commandement of the king Ahasuerus , by the chamberlens ?
And Memucan answered before the king and the Princes ; Uasthi the Queene hath not done wrong to the king onely , but also to all the Princes , and to all the people that are in all the prouinces of the king Ahasuerus .
For this deed of the queene shall come abroad vnto all women , so that they shal despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall bee reported ; The king Ahasuerus commanded Uasthi the queene to be brought in before him , but she came not .
Likewise shall the Ladies of Persia and Media say this day vnto all the kings princes , which haue heard of the deed of the Queene . Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
If it please the king , let there go a royall commandement from him , and let it bee written among the lawes of the Persians , and the Medes , that it be not altered , that Uasthi come no more before king Ahasuerus , and let the king giue her royall estate vnto another that is better then she .
And when the kings decree , which he shal make , shalbe published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great : ) all the wiues shall giue to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
And the saying pleased the king and the princes , and the king did according to the word of Memucan :
<NON-VERSE>
After these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased , hee remembred Uasthi , and what shee had done , and what was decreed against her .
Then saide the kings seruants , that ministred vnto him , Let there bee faire yong virgins sought for the king :
And let the king appoint officers in all the prouinces of his kingdome , that they may gather together all the faire yong virgins vnto Shushan the palace , to the house of the women vnto the custodie of Hege the kings chamberlaine , keeper of the women , and let their things for purification bee giuen them :
And let the maiden which pleaseth the king , bee Queene in stead of Uasthi . And the thing pleased the king , and he did so .
¶ Now in Shushan the palace , there was a certaine Iew , whose name was Mordecai , the sonne of Iair , the sonne of Shimei , the sonne of Kish , a Beniamite ,
Who had bene caried away from Ierusalem , with the captiuitie which had bene caried away with Ieconiah king of Iudah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon had caried away .
And hee brought vp Hadassah ( that is Esther ) his vncles daughter , for she had neither father nor mother , and the maid was faire and beautiful , whom Mordecai ( when her father and mother were dead ) tooke for his owne daughter .
¶ So it came to passe , when the kings commandement and his decree was heard , and when many maidens were gathered together vnto Shushan the palace , to the custodie of Hegai , that Esther was brought also vnto the kings house , to the custodie of Hegai , keeper of the women .
And the maiden pleased him , and she obtained kindnesse of him , and hee speedily gaue her her things for purification , with such things as belonged to her , and seuen maidens , which were meet to be giuen her , out of the Kings house , and hee preferred her and her maids , vnto the best place of the house of the women .
Esther had not shewed her people , nor her kinred : for Mordecai had charged her , that she should not shew it .
And Mordecai walked euery day before the court of the womens house , to know how Esther did , and what should become of her .
¶ Now when euery maids turne was come , to goe in to King Ahasnerus , after that shee had bene twelue moneths , according to the maner of the women ( for so were the dayes of their purifications accomplished , to wit , sixe moneths with oile of myrrhe , and sixe moneths with sweet odours , and with other things for the purifying of the women . )
Then thus came euery maiden vnto the king , whatsoeuer she desired , was giuen her , to goe with her out of the house of the women , vnto the kings house .
In the euening she went , and on the morrowe she returned into the second house of the women , to the custodie of Shaashgaz the kings chamberlen , which kept the concubines : shee came in vnto the king no more , except the king delighted in her , and that shee were called by name .
¶ Now when the turne of Esther , the daughter of Abihail , the vncle of Mordecai ( who had taken her for his daughter ) was come , to goe in vnto the king : she required nothing , but what Hegai the kings chamberlen the keeper of the women , appointed : And Esther obtained fauour in the sight of all them that looked vpon her .
So Esther was taken vnto king Ahasuerus , into his house royall , in the tenth moneth ( which is the moneth Tebeth ) in the seuenth yeere of his reigne .
And the king loued Esther aboue all the women , and she obtained grace and fauour in his sight , more then all the virgins ; so that hee set the royall crowne vpon her head , and made her queene , in stead of Uasthi .
Then the king made a great feast vnto all his princes and his seruants , euen Esthers feast , and hee made a release to the prouinces , and gaue gifts , according to the state of the king .
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then Mordecai sate in the kings gate .
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred , nor her people , as Mordecai had charged her : For Esther did the commandement of Mordecai , like as when she was brought vp with him .
¶ In those dayes , ( while Mordecai sate in the kings gate ) two of the kings chamberlens , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the doore , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus :
And the thing was knowen to Mordecai , who told it vnto Esther the Queene , and Esther certified the king thereof , in Mordecais name .
<NON-VERSE>
After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman , the sonne of Amedatha the Agagite , and aduanced him , and set his seate aboue all the princes that were with him .
And all the kings seruants , that were in the kings gate , bowed , and reuerenced Haman , for the king had so commanded concerning him : but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reuerence .
Then the kings seruants , which were in the kings gate , sayd vnto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the kings commandement ?
Now it came to passe , when they spake daily vnto him , and he hearkened not vnto them ; that they told Haman , to see whether Mordecai his matters would stand , for he had told them that he was a Iewe .
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reuerence , then was Haman full of wrath .
And hee thought scorne to lay hands on Mordecai alone , for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Iewes , that were throughout the whole kingdome of Ahasuerus , euen the people of Mordecai .
¶ In the first moneth ( that is , the moneth Nisan ) in the twelfth yeere of king Ahasuerus , they cast Pur , that is , the lot , before Haman , from day to day , and from moneth to moneth , to the twelfth moneth , that is the moneth Adar .
¶ And Haman saide vnto king Ahasuerus : There is a certaine people scattered abroad , and dispersed among the people , in all the prouinces of thy kingdome , and their lawes are diuerse from all people , neither keepe they the kings lawes ; therefore it is not for the kings profit to suffer them .
If it please the king , let it be written , that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand talents of siluer to the handes of those that haue the charge of the businesse , to bring it into the kings treasuries .
And the king tooke his ring from his hand , and gaue it vnto Haman the sonne of Ammedatha the Agagite , the Iewes enemie .
And the king saide vnto Haman , The siluer is giuen to thee , the people also , to doe with them , as it seemeth good to thee .
Then were the kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first moneth , and there was written , according to all that Haman had commanded , vnto the kings Lieutenants , and to the gouernours , that were ouer euery prouince , and to the rulers of euery people of euery prouince , according to the writing thereof , and to euery people , after their language , in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written , and sealed with the kings ring .
And the letters were sent by posts into all the kings prouinces , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish all Iewes , both yong and olde , litle children and women , in one day , euen vpon the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth ( which is the moneth Adar ) and to take the spoile of them for a pray .
The copie of the writing for a commandement to bee giuen in euery prouince , was published vnto all people , that they should bee ready against that day .
<NON-VERSE>
When Mordecai perceiued all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the citie , and cried with a loud and a bitter crie :
And came euen before the kings gate : for none might enter into the kings gate clothed with sackcloth .
And in euery prouince , whithersoeuer the kings commaundement , and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Iewes , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing , and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
¶ So Esthers maides and her chamberlaines came , and told it her : then was the Queene exceedingly grieued , and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away the sackcloth from him : but he receiued it not .
Then called Esther for Hatach , one of the kings chamberlaines , whom he had appointed to attend vpon her , and gaue him a commaundement to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai , vnto the street of the citie , which was before the kings gate :
And Mordecai tolde him of all that had happened vnto him , and of the summe of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the Kings treasuries for the Iewes , to destroy them .
Also he gaue him the copie of the writing of the decree , that was giuen at Shushan to destroy them , to shewe it vnto Esther , and to declare it vnto her , and to charge her that she should goe in vnto the king , to make supplication vnto him , and to make request before him , for her people . And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai .
¶ Againe Esther spake vnto Hatach , and gaue him commaundement vnto Mordecai ;
All the Kings seruants , and the people of the kings prouinces do know , that whosoeuer , whether man or woman , shall come vnto the King into the inner court , who is not called , there is one lawe of his to put him to death , except such to whom the King shall hold out the golden scepter , that he may liue : but I haue not beene called to come in vnto the King , these thirtie dayes .
And they tolde to Mordecai Esthers words .
Then Mordecai commanded to answere Esther ; Thinke not with thy selfe that thou shalt escape in the kings house , more then all the Iewes .
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall there enlargement and deliuerance arise to the Iewes from another place , but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed : And who knoweth , whether thou art come to the kingdome for such a time as this ?
¶ Then Esther bade them returne Mordecai this answere :
Goe , gather together all the Iewes that are present in Shushan , and fast yee for me , and neither eate nor drinke three dayes , night or day : I also and my maidens will fast likewise , and so will I goe in vnto the king , which is not according to the Law , and if I perish , I perish .
<NON-VERSE>
Now it came to passe on the third day , that Esther put on her royall apparell , and stood in the inner court of the kings house , ouer against the kings house : and the King sate vpon his royall throne in the royall house , ouer against the gate of the house .
And it was so , when the king saw Esther the Queene standing in the court , that shee obtained fauour in his sight : and the king helde out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand : So Esther drew neere , and touched the top of the scepter .
Then sayd the King vnto her , What wilt thou , Queene Esther ? and what is thy request ? it shall bee euen giuen thee to the halfe of the kingdome .
And Esther answered , If it seeme good vnto the King , let the King and Haman come this day vnto the banquet that I haue prepared for him .
Then the King sayd , Cause Haman to make haste , that he may doe as Esther hath said : So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
¶ And the king said vnto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , and it shall be granted thee ? and what is thy request ? euen to the halfe of the kingdome it shall be performed .
Then answered Esther , and said , My petition , and my request is ,
If I haue found fauour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to performe my request , let the king , and Haman , come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I wil do to morow , as the king hath said .
¶ Then went Haman foorth that day , ioyfull , and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the kings gate , that hee stood not vp , nor mooued for him , hee was full of indignation against Mordecai .
Neuerthelesse Haman refrained himselfe , and when he came home , hee sent and called for his friends , and Zeresh his wife .
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had aduanced him aboue the Princes , and seruants of the king .
Haman said moreouer , Yea Esther the Queene did let no man come in with the king vnto the banquet that she had prepared , but my selfe ; and to morrow am I inuited vnto her also with the king .
Yet all this auaileth me nothing , so long as I see Mordecai the Iew sitting at the kings gate .
<NON-VERSE>
On that night could not the King sleepe , and hee commaunded to bring the booke of Records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
And it was found written , that Mordecai had told of Bigthana , and Teresh , two of the kings chamberleus , the keepers of the doore , who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
And the king said , What honour and dignitie hath bene done to Mordecai for this ? Then said the kings seruants that ministred vnto him , There is nothing done for him .
¶ And the king said , Who is in the court ? ( now Haman was come into the outward court of the kings house , to speake vnto the king , to hang Mordecai on the gallons that hee had prepared for him . )
And Haman answered the king , For the man whom the king delighteth to honour ,
Let the royall apparell bee brought , which the King vseth to weare , and the horse that the King rideth vpon , and the crowne royal which is set vpon his head :
And let this apparell and horse bee deliuered to the hand of one of the kings most noble Princes , that they may aray the man withall , whom the king delighteth to honour , and bring him on horsebacke through the streete of the city , and proclaime before him , Thus shal it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
Then the king saide to Haman , Make haste , and take the apparell , and the horse , as thou hast said , and doe euen so to Mordecai the Iew , that sitteth at the Kings gate : let nothing faile of all that thou hast spoken .
Then tooke Haman the apparell , and the horse , & arayed Mordecai , and brought him on hors - backe through the streete of the city , and proclaimed before him : Thus shall it bee done vnto the man whom the King delighteth to honour .
¶ And Mordecai came againe to the kings gate : but Haman hasted to his house , mourning , and hauing his head couered .
And Haman told Zeresh his wife , and all his friends , euery thing that had befallen him . Then saide his wise men , and Zeresh his wife vnto him , If Mordecai be of the seed of the Iewes , before whom thou hast begun to fall , thou shalt not preuaile against him , but shalt surely fall before him .
<NON-VERSE>
So the King and Haman came to banquet with Esther the Queene .
And the king said againe vnto Esther , on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , Queene Esther , and it shalbe granted thee ? and what is thy request ? and it shall bee performed , euen to the halfe of the kingdome .
Then Esther the Queene answered , and said ; If I haue found fauour in thy sight , O King , and if it please the King , let my life be giuen me at my petition , and my people at my request .
For we are sold , I , and my people , to be destroyed , to be slaine , and to perish : but if we had bene sold for bondmen , and bondwomen , I had held my tongue , although the enemy could not counteruaile the kings dammage .
¶ Then the king Ahasuerus answered , & said vnto Esther the Queene : Who is he ? and where is he , that durst presume in his heart to do so ?
And Esther said , The aduersary and enemie , is this wicked Haman . Then Haman was afraid before the King and the Queene .
¶ And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath , went into the palace garden : and Haman stood vp to make request for his life to Esther the Queene : for he saw that there was euill determined against him by the King .
Then the king returned out of the palace garden , into the place of the banquet of wine , and Haman was fallen vpon the bed whereon Esther was . Then said the King , Will hee force the Queene also before me in the house ? As the word went out of the Kings mouth , they couered Hamans face .
And Harbonah one of the chamberlaines , said before the king ; Behold also the gallowes , fiftie cubites high , which Haman had made for Mordecai , who had spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of Haman . Then the king said , Hang him thereon .
<NON-VERSE>
On that day did the King Ahasuerus giue the house of Haman , the Iewes enemy , vnto Esther the Queene ; and Mordecai came before the King ; for Esther hade told what he was vnto her .
And the king tooke off his Ring which he had taken from Haman , and gaue it vnto Mordecai . And Esther set Mordecai ouer the house of Haman .
¶ And Esther spake yet againe before the king , and fell downe at his feet , and besought him with teares , to put away the mischiefe of Haman the Agagite , and his deuice , that he had deuised against the Iewes .
Then the king helde out the golden scepter toward Esther . So Esther arose , and stood before the king ,
And said , If it please the king , and if I haue found fauour in his sight , and the thing seeme right before the king , and I bee pleasing in his eyes , let it be written to reuerse the letters deuised by Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite , which hee wrote to destroy the Iewes , which are in all the kings prouinces .
For how can I endure to see the euill that shall come vnto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kinred ?
¶ Then the king Ahasuerus said vnto Esther the Queene , and to Mordecai the Iewe , Behold , I haue giuen Esther the house of Haman , and him they haue hanged vpon the gallowes , because hee layde his hand vpon the Iewes .
Write ye also for the Iewes , as it liketh you , in the Kings name , and seale it with the Kings ring : for the writing which is written in the Kings name , and sealed with the Kings ring , may no man reuerse .
Then were the kings scribes called at that time , in the third moneth , ( that is , the month Siuan ) on the three and twentieth day thereof , and it was written ( according to all that Mordecai commanded ) vnto the Iewes , and to the Lieutenants , and the deputies and rulers of the prouinces , which are from India vnto Ethiopia , an hundred , twentie and seuen prouinces , vnto euery prouince according to the writing thereof , and vnto euery people after their language , and to the Iewes , according to their writing , and according to their language .
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus name , and sealed it with the kings Ring , and sent letters by Postes , on horsebacke , and riders on mules , camels , and yong dromedaries :
Wherein the King granted the Iewes , which were in euery citie , to gather themselues together , and to stand for their life , to destroy , to slay , and to cause to perish all the power of the people and prouince that would assault them , both little ones , and women , and to take the spoile of them for a pray :
Upon one day , in all the prouinces of king Ahasuerus , namely vpon the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth , which is the moneth Adar .
The copy of the writing , for a commandement to bee giuen in euery prouince , was published vnto all people , and that the Iewes should be readie against that day , to auenge themselues on their enemies .
So the posts that rode vpon mules and camels went out , being hastened , and pressed on by the kings commandement , and the decree was giuen at Shushan the palace .
¶ And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king , in royall apparell , of blew and white , and with a great crowne of gold , and with a garment of fine linnen , and purple , and the citie of Shushan reioyced , and was glad :
The Iewes had light and gladnesse , and ioy and honour .
<NON-VERSE>
Now in the twelfth month ( that is the moneth Adar ) on the thirteenth day of the same , when the Kings commaundement and his decree drew neere to bee put in execution , in the day that the enemies of the Iewes hoped to haue power ouer them : ( though it was turned to the contrary , that the Iewes had rule ouer them that hated them . )
The Iewes gathered themselues together in their cities , throughout all the prouinces of the king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt , and no man could withstand them : for the feare of them fell vpon all people .
And all the rulers of the prouinces , and the Lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Iewes : because the feare of Mordecai fell vpon them .
For Mordecai was great in the kings house , and his fame went out , throughout all the prouinces : for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater .
Thus the Iewes smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would vnto those that hated them .
And in Shushan the palace the Iewes slew and destroyed fiue hundred men :
And Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha , And Poratha , and Adalia , and Aridatha ,
And Parmashta , and Arisai , and Aridai , and Uaiezatha ,
The ten sonnes of Haman the sonne of Hammedatha , the enemie of the Iewes , slew they , but on the spoile laid they not their hand .
On that day , the number of those that were slaine in Shushan the palace , was brought before the king .
¶ And the king said vnto Esther the Queene ; The Iewes haue slaine and destroied fiue hundred men in Shushan the palace , & the ten sonnes of Haman ; what haue they done in the rest of the kings prouinces ? now what is thy petition ? and it shalbe granted thee : or what is thy request further ? and it shall be done .
Then said Esther , If it please the king , Let it bee granted to the Iewes which are in Shushan , to doe to morow also , according vnto this dayes decree , and let Hamans ten sonnes be hanged vpon the gallous .
And the king commanded it so to be done ; and the decree was giuen at Shushan , and they hanged Hamans ten sonnes .
For the Iewes that were in Shushan , gathered themselues together on the fourteenth day also of the moneth Adar , and slewe three hundred men at Shushan : but on the pray they laid not their hand . But the other Iewes that were in the kings prouinces , gathered themselues together , & stood for their liues , and had rest from their enemies , and slew of their foes seuenty and fiue thousand , but they laid not their handes on the pray .
On the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar , and on the fourteenth day of the same , rested they , and made it a day of feasting and gladnes .
But the Iewes that were at Shushan , assembled together on the thirteenth day therof , and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same , they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladnesse .
Therefore the Iewes of the villages , that dwelt in the vnwalled townes , made the foureteenth day of the moneth Adar , a day of gladnesse and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
¶ And Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters vnto all the Iewes , that were in all the prouinces of the king Ahasuerus , both nigh & farre ,
To stablish this among them , that they should keepe the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yeerely :
As the dayes wherein the Iewes rested from their enemies , & the moneth which was turned vnto them , from sorrow to ioy , and from mourning into a good day : that they should make them daies of feasting and ioy , and of sending portions one to another , and gifts to the poore .
And the Iewes vndertooke to doe , as they had begun , and as Mordecai had written vnto them :
Because Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite , the enemie of all the Iewes , had deuised against the Iewes to destroy them , and had cast Pur ( that is , the lot ) to consume them , and to destroy them .
But when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters , that his wicked deuice which he deuised against the Iewes , should returne vpon his owne head , and that he and his sonnes , should be hanged on the gallous .
Wherefore they called these dayes Purim , after the name of Pur : therefore for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seene concerning this matter , and which had come vnto them ,
The Iewes ordeined , and tooke vpon them , and vpon their seed , and vpon all such as ioyned themselues vnto them , so as it should not faile , that they would keepe these two dayes , according to their writing , and according to their appointed time , euery yeere :
And that these dayes should be remembred , and kept throughout euery generation , euery family , euery prouince , and euery citie , and that these dayes of Purim should not faile from among the Iewes , nor the memoriall of them perish from their seed .
Then Esther the Queene , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Iew , wrote with all authoritie , to confirme this second letter of Purim .
And hee sent the letters vnto all the Iewes , to the hundred , twentie and seuen prouinces of the kingdome of Ahasuerus , with wordes of peace and trueth :
To confirme these dayes of Purim , in their times appointed , according as Mordecai the Iew , and Esther the Queene had enioyned them , and as they had decreed for themselues and for their seed , the matters of the fastings and their cry .

And the king Ahasuerus layde a tribute vpon the land , and vpon the Isles of the sea .
And all the actes of his power , and of his might , and the declaration of the greatnesse of Mordecai , whereunto the king aduanced him , are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?

Nowe these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , euery man & his household , came with Iacob . Reuben , Simeon , Leui , and Iudah ,
Issachar , Zebulun and Beniamin ,
Dan , and Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
And all the soules that came out of the loynes of Iacob , were seuentie soules : for Ioseph was in Egypt already .
And Ioseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
¶ And the children of Israel were fruitfull , and increased aboundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty , and the land was filled with them .
Now there arose vp a new King ouer Egypt , which knew not Ioseph .
And he said vnto his people , Behold , the people of the children of Israel are moe and mightier then we .
Come on , let vs deale wisely with them , lest they multiply , and it come to passe that when there falleth out any warre , they ioyne also vnto our enemies , and fight against vs , and so get them vp out of the land .
Therefore they did set ouer them task - masters , to afflict them with their burdens : And they built for Pharaoh treasure - cities , Pithom and Raamses . But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew : and they were grieued because of the children of Israel .
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serue with rigour .
And they made their liues bitter , with hard bondage , in morter and in bricke , and in all maner of seruice in the fielde : all their seruice wherein they made them serue , was with rigour .
¶ And the King of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwiues , ( of which the name of one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah . )
And he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew - women , and see them vpon the stooles , if it be a sonne , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then shee shall liue .
But the midwiues feared God , and did not as the King of Egypt commanded them , but saued the men children aliue .
And the King of Egypt called for the midwiues , & said vnto them , Why haue ye done this thing , and haue saued the men children aliue ?
And the midwiues said vnto Pharaoh , Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women : for they are liuely , and are deliuered ere the midwiues come in vnto them .
Therefore God dealt well with the midwiues : and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty .
And it came to passe , because the midwiues feared God , that hee made them houses .

And there went a man of the house of Leui , & tooke to wife a daughter of Leui .
And the woman conceiued , and bare a sonne : and when shee saw him that hee was a goodly childe , shee hid him three moneths .
And when shee could not longer hide him , she tooke for him an arke of bul - rushes , and daubed it with slime , and with pitch , and put the childe therein , and shee layd it in the flags by the riuers brinke .
And his sister stood afarre off , to wit what would be done to him .
¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came downe to wash her selfe at the riuer , and her maydens walked along by the riuer side : and when shee saw the arke among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
And when she had opened it , she saw the childe : and beholde , the babe wept . And she had compassion on him , and said , This is one of the Hebrewes children .
Then said his sister to Pharaohs daughter , Shall I goe , and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew - women , that she may nurse the childe for thee ?
And Pharaohs daughter said to her , Goe : And the mayd went and called the childs mother .
And Pharaohs daughter said vnto her , Take this child away , and nurse it for me , and I will giue thee thy wages . And the woman tooke the childe , and nursed it .
And the childe grew , and shee brought him vnto Pharaohs daughter , and he became her sonne . And she called his name Moses : And she said , Because I drew him out of the water .
¶ And it came to passe in those dayes , when Moses was growen , that he went out vnto his brethren , and looked on their burdens , and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
And he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
And when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrewes stroue together : And hee said to him that did the wrong , Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
And he said , Who made thee a Prince and a iudge ouer vs ? intendest thou to kill me , as thou killedst the Egyptian ? And Moses feared , and said , Surely this thing is knowen .
Now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sate downe by a well .
Now the Priest of Midian had seuen daughters , and they came and drew water , and filled the troughes to water their fathers flocke .
And the shepheards came and droue them away : but Moses stood vp and helped them , & watred their flocke .
And when they came to Reuel their father , he said , How is it that you are come so soone to day ?
And they said , An Egyptian deliuered vs out of the hand of the shepheards , and also drew water enough for vs , and watered the flocke .
And he said vnto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that yee haue left the man ? Call him , that hee may eate bread .
And Moses was content to dwel with the man , and he gaue Moses Zipporah his daughter .
And she bare him a sonne , and he called his name Gershom : for he said , I haue bene a stranger in a strange land .
¶ And it came to passe in processe of time , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came vp vnto God , by reason of the bondage .

Nowe Moses kept the flocke of Iethro his father in law , the Priest of Midian : and hee led the flocke to the backeside of the desert , and came to the mountaine of God , euen to Horeb .
And the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him , in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush , and he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
And Moses saide , I will nowe turne aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
And when the Lord sawe that he turned aside to see , God called vnto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . And he saide , Here am I .
And he said , Drawe not nigh hither : put off thy shooes from off thy feete , for the place whereon thou standest , is holy ground .
Moreouer hee said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Iacob . And Moses hid his face : for he was afraid to looke vpon God .
¶ And the Lord said , I haue surely seene the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and haue heard their crie , by reason of their taske - masters : for I know their sorrowes ,
And I am come downe to deliuer them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them vp out of that land , vnto a good land and a large , vnto a lande flowing with milke and hony , vnto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hiuites , and the Iebusites .
Now therefore behold , the crie of the children of Israel is come vnto me : and I haue also seene the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppresse them .
Come now therefore , and I will send thee vnto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
¶ And Moses saide vnto God , Who am I , that I should goe vnto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
And God saide vnto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : And he said , Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me vnto you .
And God said moreouer vnto Moses , Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel ; The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Iacob hath sent me vnto you : this is my name for euer , and this is my memoriall vnto all generations .
Goe and gather the Elders of Israel together , and say vnto them , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Iacob appeared vnto me , saying , I haue surely visited you , and seene that which is done to you in Egypt .
And I haue said , I will bring you vp out of the affliction of Egypt , vnto the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hiuites , and the Iebusites , vnto a land flowing with milke and hony .
And they shall hearken to thy voyce : and thou shalt come , thou and the Elders of Israel vnto the King of Egypt , and you shall say vnto him , The Lord God of the Hebrewes hath met with vs : and now let vs goe , ( wee beseech thee ) three dayes iourney into the wildernes , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God .
¶ And I am sure that the King of Egypt will not let you goe , no not by a mightie hand .
And I will stretch out my hand , and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will doe in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you goe .

And he said , Cast it on the ground : And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent : and Moses fled from before it .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the taile : And he put foorth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
That they may beleeue that the Lord God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Iacob hath appeared vnto thee .
¶ And the Lord said furthermore vnto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosome . And he put his hand into his bosome : and when hee tooke it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snowe .
And he said , Put thine hand into thy bosome againe . And hee put his hand into his bosome againe , and plucked it out of his bosome , and behold , it was turned againe as his other flesh .
And it shall come to passe , if they wil not beleeue thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first signe , that they will beleeue the voice of the latter signe .

¶ And Moses saide vnto the Lord , O my lord , I am not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast spoken vnto thy seruant : but I am slow of speach , and of a slow tongue .
And the Lord said vnto him , Who hath made mans mouth ? or who maketh the dumbe or deafe , or the seeing , or the blind ? haue not I the Lord ?
Now therefore goe , and I will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
And he said , O my Lord , send , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses , and hee said , Is not Aaron the Leuite thy brother ? I know that he can speake well . And also behold , he commeth foorth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , hee will be glad in his heart . And thou shalt speake vnto him , and put words in his mouth , and I wil be with thy mouth , & with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall doe .
And he shal be thy spokesman vnto the people : and he shall be , euen hee shall be to thee in stead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him in stead of God .

¶ And Moses went and returned to Iethro his father in law , and said vnto him , Let me goe , I pray thee , and returne vnto my brethren , which are in Egypt , and see whether they bee yet aliue . And Iethro said to Moses , Goe in peace .
And the Lord said vnto Moses in Midian , Goe , returne into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
And Moses tooke his wife , and his sonnes , and set them vpon an asse , and he returned to the land of Egypt . And Moses tooke the rod of God in his hand .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , When thou goest to returne into Egypt , see that thou doe all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I haue put in thine hand : but I wil harden his heart , that hee shall not let the people goe .
And thou shalt say vnto Pharaoh , Thus saith the Lord , Israel is my sonne , euen my first borne .

And they said , The God of the Hebrewes hath met with vs : let vs goe , we pray thee , three dayes iourney into the desert , and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God , lest hee fall vpon vs with pestilence , or with the sword .
And the King of Egypt said vnto them , Wherfore doe ye , Moses and Aaron , let the people from their workes ? get you vnto your burdens .
And Pharaoh said , Behold , the people of the land now are many , & you make them rest from their burdens .
And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taske - masters of the people , and their officers , saying ;
Yee shall no more giue the people straw to make bricke , as heretofore : let them goe and gather straw for themselues .
And the tale of the brickes which they did make heretofore , you shall lay vpon them : you shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us goe and sacrifice to our God .
Let there more worke be layde vpon the men , that they may labour therein , and let them not regard vaine wordes .
¶ And the taske - masters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spake to the people , saying , Thus saith Pharaoh , I will not giue you straw .
Goe ye , get you straw where you can find it : yet not ought of your worke shall be diminished .
So the people were scattered abroad throughout al the land of Egypt , to gather stubble in stead of straw .
And the taske - masters hasted them , saying ; Fulfill your workes , your dayly taskes , as when there was straw .
And the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaohs task - masters had set ouer them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore haue ye not fulfilled your taske , in making bricke , both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cryed vnto Pharaoh , saying , Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy seruants ?
There is no straw giuen vnto thy seruants , and they say to vs , Make bricke : and beholde , thy seruants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine owne people .
But he said , Ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , Let vs goe and doe sacrifice to the Lord .
Goe therefore now and worke : for there shall no straw bee giuen you , yet shall ye deliuer the tale of brickes .
And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in euill case , after it was said , Yee shall not minish ought from your brickes of your dayly taske .
¶ And they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came foorth from Pharaoh .
And they said vnto them ; The Lord looke vpon you , and iudge , because you haue made our sauour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his seruants , to put a sword in their hand to slay vs .

And I appeared vnto Abraham , vnto Isaac , and vnto Iacob , by the Name of God Almighty , but by my name IEHOVAH was I not knowen to them .
And I haue also established my Couenant with them , to giue them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
And I haue also heard the groning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keepe in bondage : and I haue remembred my Couenant .
Wherefore say vnto the children of Israel , I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from vnder the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will rid you out of their bondage : and I will redeeme you with a stretched out arme , and with great iudgements .
And I will take you to mee for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from vnder the burdens of the Egyptians .
And I will bring you in vnto the lande concerning the which I did sweare to giue it , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Iacob , and I will giue it you for an heritage , I am the Lord .
¶ And Moses spake so vnto the children of Israel : but they hearkened not vnto Moses , for anguish of spirit , and for cruell bondage .
And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Goe in , speake vnto Pharaoh King of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel goe out of his land .
And Moses spake before the Lord , saying , Behold , the children of Israel haue not hearkened vnto me : how then shal Pharaoh heare me , who am of vncircumcised lips ?
And the Lord spake vnto Moses and vnto Aaron , & gaue them a charge vnto the children of Israel , and vnto Pharaoh King of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .

But Pharaoh shall not hearken vnto you , that I may lay my hand vpon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt , by great iudgments .
And the Egyptians shall knowe that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand vpon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .

And Moses was fourescore yeres olde , and Aaron fourescore and three yeeres old , when they spake vnto Pharaoh .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , and vnto Aaron , saying :
When Pharaoh shall speake vnto you , saying , Shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say vnto Aaron , Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
¶ And Moses and Aaron went in vnto Pharaoh , and they did so as the Lord had commanded : and Aaron cast downe his rod before Pharaoh , and before his seruants , and it became a serpent .
Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers ; now the Magicians of Egypt , they also did in like maner with their enchantments .
For they cast downe euery man his rod , and they became serpents : but Aarons rod swallowed vp their rods .
And hee hardened Pharaohs heart , that hee hearkened not vnto them , as the Lord had said .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Pharaohs heart is hardened : he refuseth to let the people goe .
Get thee vnto Pharaoh in the morning , loe , he goeth out vnto the water , and thou shalt stand by the riuers brinke , against hee come : and the rod which was turned to a serpent , shalt thou take in thine hand .
And thou shalt say vnto him , The Lord God of the Hebrewes hath sent me vnto thee , saying ; Let my people goe , that they may serue mee in the wildernesse : and beholde , hitherto thou wouldest not heare .
Thus saith the Lord , In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : behold , I will smite with the rod that is in my hand , vpon the waters which are in the riuer , and they shalbe turned to blood .
And the fish that is in the riuer shall die , and the riuer shall stincke , and the Egyptians shall loathe to drinke of the water of the riuer .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , Say vnto Aaron , Take thy rod , & stretch out thine hand vpon the waters of Egypt , vpon their streames , vpon their riuers , and vpon their ponds , and vpon all their pooles of water , that they may become blood , and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt , both in vessels of wood , and in vessels of stone .
And Moses and Aaron did so , as the Lord commanded : and he lift vp the rod and smote the waters that were in the riuer , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his seruants : and all the waters that were in the riuer , were turned to blood .
And the fish that was in the riuer died : and the riuer stunke , and the Egyptians could not drinke of the water of the riuer : and there was blood throughout all the land Egypt .
And the Magicians of Egypt did so , with their enchantments : and Pharaohs heart was hardened , neither did he hearken vnto them , as the Lord had said .

And all the Egyptians digged round about the riuer for water to drinke : for they could not drinke of the water of the riuer .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , Goe vnto Pharaoh , and say vnto him ; Thus sayeth the Lord , Let my people goe , that they may serue me .

And the frogges shall come vp both on thee , and vpon thy people , and vpon all thy seruants .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses ; Say vnto Aaron , Stretch foorth thine hand with thy rodde ouer the streames , ouer the riuers , and ouer the ponds , and cause frogges to come vp vpon the land of Egypt .
And Aaron stretched out his hand ouer the waters of Egypt , and the frogges came vp , and couered the land of Egypt .
And the Magicians did so with their inchantments , and brought vp frogges vpon the land of Egypt .
¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses , and Aaron , and said , Intreat the Lord , that hee may take away the frogges from me , and from my people : and I will let the people goe , that they may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord .
And Moses saide vnto Pharaoh , Glory ouer mee : when shall I entreat for thee , and for thy seruants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogges from thee , and thy houses , that they may remaine in the riuer onely ?
And he said , To morrow . And hee said , Bee it according to thy word : That thou mayest know that there is none like vnto the Lord our God .
And the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy seruants , and from thy people ; they shall remaine in the riuer onely .
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh , and Moses cried vnto the Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh .
And the Lord did according to the word of Moses : and the frogges died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
And they gathered them together vpon heapes , and the land stanke .
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit , he hardned his heart , and hearkened not vnto them , as the Lord had said .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Say vnto Aaron , Stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become lice , thorowout all the land of Egypt .
And they did so : for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice , in man and in beast : all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
And the Magicians did so with their enchantments to bring foorth lice , but they could not : so there were lice vpon man and vpon beast .
Then the Magicians said vnto Pharaoh ; This is the singer of God . And Pharaohs heart was hardned , and he hearkened not vnto them , as the Lord had said .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Rise vp early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh : loe , he commeth foorth to the water , and say vnto him ; Thus saith the Lord , Let my people goe , that they may serue me .
Els , if thou wilt not let my people goe , beholde , I will send swarmes of flies vpon thee , and vpon thy seruants , and vpon thy people , and into thy houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall bee full of swarmes of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
And I will seuer in that day the lande of Goshen in which my people dwell , that no swarmes of flies shall be there , to the end thou maiest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth .
And I will put a diuision betweene my people and thy people : to morrow shall this signe be .
And the Lord did so : and there came a grieuous swarme of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his seruants houses , and into all the lande of Egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarme of flies .
¶ And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron , and said , Goe yee , sacrifice to your God in the land .
And Moses said , It is not meete so to doe ; for we shal sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians , to the Lord our God : Loe , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes , and will they not stone vs ?
We will goe three dayes iourney into the wildernesse , and sacrifice to the Lord our God , as he shall command vs .
And Pharaoh said , I wil let you goe that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God , in the wildernes : onely you shall not goe very farre away : intreate for me .
And Moses said , Behold , I goe out from thee , and I will intreate the Lord that the swarmes of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his seruants , and from his people to morrow : but let not Pharaoh deale deceitfully any more , in not letting the people goe to sacrifice to the Lord .
And Moses went out from Pharaoh , and intreated the Lord :
And the Lord did according to the word of Moses : and he remooued the swarmes of flies from Pharaoh , from his seruants , and from his people : there remained not one .

Then the Lord said vnto Moses , Goe in vnto Pharaoh , and tell him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrewes , Let my people goe , that they may serue me .
For if thou refuse to let them goe , and wilt hold them still ,
Behold , the hand of the Lord is vpon thy cattell which is in the field , vpon the horses , vpon the asses , vpon the camels , vpon the oxen , and vpon the sheepe : there shall be a very grieuous murraine .
And the Lord shall seuer betweene the cattell of Israel , and the cattell of Egypt , and there shall nothing die of all that is the childrens of Israel .
And the Lord appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the Lord shall doe this thing in the land .
And the Lord did that thing on the morrow ; and all the cattell of Egypt died , but of the cattell of the children of Israel died not one .
And Pharaoh sent , and beholde , there was not one of the cattell of the Israelites dead . And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people goe .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , and vnto Aaron , Take to you handfuls of ashes of the fornace , and let Moses sprinkle it towards the heauen , in the sight of Pharaoh :
And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall bee a boyle breaking forth with blaines , vpon man and vpon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
And they tooke ashes of the fornace , and stood before Pharaoh , and Moses sprinkled it vp toward heauen : and it became a boile breaking forth with blaines , vpon man and vpon beast .
And the Magicians could not stand before Moses , because of the boiles : for the boile was vpon the magicians , and vpon all the Egyptians .
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and hee hearkened not vnto them , as the Lord had spoken vnto Moses .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Rise vp earely in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say vnto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrewes , Let my people goe , that they may serue me .
For I will at this time send all my plagues vpon thine heart , and vpon thy seruants , and vpon thy people : that thou mayest knowe that there is none like me in all the earth .
For now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people , with pestilence , and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
And in very deede , for this cause haue I raised thee vp , for to shewe in thee my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
As yet exaltest thou thy selfe against my people , that thou wilt not let them goe ?
Behold , to morrow about this time , I wil cause it to raine a very grieuous haile , such as hath not bene in Egypt , since the foundation thereof euen vntill now .
Send therefore now , and gather thy cattell , and all that thou hast in the field : for vpon euery man and beast which shal be found in the field , and shal not bee brought home , the haile shall come downe vpon them , and they shall die .
Hee that feared the word of the Lord amongst the seruants of Pharaoh , made his seruants and his cattell flee into the houses .
And he that regarded not the word of the Lord , left his seruants and his cattell in the field .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Stretch forth thine hand toward heauen , that there may be haile in all the land of Egypt , vpon man and vpon beast , and vpon euery herbe of the field , thorowout the land of Egypt .
And Moses stretched foorth his rod toward heauen , and the Lord sent thunder and haile , and the fire ranne along vpon the ground , and the Lord rained haile vpon the land of Egypt .
So there was haile , and fire mingled with the haile , very grieuous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt , since it became a nation .
And the haile smote throughout all the land of Egypt , all that was in the field , both man and beast : and the haile smote euery herbe of the fielde , and brake euery tree of the field .
Onely in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were , was there no haile .
¶ And Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said vnto them , I haue sinned this time : the Lord is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
Entreat the Lord , ( for it is enough ) that there be no more mighty thunderings and haile , and I will let you goe , and ye shall stay no longer .
And Moses saide vnto him , Assoone as I am gone out of the citie , I will spread abroad my hands vnto the Lord , and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more haile : that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lords .
But as for thee and thy seruants , I know that ye will not yet feare the Lord God .
And the flaxe , and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the eare , and the flaxe was bolled :
But the wheat and the rye were not smitten : for they were not growen vp .
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands vnto the Lord : and the thunders and haile ceased , and the raine was not powred vpon the earth .
And when Pharaoh saw that the raine , and the haile and the thunders were ceased , hee sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his seruants .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Goe in vnto Pharaoh : for I haue hardned his heart , and the heart of his seruants , that I might shew these my signes before him :
And that thou mayest tell in the eares of thy sonne , and of thy sonnes sonne , what things I haue wrought in Egypt , and my signes which I haue done amongst them , that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
And Moses and Aaron came in vnto Pharaoh , and saide vnto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrewes , How long wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe before mee ? Let my people goe , that they may serue me .
Els , if thou refuse to let my people goe , behold , to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast .
And they shall couer the face of the earth , that one cannot be able to see the earth , and they shall eate the residue of that which is escaped , which remaineth vnto you from the haile , and shall eate euery tree , which groweth for you out of the field .
And they shall fill thy houses , and the houses of all thy seruants , and the houses of all the Egyptians , which neither thy fathers , nor thy fathers fathers haue seene , since the day that they were vpon the earth , vnto this day . And he turned himselfe , and went out from Pharaoh .
And Pharaohs seruants said vnto him , How long shall this man be a snare vnto vs ? Let the men goe , that they may serue the Lord their God : Knowest thou not yet , that Egypt is destroyed ?
And Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh : and he said vnto them , Goe , serue the Lord your God : but who are they that shall goe ?
Not so : goe now yee that are men , and serue the Lord , for that you did desire : and they were driuen out from Pharaohs presence .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , Stretch out thine hand ouer the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come vp vpon the land of Egypt , and eate euery herbe of the land , euen all that the haile hath left .
And Moses stretched forth his rod ouer the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an East wind vpon the land all that day , and all that night : and when it was morning , the East wind brought the locusts . And the locusts went vp ouer all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grieuous were they : before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
For they couered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkned , and they did eate euery herbe of the land , and all the fruit of the trees , which the haile had left , and there remained not any greene thing in the trees , or in the herbes of the field , through all the land of Egypt .
¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste : and he said , I haue sinned against the Lord your God , and against you .
Now therefore forgiue , I pray thee , my sinne onely this once , and intreat the Lord your God , that hee may take away from mee this death onely .
And he went out from Pharaoh , and intreated the Lord .
And the Lord turned a mighty strong West wind , which tooke away the locusts , and cast them into the red sea : there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart , so that hee would not let the children of Israel goe .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , Stretch out thine hand toward heauen , that there may be darkenesse ouer the land of Egypt , euen darkenes which may be felt .
And Moses stretched foorth his hand toward heauen : and there was a thicke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three dayes .
They saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three dayes : but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
¶ And Pharaoh called vnto Moses , and said , Goe ye , serue the Lord : onely let your flockes and your herds be stayed : let your litle ones also goe with you . And Moses saide , Thou must giue vs also sacrifices , and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice vnto the Lord our God .
Our cattell also shall goe with vs : there shall not an hoofe bee left behind : for thereof must we take to serue the Lord our God : and we knowe not with what wee must serue the Lord , vntill we come thither .
¶ But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart , and he would not let them goe .
And Pharaoh said vnto him , Get thee from me , take heed to thy selfe : see my face no more : for in that day thou seest my face , thou shalt die .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Yet will I bring one plague more vpon Pharaoh , and vpon Egypt , afterwards hee will let you goe heuce : when hee shall let you goe , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
Speake now in the eares of the people , and let euery man borrowe of his neighbour , and euery woman of her neighbour , iewels of siluer , and iewels of gold .
And the Lord gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians . Moreouer the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaohs seruants , and in the sight of the people .
And Moses said , Thus saith the Lord , about midnight will I goe out into the midst of Egypt .
And all the first borne in the lande of Egypt shall die , from the first borne of Pharaoh , that sitteth vpon his throne , euen vnto the first borne of the maid seruant that is behind the mill , and all the first borne of beasts .
And there shall bee a great crie throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall bee like it any more .
But against any of the children of Israel , shal not a dog moue his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference betweene the Egyptians and Israel .
And all these thy seruants shall come downe vnto me , and bow downe themselues vnto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee ; and after that I wil goe out : and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken vnto you , that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying ,
This moneth shalbe vnto you the beginning of moneths : it shall be the first moneth of the yeere to you .
¶ Speake ye vnto all the Congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this moneth they shall take to them euery man a lambe , according to the house of their fathers , a lambe for an house .
And if the houshold be too little for the lambe , let him and his neighbour next vnto his house , take it according to the number of the soules : euery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lambe .
Your lambe shall be without blemish , a male of the first yeere : yee shall take it out from the sheepe or from the goates .
And ye shall keepe it vp vntill the fourteenth day of the same moneth : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the euening .
And they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side postes , and on the vpper doore poste , of the houses wherin they shall eate it .
And they shall eat the flesh in that night roste with fire , and vnleauened bread , and with bitter herbes they shall eate it .
Eate not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roste with fire : his head , with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
And ye shall let nothing of it remaine vntill the morning : and that which remaineth of it vntill the morning , ye shall burne with fire .
¶ And thus shall ye eate it : with your loines girded , your shooes on your feet , and your staffe in your hand : and ye shall eate it in haste : it is the Lords Passeouer .
For I will passe through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the first borne in the land of Egypt , both man & beast , and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute iudgement : I am the Lord .
And the blood shall be to you for a token vpon the houses where you are : and when I see the blood , I will passe ouer you , and the plague shall not bee vpon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt .
And this day shall be vnto you for a memoriall : and you shall keepe in a feast to the Lord , throughout your generations : you shall keepe it a feast by an ordinance for euer .
Seuen dayes shall ye eate vnleauened bread , euen the first day yee shall put away leauen out of your houses : For whosoeuer eateth leauened bread , from the first day vntil the seuenth day , that soule shall be cut off from Israel .
And in the first day there shalbe an holy conuocation , and in the seuenth day there shall be an holy conuocation to you : no maner of worke shalbe done in them , saue that which euery man must eate , that onely may bee done of you .
And yee shall obserue the feast of vnleauened bread : for in this selfe same day haue I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt ; therefore shall ye obserue this day in your generations , by an ordinance for euer .
¶ In the first moneth , on the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen , ye shall eate vnleauened bread vntill the one and twentieth day of the moneth at euen .
Seuen dayes shall there bee no leauen found in your houses : for whosoeuer eateth that which is leauened , euen that soule shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or borne in the land .
Yee shall eate nothing leauened : in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread .
¶ Then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel , and said vnto them ; Draw out and take you a lambe , according to your families , and kill the Passeouer .
And ye shall take a bunch of hysope , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side postes with the blood that is in the bason : and none of you shall goe out at the doore of his house , vntill the morning .
For the Lord wil passe through to smite the Egyptians : and when hee seeth the blood vpon the lintel , and on the two side - postes , the Lord will passe ouer the doore , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in vnto your houses to smite you .
And ye shall obserue this thing for an ordinance to thee , and to thy sonnes for euer .
And it shall come to passe when yee bee come to the land , which the Lord will giue you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keepe this seruice .
And it shall come to passe , when your children shall say vnto you , What meane you by this seruice ?
That ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lords Passeouer , who passed ouer the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smote the Egyptians , and deliuered our houses . And the people bowed the head , and worshipped .
And the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
¶ And it came to passe that at midnight the Lord smote all the first borne in the land of Egypt , from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne , vnto the first borne of the captiue that was in the dungeon , and all the first borne of cattell .
And Pharaoh rose vp in the night , hee and all his seruants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt : for there was not a house , where there was not one dead .
¶ And hee called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise vp , and get you forth from amongst my people , both you and the children of Israel : and goe , serue the Lord , as ye haue said .
Also take your flockes and your heards , as ye haue said : and bee gone , and blesse me also .
And the Egyptians were vrgent vpon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste : for they said , We be all dead men .
And the people tooke their dough before it was leauened , their kneading troughes beeing bound vp in their clothes vpon their shoulders .
And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses : and they borrowed of the Egyptians iewels of siluer , and iewels of gold , and raiment .
And the Lord gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent vnto them such things as they required : and they spoiled the Egyptians .
¶ And the children of Israel iourneyed from Rameses to Succoth , about sixe hundred thousand on foote that were men , beside children .
And a mixed multitude went vp also with them , and flocks and heards , euen very much cattell .
And they baked vnleauened cakes of the dough , which they brought forth out of Egypt ; for it was not leauened : because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselues any victuall .
¶ Now the soiourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was foure hundred and thirtie yeeres .
And it came to passe at the end of the foure hundred and thirtie yeeres , euen the selfe same day it came to passe , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
It is a night to be much obserued vnto the Lord , for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : This is that night of the Lord to be obserued of all the children of Israel , in their generations .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses and Aaron , This is the ordinance of the Passeouer : there shall no stranger eate thereof .
But euery mans seruant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eate thereof .
A forreiner , and an hired seruant shall not eate thereof .
In one house shall it be eaten , thou shalt not carie foorth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house , neither shall ye breake a bone thereof .
All the Congregation of Israel shall keepe it .
And when a stranger shall soiourne with thee , and will keepe the Passeouer to the Lord , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come neere , and keepe it : and he shall be as one that is borne in the land : for no vncircumcised person shall eate thereof .
One law shall be to him that is home - borne , and vnto the stranger that soiourneth among you .
Thus did all the children of Israel : as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne , whatsoeuer openeth the wombe , among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
¶ And Moses said vnto the people , Remember this day , in which yee came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage : for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place : there shall no leauened bread be eaten .
This day came yee out , in the moneth Abib .
¶ And it shalbe when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hiuites , and the Iebusites , which he sware vnto thy fathers to giue thee , a land flowing with milke and hony , that thou shalt keepe this seruice in this moneth .
Seuen dayes thou shalt eate vnleauened bread , and in the seuenth day shall be a feast to the Lord .
Unleauened bread shall be eaten seuen dayes : and there shall no leauened bread bee seene with thee : neither shall there be leauen seene with thee in all thy quarters .
¶ And thou shalt shew thy sonne in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the Lord did vnto mee , when I came forth out of Egypt .
And it shall bee for a signe vnto thee , vpon thine hand , and for a memoriall betweene thine eyes , that the Lords law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hande hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt .
Thou shalt therfore keepe this ordinance in his season from yeere to yere .
¶ And it shalbe when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites as he sware vnto thee , and to thy fathers , and shall giue it thee :
That thou shalt set apart vnto the Lord all that openeth the matrix , and euery firstling that commeth of a beast , which thou hast , the males shall be the Lords .
And euery firstling of an asse thou shalt redeeme with a lambe : and if thou wilt not redeeme it , then thou shalt breake his necke , and all the first borne of man amongst thy children shalt thou redeeme .
¶ And it shalbe when thy sonne asketh thee in time to come , saying , What is this ? That thou shalt say vnto him ; By strength of hand the Lord brought vs out from Egypt , from the house of bondage .
And it came to passe when Pharaoh would hardly let vs goe , that the Lord slew all the first borne in the land of Egypt , both the first borne of man , and the first borne of beast : Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the matrix , being males : but all the first borne of my children I redeeme .
And it shall be for a token vpon thine hand , and for frontlets betweene thine eyes . For by strength of hand the Lord brought vs foorth out of Egypt .
¶ And it came to passe when Pharaoh had let the people goe , that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was neere : For God saide , Lest peraduenture the people repent when they see warre , and they returne to Egypt :
But God ledde the people about through the way of the wildernesse of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went vp harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
And Moses tooke the bones of Ioseph with him : for hee had straitly sworne the children of Israel , saying ; God will surely visite you , and ye shall cary vp my bones away hence with you .
¶ And they tooke their iourney from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wildernesse .
And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to giue them light to goe by day and night .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , that they turne and encampe before Pi - hahiroth , betweene Migdol and the sea , ouer against Baal - Zephon : before it shall ye encampe by the sea .
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are intangled in the land , the wildernesse hath shut them in .
And I will harden Pharaohs heart , that he shall follow after them , and I will be honoured vpon Pharaoh , and vpon all his hoste , That the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord . And they did so .
¶ And it was told the King of Egypt , that the people fled : And the heart of Pharaoh and of his seruants was turned against the people , and they said , Why haue wee done this , that we haue let Israel goe from seruing vs ?
And hee made ready his charet , and tooke his people with him .
And hee tooke sixe hundred chosen charets , and all the charets of Egypt , and captaines ouer euery one of them .
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh King of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand . But the Egyptians pursued after them ( all the horses and charets of Pharaoh , and his horsemen , and his army ) and ouertooke them encamping by the sea , beside Pi - hahiroth before Baal - Zephon .
¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh , the children of Israel lift vp their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians marched after them , and they were sore afraid : and the children of Israel lift vp their eyes , and beholde , the Egyptians marched after them , and they were sore afraid : and the children of Israel cried out vnto the Lord .
And they said vnto Moses , Because there were no graues in Egypt , hast thou taken vs away to die in the wildernesse ? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with vs , to cary vs foorth out of Egypt ?
Is not this the word that wee did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let vs alone , that we may serue the Egyptians ? For it had bene better for vs to serue the Egyptians , then that wee should die in the wildernesse .
¶ And Moses saide vnto the people , Feare ye not , stand still , and see the saluation of the Lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye haue seene to day , ye shall see them againe no more for euer .
The Lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Wherefore criest thou vnto me ? Speake vnto the children of Israel , that they goe forward .
But lift thou vp thy rodde , and stretch out thine hand ouer the Sea , and diuide it : and the children of Israel shall goe on dry ground thorow the mids of the Sea .
And I , beholde , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get mee honour vpon Pharaoh , and vpon all his hoste , vpon his charets , and vpon his horsemen .
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I haue gotten me honour vpon Pharaoh , vpon his charets , and vpon his horsemen .
¶ And the Angel of God which went before the campe of Israel , remoued and went behind them , and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behinde them .
And it came betweene the campe of the Egyptians , and the campe of Israel , and it was a cloud and darkenesse to them , but it gaue light by night to these : so that the one came not neere the other all the night .
And Moses stretched out his hand ouer the Sea , and the Lord caused the Sea to goe backe by a strong East winde all that night , and made the Sea dry land , and the waters were diuided .
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the Sea vpon the dry ground , and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hand , and on their left .
¶ And the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them , to the midst of the Sea , euen all Pharaohs horses , his charets and his horsemen .
And it came to passe , that in the morning watch the Lord looked vnto the hoste of the Egyptians , through the pillar of fire , and of the cloude , and troubled the hoste of the Egyptians ,
And tooke off their charet wheeles , that they draue them heauily : So that the Egyptians said , Let vs flee from the face of Israel : for the Lord fighteth for them , against the Egyptians .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Stretch out thine hand ouer the Sea , that the waters may come againe vpon the Egyptians , vpon their charets , and vpon their horsemen .
And Moses stretched foorth his hand ouer the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared : and the Egyptians fled against it : and the Lord ouerthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
And the waters returned , and couered the charets , and the horsemen , and all the hoste of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them : there remained not so much as one of them .
But the children of Israel walked vpon drie land , in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hand , and on their left . Thus the Lord saued Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians : and Israel sawe the Egyptians dead vpon the sea shore .

Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song vnto the Lord , and spake , saying , I will sing vnto the Lord : for he hath triumphed gloriously , the horse and his rider hath he throwen into the Sea .
The Lord is my strength and song , and he is become my saluation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation , my fathers God , and I wil exalt him .
The depths haue couered them : they sanke into the bottome as a stone .
Thy right hand , O Lord , is become glorious in power , thy right hand , O Lord , hath dashed in pieces the enemie .
And in the greatnesse of thine excellencie thou hast ouerthrowen them , that rose vp against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together : the floods stood vpright as an heape , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the Sea .
The enemie said , I will pursue , I wil ouertake , I wil diuide the spoile : my lust shall be satisfied vpon them : I will draw my sword , mine hand shall destroy them .
Thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea couered them , they sanke as lead in the mighty waters .
Who is like vnto thee , O Lord , amongst the gods ? who is like thee , glorious in holinesse , fearefull in praises , doing wonders !
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
Thou in thy mercie hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength vnto thy holy habitation .
The people shall heare , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina .
Then the dukes of Edom shal be amased : the mighty men of Moab trembling shall take hold vpon them : all the inhabitants of Canaan shal melt away .
Feare and dread shall fall vpon them , by the greatnesse of thine arme they shall be as still as a stone , till thy people passe ouer , O Lord , till the people passe ouer which thou hast purchased .
Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountaine of thine inheritance , in the place , O Lord , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands haue established .
The Lord shal reigne for euer and euer .
For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his charets and with his horsemen into the sea , and the Lord brought againe the waters of the Sea vpon them : But the children of Israel went on drie land in the mids of the sea .
¶ And Miriam the prophetesse the sister of Aaron , tooke a timbrell in her hand , and all the women went out after her , with timbrels & with dances .
And Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he throwen into the sea .
So Moses brought Israel from the red sea , and they went out into the wildernesse of Shur : and they went three dayes in the wildernesse , and found no water .
¶ And when they came to Marah , they could not drinke of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter : therefore the name of it was called Marah .
And the people murmured against Moses , saying , What shall wee drinke ?
And he cried vnto the Lord : and the Lord shewed him a tree , which when hee had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweete : there he made a statute & an ordinance , and there he proued them ,
And said , If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God , and wilt doe that which is right in his sight , and wilt giue eare to his Commandements , and keepe all his Statutes , I will put none of these diseases vpon thee , which I haue brought vpon the Egyptians : for I am the Lord that healeth thee .

And they tooke their iourney from Elim , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came vnto the wildernesse of Sin , which is betweene Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second moneth after their departing out of the land of Egypt . And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wildernesse .
And it shall come to passe , that on the sixt day , they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather dayly .
And Moses said , This shalbe when the Lord shal giue you in the euening flesh to eate , and in the morning bread to the full : for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmure against him ; and what are wee ? your murmurings are not against vs , but against the Lord .
¶ And Moses spake vnto Aaron , Say vnto all the Congregation of the children of Israel , Come neere before the Lord : for hee hath heard your murmurings .
And it came to passe as Aaron spake vnto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wildernesse , and behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloude .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel : Speake vnto them , saying , At euen ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shalbe filled with bread : and ye shal know that I am the Lord your God .
And it came to passe , that at euen the Quailes came vp , and couered the campe : and in the morning the dew lay round about the hoste .
And when the dewe that lay was gone vp , behold , vpon the face of the wildernesse there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoare frost on the ground .
And when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is Manna : for they wist not what it was . And Moses said vnto them , This is the bread which the Lord hath giuen you to eate .
¶ This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded : gather of it euery man according to his eating : an Omer for euery man , according to the number of your persons , take yee euery man for them which are in his tents .
And the children of Israel did so , and gathered some more , some lesse .
And when they did mete it with an Omer , he that gathered much , had nothing ouer , and he that gathered litle , had no lacke : they gathered euery man according to his eating .
And Moses saide , Let no man leaue of it till the morning .
Notwithstanding they hearkened not vnto Moses , but some of them left of it vntill the morning , and it bred wormes , and stanke : and Moses was wroth with them .
And they gathered it euery morning , euery man according to his eating : and when the Sunne waxed hot , it melted .
¶ And it came to passe that on the sixt day they gathered twice as much bread , two Omers for one man : and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
And he said vnto them , This is that which the Lord hath said , To morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath vnto the Lord : bake that which you will bake , to day , and seethe that ye will seethe , and that which remaineth ouer , lay vp for you to be kept vntill the morning .
And they laid it vp till the morning , as Moses bade : and it did not stinke , neither was there any worme therein .
And Moses saide , Eate that to day , for to day is a Sabbath vnto the Lord : to day yee shall not finde it in the field .
Sixe dayes ye shall gather it , but on the seuenth day which is the Sabbath , in it there shall be none .
¶ And it came to passe , that there went out some of the people on the seuenth day for to gather , and they found none .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , How long refuse yee to keepe my Commandements , and my Lawes ?
See , for that the Lord hath giuen you the Sabbath , therefore hee giueth you on the sixt day the bread of two dayes : abide yee euery man in his place : let no man goe out of his place on the seuenth day .
So the people rested on the seuenth day .
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like Coriander seed , white : and the taste of it was like wafers made with hony .
¶ And Moses said , This is the thing which the Lord commandeth : Fill an Omer of it to bee kept for your generations , that they may see the bread wherewith I haue fed you in the wildernesse , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
And Moses sayd vnto Aaron , Take a pot , and put an Omer full of Manna therein , and lay it vp before the Lord , to be kept for your generations .
As the Lord commaunded Moses , so Aaron layd it vp before the Testimonie , to be kept .
And the children of Israel did eat Manna fortie yeeres , vntill they came to a land inhabited : they did eate Manna , vntill they came vnto the borders of the land of Canaan .

And all the Congregation of the children of Israel iourneyed from the wildernesse of Sin after their iourneys , according to the commandement of the Lord , and pitched in Rephidim : and there was no water for the people to drinke .
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said , Giue vs water that wee may drinke . And Moses said vnto them , Why chide you with mee ? Wherefore doe ye tempt the Lord ?
And the people thirsted there for water , and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought vs vp out of Egypt , to kill vs and our children , and our cattell with thirst ?
And Moses cried vnto the Lord , saying , What shall I doe vnto this people ? They be almost ready to stone me .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Goe on before the people , and take with thee of the Elders of Israel : and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the riuer , take in thine hand , and goe .
Behold , I will stand before thee there , vpon the rocke in Horeb , and thou shalt smite the rocke , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drinke . And Moses did so , in the sight of the Elders of Israel .
And hee called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the chiding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the Lord , saying , Is the Lord amongst vs , or not ?
¶ Then came Amalek , & fought with Israel in Rephidim .
And Moses said vnto Ioshua , Choose vs out men , and goe out , fight with Amalek : to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill , with the rodde of God in mine hand .
So Ioshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek : and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went vp to the top of the hill .
And it came to passe when Moses held vp his hand , that Israel preuailed : and when he let downe his hand , Amalek preuailed .
But Moses hands were heauie , and they tooke a stone , and put it vnder him , and he sate thereon : and Aaron and Hur stayed vp his hands , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side , and his handes were steady vntill the going downe of the Sunne .
And Ioshua discomfited Amalek , and his people , with the edge of the sword .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Write this for a memoriall in a booke , and rehearse it in the eares of Ioshua : for I will vtterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from vnder heauen .
And Moses built an Altar , and called the name of it IEHOUAH Nissi .
<NON-VERSE> When Iethro the Priest of Midian , Moses father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt :
Then Iethro Moses father in law tooke Zipporah Moses wife , after he had sent her backe , And her two sonnes , of which the name of the one was Gershom : for he said , I haue bene an alien in a strange land .
And the name of the other was Eliezer : for the God of my father , said he , was mine helpe , and deliuered me from the sword of Pharaoh . And Iethro Moses father in law came with his sonnes and his wife vnto Moses into the wildernes , where he encamped at the mount of God .
And he said vnto Moses , I thy father in law Iethro am come vnto thee , and thy wife , and her two sonnes with her .
¶ And Moses went out to meete his father in law , and did obeysance , and kissed him : and they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
And Moses told his father in law , all that the Lord had done vnto Pharaoh , and to the Egyptians for Israels sake , and all the trauaile that had come vpon them by the way , and how the Lord deliuered them .
And Iethro reioyced for all the goodnesse which the Lord had done to Israel : whom he had deliuered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
And Iethro said , Blessed be the Lord , who hath deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath deliuered the people from vnder the hand of the Egyptians .
Now I know that the Lord is greater then all gods : for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly , hee was aboue them .
And Iethro , Moses father in law , tooke a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the Elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses father in law before God .
¶ And it came to passe on the morrow , that Moses sate to iudge the people : and the people stood by Moses , from the morning vnto the euening .
And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ? Why sittest thou thy selfe alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning vnto euen ?
And Moses said vnto his father in law , Because the people come vnto me to enquire of God .
When they haue a matter , they come vnto mee , and I iudge betweene one and another , and I doe make them know the statutes of God and his Lawes .
And Moses father in law saide vnto him , The thing that thou doest , is not good .
Thou wilt surely weare away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heauy for thee ; thou art not able to performe it thy selfe alone .
Hearken now vnto my voyce , I will giue thee counsell , and God shall be with thee : Be thou for the people to Godward , that thou mayest bring the causes vnto God :
And thou shalt teach them ordinances and lawes , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walke , and the worke that they must doe .
Moreouer thou shalt prouide out of all the people able men , such as feare God , men of trueth , hating couetousnesse , and place such ouer them , to bee rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tennes .
And let them iudge the people at all seasons : and it shall bee that euery great matter they shall bring vnto thee , but euery small matter they shal iudge : so shall it be easier for thy selfe , and they shall beare the burden with thee .
If thou shalt doe this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt bee able to endure , and all this people shall also goe to their place in peace .
So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads ouer the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tennes .
And they iudged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought vnto Moses , but euery small matter they iudged themselues .

In the third moneth when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wildernesse of Sinai .
For they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wildernesse , and there Israel camped before the mount .
And Moses went vp vnto God : and the Lord called vnto him out of the mountaine , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Iacob , and tell the children of Israel :
Ye haue seene what I did vnto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on Eagles wings , and brought you vnto my selfe .
Now therfore if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keepe my couenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure vnto me aboue all people : for all the earth is mine .
And ye shall be vnto me a kingdome of Priestes , and an holy nation . These are the wordes which thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel .
¶ And Moses came and called for the Elders of the people , and layd before their faces all these wordes which the Lord commanded him .
And all the people answered together , and said , All that the Lord hath spoken , we will doe . And Moses returned the wordes of the people vnto the Lord .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Loe , I come vnto thee in a thicke cloud , that the people may heare when I speake with thee , and beleeue thee for euer : And Moses told the wordes of the people vnto the Lord .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Moses , Goe vnto the people , and sanctifie them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes .
And be ready against the thirde day : for the third day the Lord will come downe in the sight of all the people , vpon mount Sinai .
And thou shalt set bounds vnto the people round about , saying , Take heed to your selues , that ye goe not vp into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoeuer toucheth the mount , shall be surely put to death .
There shall not a hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned or shot thorow , whether it be beast , or man , it shall not liue : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come vp to the mount .
¶ And Moses went downe from the mount vnto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
And hee said vnto the people , Be ready against the third day : come not at your wiues .
¶ And it came to passe on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thicke cloud vpon the mount , and the voyce of the trumpet exceeding lowd , so that all the people that was in the campe , trembled .
And Moses brought foorth the people out of the campe to meete with God , and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke , because the Lord descended vpon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly .
And when the voyce of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed lowder and lowder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voyce .
And the Lord came downe vpon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Moses vp to the top of the mount , and Moses went vp .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Goe downe , charge the people , lest they breake thorow vnto the Lord to gaze , and many of them perish .
And let the Priestes also which come neere to the Lord , sanctifie themselues , lest the Lord breake foorth vpon them .
And Moses said vnto the Lord , The people cannot come vp to mount Sinai : for thou chargedst vs , saying , Set bounds about the mount , and sanctifie it .
And the Lord said vnto him , Away , get thee downe , and thou shalt come vp , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the Priestes and the people breake through , to come vp vnto the Lord , lest hee breake foorth vpon them .

And God spake all these words , saying ,
I am the Lord thy God , which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage :
Thou shalt haue no other Gods before me .
Thou shalt not make vnto thee any grauen Image , or any likenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water vnder the earth .
Thou shalt not bow downe thy selfe to them , nor serue them : For I the Lord thy God am a iealous God , visiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children , vnto the thirde and fourth generation of them that hate me :
And shewing mercy vnto thousands of them that loue mee , and keepe my Commandements .
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vaine : for the Lord will not holde him guiltlesse , that taketh his Name in vaine .
Remember the Sabbath day , to keepe it holy .
Sixe dayes shalt thou labour , and doe all thy worke :
But the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou shalt not doe any worke , thou , nor thy sonne , nor thy daughter , thy man seruant , nor thy mayd seruant , nor thy cattell , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates :
For in sixe dayes the Lord made heauen and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seuenth day : wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day , and halowed it .
¶ Honour thy father and thy mother : that thy dayes may bee long vpon the land , which the Lord thy God giueth thee . Thou shalt not kill .
Thou shalt not commit adultery . Thou shalt not steale .
Thou shalt not beare false witnes against thy neighbour .
Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house , thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife , nor his man seruant , nor his maid seruant , nor his oxe , nor his asse , nor any thing that is thy neighbours .
¶ And all the people saw the thundrings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountaine smoking : and when the people saw it , they remooued , and stood a farre off .
And they saide vnto Moses , Speake thou with vs , and wee will heare : But let not God speake with vs , lest we die .
And Moses said vnto the people , Feare not : for God is come to prooue you , and that his feare may bee before your faces , that ye sinne not .
And the people stood afarre off , and Moses drew neere vnto the thicke darkenes , where God was .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , Thus thou shalt say vnto the children of Israel , Yee haue seene that I haue talked with you from heauen .
Ye shall not make with me gods of siluer , neither shall ye make vnto you gods of gold .
¶ An Altar of earth thou shalt make vnto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings , and thy peace offerings , thy sheepe , and thine oxen : In all places where I record my Name , I will come vnto thee , and I will blesse thee .
And if thou wilt make mee an Altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewen stone : for if thou lift vp thy toole vpon it , thou hast polluted it .

If thou buy an Hebrew seruant , sixe yeeres he shall serue , and in the seuenth he shall goe out free for nothing .
If he came in by himselfe , he shal goe out by himselfe : if he were married , then his wife shall goe out with him .
If his master haue giuen him a wife , and she haue borne him sonnes or daughters ; the wife and her children shall be her masters , and he shall go out by himselfe .

¶ And if a man sell his daughter to be a mayd seruant , shee shall not goe out as the men seruants doe .

And if he haue betrothed her vnto his sonne , he shall deale with her after the maner of daughters .
If he take him another wife , her food , her rayment , and her duety of mariage shall he not diminish .
And if he doe not these three vnto her , then shall she goe out free without money .

¶ If men striue , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no mischiefe follow , he shalbe surely punished , according as the womans husband will lay vpon him , and hee shall pay as the Iudges determine .
And if any mischiefe follow , then thou shalt giue life for life ,
Eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foote for foote ,
Burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
¶ And if a man smite the eye of his seruant , or the eye of his mayd , that it perish , hee shall let him goe free for his eyes sake .

Whether hee haue gored a sonne , or haue gored a daughter , according to this iudgement shall it bee done vnto him .

The owner of the pit shall make it good , and giue money vnto the owner of them , and the dead beast shalbe his .

¶ If a thiefe bee found breaking vp , and be smitten that he die , there shal no blood be shed for him .
If the Sunne be risen vpon him , there shall be blood shed for him : for hee should make full restitution : if he haue nothing , then he shall bee sold for his theft .
If the theft be certainely found in his hand aliue , whether it bee oxe or asse , or sheepe , he shall restore double .

For all maner of trespasse , whether it be for oxe , for asse , for sheepe , for raiment , or for any maner of lost thing , which another challengeth to be his : the cause of both parties shall come before the Iudges , and whome the Iudges shall condemne , he shall pay double vnto his neighbour .
If a man deliuer vnto his neighbour an asse , or an oxe , or a sheepe , or any beast to keepe , and it die , or be hurt , or driuen away , no man seeing it ,
Then shall an othe of the Lord be betweene them both , that hee hath not put his hand vnto his neighbours goods : and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
And if it be stollen from him , he shall make restitution vnto the owner thereof .

If thou afflict them in any wise , and they crie at all vnto mee , I will surely heare their crie .
And my wrath shall waxe hote , and I will kill you with the sword : and your wiues shall be widowes , and your children fatherlesse .
¶ If thou lend money to any of my people that is poore by thee , thou shalt not be to him as an vsurer , neither shalt thou lay vpon him vsurie .
If thou at all take thy neighbors raiment to pledge , thou shalt deliuer it vnto him by that the sun goeth downe .
For that is his couering onely , it is his raiment for his skinne : wherein shal he sleepe ? and it shal come to passe , when he crieth vnto mee , that I will heare : for I am gracious .
¶ Thou shalt not reuile the Gods , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
¶ Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the first borne of thy sonnes shalt thou giue vnto me .
Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with thy sheepe : seuen dayes it shall be with his damme , on the eight day thou shalt giue it me .
<NON-VERSE>
Thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to bee an vnrighteous witnesse .

¶ Neither shalt thou countenance a poore man in his cause .
¶ If thou meete thine enemies oxe or his asse going astray , thou shalt surely bring it backe to him againe .
If thou see the asse of him that hateth thee , lying vnder his burden , and wouldest forbeare to helpe him , thou shalt surely helpe with him .
Thou shalt not wrest the iudgement of thy poore in his cause .
Keepe thee farre from a false matter : and the innocent and righteous slay thou not : for I will not iustifie the wicked .

¶ Also thou shalt not oppresse a stranger : for yee know the heart of a stranger , seeing yee were strangers in the land of Egypt .
And sixe yeres thou shalt sow thy land , and shalt gather in the fruites thereof :
But the seuenth yeere thou shalt let it rest , and lie still , that the poore of thy people may eate , and what they leaue , the beasts of the field shall eate . In like maner thou shalt deale with thy vineyard , and with thy oliue yard .
Sixe dayes thou shalt doe thy worke , and on the seuenth day thou shalt rest : that thine oxe and thine asse may rest , and the sonne of thy handmayd , & the stranger may be refreshed .
And in all things that I haue said vnto you , be circumspect : and make no mention of the names of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
¶ Three times thou shalt keepe a feast vnto me in the yeere .
Thou shalt keepe the feast of vnleauened bread : thou shalt eate vnleauened bread seuen daies , as I commanded thee in the time appointed of the moneth Abib : for in it thou camest out from Egypt : and none shall appeare before me emptie :
And the feast of haruest , the first fruits of thy labours , which thou hast sowen in the field : and the feast of ingathering which is in the end of the yeere , when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field .
Three times in the yeere all thy males shall appeare before the Lord God .
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leauened bread , neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remaine vntill the morning .
The first of the first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God : thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milke .
¶ Behold , I send an Angel before thee to keepe thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I haue prepared .
Beware of him , and obey his voice , prouoke him not : for he will not pardon your transgressions : for my name is in him .
But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and doe all that I speake , then I wil be an enemie vnto thine enemies , and an aduersarie vnto thine aduersaries .
For mine Angel shall goe before thee , and bring thee in vnto the Amorites , and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , the Hiuites , and the Iebusites : and I will cut them off .
Thou shalt not bow downe to their gods , nor serue them , nor doe after their workes : but thou shalt vtterly ouerthrowe them , and quite breake downe their images .
And yee shall serue the Lord your God , and he shall blesse thy bread , and thy water : and I will take sicknes away from the midst of thee .
¶ There shall nothing cast their yong , nor bee barren in thy land : the number of thy dayes I will fulfill .
I will send my feare before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turne their backes vnto thee .
And I will send hornets before thee , which shall driue out the Hiuite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite from before thee .
I will not driue them out from before thee in one yeere , lest the land become desolate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
By little and little I will driue them out from before thee , vntill thou be increased and inherit the land .
And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea , euen vnto the sea of the Philistines , and from the desert vnto the riuer : for I will deliuer the inhabitants of the land into your hand : and thou shalt driue them out before thee .
Thou shalt make no couenant with them , nor with their gods .

And they saw the God of Israel : and there was vnder his feet , as it were a paued worke of a Saphire stone , and as it were the body of heauen in his clearenesse .
And vpon the Nobles of the children of Israel he layd not his hand : also they saw God , and did eate and drinke .

And Moses went vp into the Mount , and a cloud couered the Mount .
And the glory of the Lord abode vpon mount Sinai , and the cloud couered it sixe dayes : and the seuenth day hee called vnto Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like deuouring fire , on the top of the mount , in the eyes of the children of Israel .

And this is the offering which ye shall take of them ; Gold , and siluer , and brasse ,
And blew , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linnen , and goats haire :
And rammes skinnes died red , and badgers skinnes , and Shittim wood :
Oile for the light , spices for anointing oile , and for sweet incense :

According to all that I shew thee , after the patterne of the Tabernacle , and the patterne of all the instruments thereof , euen so shall ye make it .
¶ And they shall make an Arke of Shittim wood : two cubites and a halfe shalbe the length thereof , and a cubite and an halfe the breadth thereof , and a cubite & a halfe the height thereof .
And thou shalt ouerlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou ouerlay it : and shalt make vpon it a crowne of gold round about .

The staues shall be in the rings of the Arke : they shal not be taken from it .
And thou shalt put into the Arke the Testimonie which I shall giue thee .
And thou shalt make a Mercieseat of pure gold : two cubites and a halfe shalbe the length thereof , and a cubite and a halfe the breadth thereof . And thou shalt make two Cherubims of gold : of beaten worke shalt thou make them , in the two endes of the Mercie - seat .
And make one Cherub on the one end , and the other Cherub on the other end : euen of the Mercie - seat shall yee make the Cherubims , on the two ends thereof .
And the Cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high , couering the Mercie - seat with their wings , and their faces shall looke one to another : toward the Mercie - seat shall the faces of the Cherubims be .
And thou shalt put the Mercie - seat aboue vpon the Arke , and in the Arke thou shalt put the Testimonie that I shall giue thee .

And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come downe out of the mount , the people gathered themselues together vnto Aaron , and said vnto him , Up , make vs gods which shall goe before vs : for as for this Moses , the man that brought vs vp out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
And Aaron saide vnto them , Breake off the golden earerings which are in the eares of your wiues , of your sonnes , and of your daughters , and bring them vnto me .
And all the people brake off the golden earerings , which were in their eares , and brought them vnto Aaron .
And hee receiued them at their hand , and fashioned it with a grauing toole , after hee had made it a molten calfe : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt .
And when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it , and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the Lord .
And they rose vp early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings : and the people sate downe to eate and to drinke , and rose vp to play .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , Goe , get thee downe : for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt , haue corrupted themselues .
They haue turned aside quickly out of the way which I commaunded them : they haue made them a molten Calfe , and haue worshipped it , and haue sacrificed thereunto , and saide , These bee thy gods , O Israel , which haue brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , I haue seene this people , and behold , it is a stiffenecked people .
Now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may waxe hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
And Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doeth thy wrath ware hot against thy people , which thou hast brought foorth out of the land of Egypt , with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
Wherefore should the Egyptians speake and say , For mischiefe did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountaines , & to consume them from the face of the earth ? Turne from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this euill against thy people .
Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel thy seruants , to whom thou swarest by thine owne selfe , and saidest vnto them , I will multiply your seed as the starres of heauen : and all this land that I haue spoken of , will I giue vnto your seed , and they shall inherit it for euer .
And the Lord repented of the euill which he thought to doe vnto his people .
¶ And Moses turned , and went downe from the Mount , and the two Tables of the Testimony were in his hand : the Tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side , and on the other were they written .
And the Tables were the worke of God ; and the writing was the writing of God , grauen vpon the Tables .
And when Ioshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , hee said vnto Moses , There is a noise of warre in the campe .
And he said , It is not the voyce of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voyce of them that cry for being ouercome : but the noyse of them that sing doe I heare .
¶ And it came to passe , assoone as he came nigh vnto the campe , that he saw the Calfe , and the dancing : and Moses anger waxed hot , and he cast the Tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount .
And he tooke the Calfe which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it vpon the water , and made the children of Israel drinke of it .
And Moses said vnto Aaron , What did this people vnto thee , that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them ?
And Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord waxe hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischiefe .
For they said vnto me , Make vs gods which shall goe before vs : for as for this Moses , the man that brought vs vp out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
And I said vnto them , Whosoeuer hath any gold , let them breake it off : So they gaue it mee : then I cast it into the fire , & there came out this Calfe .
¶ And when Moses saw that the people were naked , ( for Aaron had made them naked vnto their shame , amongst their enemies )
Then Moses stood in the gate of the campe , and saide , Who is on the Lords side ? let him come vnto mee . And all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues together vnto him .
And hee said vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Put euery man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the campe , and slay euery man his brother , and euery man his companion , and euery man his neighbour .
And the children of Leui did according to the word of Moses ; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
For Moses had said , Consecrate your selues to day to the Lord , euen euery man vpon his sonne , and vpon his brother , that he may bestow vpon you a blessing this day .
¶ And it came to passe on the morrow , that Moses said vnto the people , Ye haue sinned a great sinne : And now I will goe vp vnto the Lord ; peraduenture I shall make an atonement for your sinne .
And Moses returned vnto the Lord , and said , Oh , this people haue sinned a great sinne , and haue made them gods of gold .
Yet now , if thou wilt forgiue their sinne ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy Booke , which thou hast written .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Whosoeuer hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my Booke .
Therefore now goe , leade the people vnto the place of which I haue spoken vnto thee : Behold , mine Angel shall goe before thee ; Neuerthelesse in the day when I visit , I will visit their sinne vpon them .

And the Lord said vnto Moses , Depart , and goe vp hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought vp out of the land of Egypt , vnto the land which I sware vnto Abraham , to Isaac , & to Iacob , saying , Unto thy seed will I giue it . And I will send an Angel before thee , and I will driue out the Canaanite , the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , the Hiuite , and the Iebusite :
Unto a land flowing with milke and hony : For I will not goe vp in the midst of thee : for thou art a stiffenecked people , lest I consume thee in the way .
¶ And when the people heard these euill tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
For the Lord had saide vnto Moses , Say vnto the children of Israel , Ye are a stiffenecked people : I wil come vp into the midst of thee in a moment , & consume thee : Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee , that I may know what to doe vnto thee .
And the children of Israel stript themselues of their ornaments , by the mount Horeb .
And Moses tooke the Tabernacle , & pitched it without the campe , a farre off from the campe , and called it the Tabernacle of the Congregation : And it came to passe , that euery one which sought the Lord , went out vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation , which was without the campe .
And it came to passe when Moses went out vnto the Tabernacle , that all the people rose vp , and stood euery man at his tent doore , and looked after Moses , vntill he was gone into the Tabernacle .
And it came to passe as Moses entred into the Tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the doore of the Tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle doore : and all the people rose vp , and worshipped euery man in his tent doore .
And the Lord spake vnto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh vnto his friend . And he turned againe into the campe , but his seruant Ioshua the sonne of Nun , a yong man , departed not out of the Tabernacle .
¶ And Moses saide vnto the Lord , See , thou sayest vnto mee , Bring vp this people , and thou hast not let mee know whome thou wilt send with me . Yet thou hast said , I knowe thee by name , and thou hast also found grace in my sight .
Now therefore , I pray thee , If I haue found grace in thy sight , shewe mee now thy way that I may know thee , that I may find grace in thy sight : and consider that this nation is thy people .
And he said , My presence shall go with thee , and I will giue thee rest .
And he said vnto him , If thy presence goe not with mee , carie vs not vp hence .
For wherein shall it bee knowen here , that I and thy people haue found grace in thy sight ? is it not in that thou goest with vs ? So shall we be separated , I and thy people , from all the people that are vpon the face of the earth .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , I will doe this thing also that thou hast spoken : for thou hast found grace in my sight , and I know thee by name .
And he said , I beseech thee , shew me thy glory .
And he said , I will make all my goodnesse passe before thee , and I will proclaime the name of the Lord before thee : and will bee gracious to whom I wil be gracious , and wil shew mercie on whom I will shew mercie .
And he said , Thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see mee , and liue .
And the Lord said , Beholde , there is a place by mee , and thou shalt stand vpon a rocke .
And it shall come to passe , while my glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a clift of the rocke , and will couer thee with my hand , while I passe by .

And the Lord said vnto Moses , Hew thee two Tables of stone , like vnto the first : and I will write vpon these Tables , the words that were in the first Tables which thou brakest .
And be ready in the morning , and come vp in the morning vnto mount Sinai , and present thy selfe there to me , in the top of the mount .
And no man shall come vp with thee , neither let any man bee seene throughout all the mount , neither let the flockes nor herds feede before that mount .
¶ And he hewed two Tables of stone , like vnto the first , and Moses rose vp earely in the morning , and went vp vnto mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , and tooke in his hand the two tables of stone .
And the Lord descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the Name of the Lord .
And the Lord passed by before him , and proclaimed , The Lord , The Lord God , mercifull and gracious , long suffering , and abundant in goodnesse and trueth ,
Keeping mercie for thousands , forgiuing iniquitie and transgression and sinne , and that will by no meanes cleere the guiltie , visiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children , and vpon the childrens children , vnto the third and to the fourth generation .
And Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
And he said , If now I haue found grace in thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee , goe amongst vs , ( for it is a stiffenecked people , ) and pardon our iniquitie , and our sinne , and take vs for thine inheritance .
¶ And he said , Behold , I make a couenant : before all thy people , I wil doe marueiles , such as haue not beene done in all the earth , nor in any nation : and all the people amongst which thou art , shall see the worke of the Lord : for it is a terrible thing that I will doe with thee .
Obserue thou that which I command thee this day : Behold , I driue out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hiuite , and the Iebusite .
Take heed to thy selfe , lest thou make a couenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee .
But ye shall destroy their altars , breake their images , and cut downe their groues .
For thou shalt worship no other god : for the Lord , whose name is Ielous , is a Ielous God :
Lest thou make a couenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they goe a whoring after their gods , and doe sacrifice vnto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eate of his sacrifice , And thou take of their daughters vnto thy sonnes , and their daughters goe a whoring after their gods , and make thy sonnes goe a whoring after their gods .
Thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
¶ The feast of vnleauened bread shalt thou keepe : Seuen dayes thou shalt eate vnleauened bread , as I commanded thee in the time of the moneth Abib : for in the moneth Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
All that openeth the matrixe is mine : and euery firstling amongst thy cattell , whether oxe or sheepe , that is male .
But the firstling of an Asse thou shalt redeeme with a lambe : and if thou redeeme him not , then shalt thou breake his necke . All the first borne of thy sonnes thou shalt redeeme : and none shall appeare before me empty .
¶ Sixe dayes thou shalt worke , but on the seuenth day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in haruest thou shalt rest .
¶ And thou shalt obserue the feast of weekes , of the first fruits of wheat haruest , and the feast of ingathering at the yeeres end .
¶ Thrice in the yeere shall all your men children appeare before the Lord God , the God of Israel .
For I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt goe vp to appeare before the Lord thy God , thrice in the yeere .
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leauen , neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of Passeouer be left vnto the morning .
The first of the first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring vnto the house of the Lord thy God . Thou shalt not seeth a kid in his mothers milke .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenour of these wordes , I haue made a couenant with thee , and with Israel .
And hee was there with the Lord forty dayes and forty nights : he did neither eat bread , nor drinke water ; and he wrote vpon the Tables the words of the couenant , the ten Commandements .

And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skinne of his face shone , and they were afraid to come nigh him .
And Moses called vnto them , and Aaron and all the rulers of the Congregation returned vnto him , and Moses talked with them .
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gaue them in commandement all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
And till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a vaile on his face .

Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations vpon the Sabbath day .

¶ And he tooke and put the testimony into the Arke , and set the staues on the Arke , and put the Mercie - seat aboue vpon the Arke .
And he brought the Arke into the Tabernacle , and set vp the Uaile of the couering , and couered the Arke of the Testimony , as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And hee put the Table in the Tent of the Congregation , vpon the side of the Tabernacle Northwaed , without the Uaile .
And he set the bread in order vpon it , before the Lord , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
¶ And he put the candlesticke in the Tent of the Congregation , ouer against the Table , on the side of the Tabernacle Southward .
And he lighted the lampes before the Lord , as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And he put the golden Altar in the Tent of the Congregation , before the Uaile .
And he burnt sweet incense thereon , as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And hee set vp the hanging , at the doore of the Tabernacle .
And he put the Altar of burnt offering by the doore of the Tabernacle of the Tent of the Congregation , and offered vpon it the burnt offering , and the meat offring , as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And he set the Lauer betweene the Tent of the Congregation and the Altar , & put water there , to wash withall .
And Moses , and Aaron and his sonnes , washed their hands , and their feet thereat .
When they went into the Tent of the Congregation , and when they came neere vnto the Altar , they washed , as the Lord commanded Moses .
And hee reared vp the Court round about the Tabernacle , and the Altar , & set vp the hanging of the Court gate : so Moses finished the worke .
¶ Then a cloud couered the Tent of the Congregation , and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle .
And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of the Congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle .
And when the cloud was taken vp from ouer the Tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their iourneys :
But if the cloud were not taken vp , then they iourneyed not , till the day that it was taken vp .

Now it came to passe in the thirtieth yeere , in the fourth moneth , in the fifth day of the moneth , ( as I was among the captiues by the riuer of Chebar ) that the heauens were opened , and I saw visions of God . In the fifth day of the moneth , ( which was the fifth yeere of king Iehoiakins captiuitie , )
The word of the Lord came expresly vnto Ezekiel the Priest , the sonne of Buzi , in the land of the Caldeans , by the riuer Chebar , and the hand of the Lord was there vpon him .
¶ And I looked , and behold , a whirlewinde came out of the North , a great cloude , and a fire infoulding it selfe , and a brightnesse was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber , out of the midst of the fire .
Also out of the midst thereof came the likenesse of foure liuing creatures , and this was their appearance : they had the likenesse of a man .
And euery one had foure faces , and euery one had foure wings .
And their feet were straight feet , and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calues foot , and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brasse .
And they had the handes of a man vnder their wings on their foure sides , and they foure had their faces and their wings .
Their wings were ioyned one to another , they turned not when they went : they went euery one straight forward .
As for the likenesse of their faces , they foure had the face of a man , and the face of a lyon on the right side , and they foure had the face of an oxe on the left side : they foure also had the face of an eagle .
Thus were their faces : and their wings were stretched vpward , two wings of euery one were ioyned one to an other , and two couered their bodies .
And they went euery one straight forward : whither the spirit was to goe , they went : and they turned not when they went .
As for the likenesse of the liuing creatures , their appearance was like burning coles of fire , and like the appearance of lamps : it went vp and downe among the liuing creatures , and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went foorth lightning .
And the liuing creatures ranne , and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
¶ Now as I behelde the liuing creatures : behold one wheele vpon the earth by the liuing creatures , with his foure faces .
The appearance of the wheeles , and their worke was like vnto the colour of a Berill : and they foure had one likenesse , and their appearance and their worke was as it were a wheele in the middle of a wheele .
When they went , they went vpon their foure sides : and they returned not when they went .
As for their rings , they were so high , that they were dreadful , and their rings were full of eyes round about them foure .
And when the liuing creatures went , the wheeles went by them : and when the liuing creatures were lift vp from the earth , the wheels were lift vp .
Whithersoeuer the spirit was to goe , they went , thither was their spirit to goe , and the wheeles were lifted vp ouer against them : for the spirit of the liuing creature was in the wheeles .
When those went , these went , and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted vp from the earth , the wheeles were lifted vp ouer against them : for the spirit of the liuing creature was in the wheeles .
And the likenesse of the firmament vpon the heads of the liuing creature was as the colour of the terrible chrystall , stretched foorth ouer their heads aboue .
And vnder the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other , euery one had two which couered on this side , & euery one had two , which couered on that side their bodies .
And when they went , I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almightie , the voice of speech , as the noise of an hoste : when they stood , they let downe their wings .
And there was a voice from the firmament , that was ouer their heads , when they stood , and had let downe their wings .
¶ And aboue the firmament that was ouer their heads , was the likenesse of a Throne , as the appearance of a Saphyre stone , and vpon the likenesse of the Throne was the likenesse as the appearance of a man aboue vpon it .
And I saw as the colour of amber , as the appearance of fire round about within it : from the appearance of his loynes euen vpward , and from the appearance of his loynes euen downeward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , & it had brightnesse round about .

And he said vnto me , Son of man , stand vpon thy feete , and I will speake vnto thee .
And the spirit entred into me , when hee spake vnto me , and set me vpon my feete , that I heard him that spake vnto me :
And hee said vnto me , Sonne of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against mee : they and their fathers haue transgressed against mee , euen vnto this very day .
For they are impudent children and stiffe hearted : I doe send thee vnto them , and thou shalt say vnto them , Thus sayth the Lord God .
And they , whether they wil heare or whether they will forbeare , ( for they are a rebellious house ) yet shall know that there hath bene a Prophet among them .
¶ And thou sonne of man , be not afraid of them , neither be afraid of their wordes , though bryars and thornes be with thee , and thou doest dwell among scorpions : be not afraid of their words , nor be dismayed at their lookes , though they be a rebellious house .
And thou shalt speake my words vnto them , whether they will heare or whether they will forbeare , for they are most rebellious .
But thou , sonne of man , heare what I say vnto thee ; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open thy mouth and eate that I giue thee .
¶ And when I looked , behold , an hand was sent vnto mee , and loe , a roule of a booke was therein .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer he said vnto me , Sonne of man , eate that thou findest : eate this roule , and goe , speake vnto the house of Israel .
So I opened my mouth , and hee caused me to eate that roule .
And he said vuto mee ; Sonne of man , cause thy belly to eate , and fill thy bowels with this roule that I giue thee . Then did I eate it , and it was in my mouth as honie for sweetnesse .
¶ And he said vnto me , Sonne of man , goe , get thee vnto the house of Israel , and speake with my words vnto them .
For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech , and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel .
Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not vnderstand : surely had I sent thee to them , they would haue hearkened vnto thee :
As an adamant harder then flint haue I made thy forehead : feare them not , neither be dismayed at their lookes , though they be a rebellious house .
Moreouer he said vnto me , Sonne of man , all my words that I shall speake vnto thee , receiue in thine heart , and heare with thine eares .
And goe , get thee to them of the captiuity , vnto thy people , and speake vnto them and tell them , Thus saith the Lord God , whether they will heare , or whether they will forbeare .
Then the spirit tooke me vp , and I heard behind me a voyce of a great rushing , saying Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place .
I heard also the noise of the wings of the liuing creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheeles ouer against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
So the spirit lifted me vp , and tooke me away , and I went in bitternesse , in the heate of my spirit , but the hand of the Lord was strong vpon mee .
¶ Then I came to them of the captiuity at Tel - abib , that dwelt by the riuer of Chebar , and I sate where they sate , and remained there astonished among them seuen daies .
And it came to passe at the end of seuen dayes , that the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , I haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel : therefore heare the word at my mouth , & giue them warning from me . When I say vnto the wicked ; Thou shalt surely die , and thou giuest him not warning , nor speakest to warne the wicked from his wicked way to saue his life ; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie : but his blood will I require at thine hand .
Yet if thou warne the wicked , and he turne not from his wickednesse , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity , but thou hast deliuered thy soule .
Againe , when a righteous man doth turne from his righteousnesse and commit iniquity , and I lay a stumbling blocke before him , he shall die : because thou hast not giuen him warning , he shall die in his sinne , and his righteousnesse which he hath done shal not be remembred : but his blood will I require at thine hand .
Neuerthelesse if thou warne the righteous man , that the righteous sinne not , and he doth not sinne ; he shall surely liue , because he is warned : also thou hast deliuered thy soule .
¶ And the hand of the Lord was there vpon me , and he said vnto me ; Arise , goe forth into the plaine , and I will there talke with thee .
Then I arose and went forth into the plaine , and behold , the glory of the Lord stood there as the glory which I saw by the riuer of Chebar , and I fell on my face .
Then the spirit entred into me , and set me vpon my feet , and spake with me , and said vnto me , Goe shut thy selfe within thine house .
But thou , O sonne of man , behold , they shall put bands vpon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not goe out among them .
And I will make thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumme and shalt not be to them a reprouer : for they are a rebellious house .

Thou also sonne of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray vpon it the citie , euen Ierusalem ,
And lay siege against it , and build a fort against it , and cast a mount against it : set the campe also against it , and set battering rammes against it round about .
Moreouer take thou vnto thee an yron panne , and set it for a wall of yron betweene thee and the city , and set thy face against it , and it shalbe besieged , and thou shalt lay siege against it : this shalbe a signe to the house of Israel .
And when thou hast accomplished them , lie againe on thy right side , and thou shalt beare the iniquitie of the house of Iudah fourtie dayes : I haue appointed thee each day for a yeere .
Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Ierusalem , and thine arme shalbe vncouered , and thou shalt prophecie against it .
And behold , I wil lay bands vpon thee , and thou shalt not turne thee from one side to an other , till thou hast ended the dayes of thy siege .
¶ Take thou also vnto thee wheat , and barley , and beanes , and lentils , and millet , and fitches , and put them in one vessell , and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the dayes that thou shalt lie vpon thy side ; three hundreth and ninetie dayes shalt thou eate thereof .
And thy meate which thou shalt eat , shalbe by weight twentie shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
Thou shalt drinke also water by measure , the sixt part of an hin : from time to time shalt thou drinke .
And thou shalt eate it as barley cakes , & thou shalt bake it with doung that commeth out of man in their sight .
And the Lord said , Euen thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles , whither I will driue them .
Then said I , Ah Lord God , behold , my soule hath not bene polluted : for from my youth vp euen til now , haue I not eaten of that which dieth of it selfe , or is torne in pieces , neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth .
Then he said vnto me , Loe , I haue giuen thee cowes doung for mans doung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith .
Moreouer he said vnto me , Sonne of man , behold , I wil breake the staffe of bread in Ierusalem , and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care , and they shal drinke water by measure , and with astonishment :

And thou sonne of man , take thee a sharpe knife , take thee a barbours rasor , and cause it to passe vpon thine head and vpon thy beard : then take the ballances to weigh , and diuide the haire .
Thou shalt burne with fire a third part in the midst of the city , when the dayes of the siege are fulfilled , and thou shalt take a third part , and smite about it with a knife , and a third part thou shalt scatter in the winde , and I will draw out a sword after them .
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
Then take of them againe , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burne them in the fire : for thereof shall a fire come foorth into all the house of Israel .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God ; This is Ierusalem : I haue set it in the midst of the nations and countreys that are round about her .
And she hath changed my iudgements into wickednesse more then the nations , and my statutes more then the countreyes that are round about her : for they haue refused my iudgements and my statutes , they haue not walked in them .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Because yee multiplied more then the nations that are round about you , and haue not walked in my Statutes , neither haue kept my iudgments , neither haue done according to the iudgements of the nations that are round about you :
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I , euen I am against thee , and will execute iudgements in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
And I will doe in thee that which I haue not done , and whereunto I will not doe any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
Therefore the fathers shall eate the sonnes in the midst of thee , and the sonnes shall eate their fathers , and I will execute iudgements in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the windes .
Wherefore , as I liue , saith the Lord God , Surely because thou hast defiled my Sanctuary with all thy detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also diminish thee , neither shall mine eye spare , neither will I haue any pitie .
¶ A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence , and with famine shall they be consumed in the middest of thee : and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee : and I will scatter a third part into all the windes , and I wil draw out a sword after them .
Thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest vpon them , and I will be comforted : and they shal know that I the Lord haue spoken it in my zeale , when I haue accomplished my fury in them .
Moreouer I will make thee waste , and a reproch among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that passe by .
So it shall bee a reproch and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment vnto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute iudgments in thee in anger and in furie , and in furious rebukes : I the Lord haue spoken it .
When I shall send vpon them the euill arrowes of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I wil increase the famine vpon you , and will breake your staffe of bread .

And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee , saying ,

And say , Ye mountaines of Israel , Heare the word of the Lord God , Thus saith the Lord God to the mountaines and to the hilles , to the riuers and to the valleys , Behold , I , euen I will bring a sword vpon you , and I will destroy your high places .
And your altars shalbe desolate , and your images shall be broken : and I will cast downe your slaine men before your idoles .
And I will lay the dead carkeises of the children of Israel before their idoles , and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste , and the high places shalbe desolate , that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate , and your idols may be broken and cease , and your images may bee cut downe , and your workes may be abolished .
And the slaine shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord .
¶ Yet will I leaue a remnant , that he may haue some , that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shalbe scattered through the countreys .
And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations , whither they shalbe caried captiues , because I am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me , and with their eyes which goe a whoring after their idoles : and they shall loathe themselues for the euils which they haue committed in all their abominations .
And they shall know that I am the Lord , and that I haue not said in vaine , that I would doe this euill vnto them .
¶ Thus sayth the Lord God ; Smite with thine hand , and stampe with thy foot , and say , Alas , for all the euill abominations of the house of Israel : for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
He that is farre off shall die of the pestilence , and he that is neere shall fall by the sword , and hee that remaineth and is besieged , shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my furie vpon them .
Then shal ye know that I am the Lord , when their slaine men shalbe among their idoles round about their altars , vpon euery high hill in all the tops of the mountaines , and vnder euery greene tree , and vnder euery thicke oke , the place where they did offer sweet sauour to all their idoles .

Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto mee , saying ;

Now is the ende come vpon thee , and I will send mine anger vpon thee , and will iudge thee according to thy wayes , and will recompense vpon thee all thine abominations .
And mine eye shal not spare thee , neither will I haue pitie : but I will recompense thy wayes vpon thee , and thine abominations shalbe in the midst of thee , and yee shall know that I am the Lord .
Thus sayth the Lord God , An euill , an onely euill , behold , is come . An end is come , the end is come , it watcheth for thee , behold , it is come .
The morning is come vnto thee , O thou that dwellest in the land : the time is come , the day of trouble is neere , and not the sounding againe of the mountaines .
Now will I shortly powre out my furie vpon thee , and accomplish mine anger vpon thee : and I wil iudge thee according to thy wayes , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
And mine eye shall not spare , neither will I haue pitie : I will recompense thee according to thy wayes , and thine abominations that are in the middest of thee , and yee shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth .
Behold the day , behold , it is come , the morning is gone foorth , the rodde hath blossomed , pride hath budded .
Uiolence is risen vp into a rod of wickednesse : none of them shall remaine , nor of their multitude , nor of any of theirs , neither shall there be wailing for them .
The time is come , the day draweth neere , let not the buyer reioyce , nor the seller mourne : for wrath is vpon all the multitude thereof .
For the seller shall not returne to that which is solde , although they were yet aliue : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shal not returne : neither shall any strengthen himselfe in the iniquity of his life .
They haue blowen the trumpet , euen to make all ready , but none goeth to the battell : for my wrath is vpon all the multitude thereof .
The sword is without , and the pestilence and the famine within : he that is in the field shall die with the sword , and hee that is in the city , famine and pestilence shall deuoure him .
¶ But they that escape of them , shall escape , and shall be on the mountaines like doues of the valleys , all of them mourning , euery one for his iniquitie .
All hands shall be feeble , and all knees shalbe weake as water .
They shall also girde themselues with sackcloth , and horrour shall couer them , and shame shall be vpon all faces , and baldnesse vpon all their heads .
They shall cast their siluer in the streets , and their golde shalbe remooued : their siluer and their golde shall not be able to deliuer them in the day of the wrath of the Lord : they shall not satisfie their soules , neither fill their bowels : because it is the stumbling blocke of their iniquitie .
¶ As for the beautie of his ornament , he set it in maiestie : but they made the images of their abominations , and of their detestable things therein : therefore haue I set it farre from them . And I will giue it into the hands of the strangers for a pray , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoile , and they shall pollute it .
My face will I turne also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it .
¶ Make a chaine : for the land is full of bloody crimes , the citie is full of violence .
Wherfore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possesse their houses : I will also make the pompe of the strong to cease , and their holy places shall be defiled .
Destruction commeth , and they shall seeke peace , and there shall be none .
Mischiefe shall come vpon mischiefe , and rumour shall be vpon rumour , then shall they seeke a vision of the prophet : but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsell from the ancients .

And it came to passe in the sixt yeere , in the sixt moneth , in the fift day of the month , as I sate in mine house , and the elders of Iudah sate before me ; that the hand of the Lord God fell there vpon me .
Then I beheld , and loe , a likenesse as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loines euen downeward , fire : and from his loines euen vpward , as the appearance of brightnesse , as the colour of amber .
And he put forth the forme of an hand , and tooke me by a locke of mine head , and the spirit lift me vp betweene the earth and the heauen , and brought me in the visions of God to Ierusalem , to the doore of the inner gate , that looketh toward the North , where was the seate of the image of ielousie , which prouoketh to ielousie .
And behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plaine .
¶ Then said he vnto me , Sonne of man , lift vp thine eyes now the way towards the North : so I lift vp mine eyes the way toward the North , and behold , Northward at the gate of the altar , this image of ielousie in the entry .
Then said he vnto me , Sonne of man , digge now in the wall : and when I had digged in the wall , behold a doore .
And he said vnto me , Goe in , and behold the wicked abominations that they doe heere .
So I went in and saw , and behold euery forme of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel purtrayed vpon the wall round about .
And there stood before them seuentie men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the middest of them stood Iaazaniah the sonne of Shaphan , with euery man his censer in his hand , and a thicke cloud of incense went vp .
Then said he vnto me , Sonne of man , hast thou seene what the ancients of the house of Israel doe in the darke , euery man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , The Lord seeth vs not , the Lord hath forsaken the earth .
¶ Hee said also vnto me , Turne thee yet againe , and thou shalt see greater abominations that they doe .
Then he brought me to the doore of the gate of the Lords house which was towards the North , and behold , there sate women weeping for Tammuz .
¶ Then said hee vnto me , Hast thou seene this , O sonne of man ? Turne thee yet againe , and thou shalt see greater abominations then these .
And he brought me into the inner court of the Lords house , and behold at the doore of the Temple of the Lord , betweene the porch and the altar , were about fiue and twentie men , with their backes toward the temple of the Lord , and their faces towards the East , and they worshipped the sunne towards the East .
¶ Then he said vnto me , Hast thou seene this , O sonne of man ? Is it a light thing to the house of Iudah , that they commit the abominations , which they commit heere ? for they haue filled the land with violence , and haue returned to prouoke me to anger : and loe , they put the branch to their nose .

Hee cryed also in mine eares , with a loude voyce , saying ; Cause them that hauecharge ouer the citie , to draw neere , euen euery man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
And behold , sixe men came from the way of the higher gate , which lyeth toward the North , and euery man a slaughter weapon in his hand : and one man among them was clothed with linnen , with a writers inkehorne by his side , and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar .
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone vp from the Cherub whereupon hee was , to the threshold of the house , and he called to the man clothed with linnen , which had the writers inkehorne by his side .
And the Lord sayd vnto him , Goe through the middest of the citie , through the middest of Ierusalem , and set a marke vpon the foreheads of the men that sigh , and that cry for all the abominations , that bee done in the middest thereof .
¶ And to the others he said in mine hearing , Goe ye after him through the citie , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither haue ye pitie .
Slay vtterly olde and yong ; both maides , and litle children , and women : but come not neere any man vpon whom is the marke , and begin at my sanctuary : then they began at the ancient men which were before the house .
And hee sayd vnto them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slaine , goe ye forth : and they went forth and slew in the citie .
¶ And it came to passe while they were slaying them , and I was left , that I fell vpon my face , and cryed and said , Ah , Lord God , wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel , in thy powring out of thy fury vpon Ierusalem ?
Then sayd he vnto me ; The iniquity of the house of Israel and Iudah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the citie full of peruersenesse : for they say ; The Lord hath forsaken the earth , and the Lord seeth not .
And as for me also , mine eye shal not spare , neither will I haue pitie , but I will recompence their way vpon their head .

Then I looked , and beholde , in the firmament that was aboue the head of the Cherubims , there appeared ouer them as it were a Saphir stone , as the appearance of the likenesse of a throne .
And hee spake vnto the man clothed with linnen , and sayd , Goe in between the wheeles , euen vnder the Cherub , and fill thine hand with coales of fire from betweene the Cherubims , and scatter them ouer the city . And he went in my sight .
Now the Cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in , and the cloud filled the inner court .
Then the glory of the Lord went vp from the Cherub , and stood ouer the threshold of the house , and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightnesse of the Lords glory .
And the sound of the Cherubims wings was heard euen to the vtter court , as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh .
And it came to passe that when he had commanded the man clothed with linnen , saying ; Take fire from betweene the wheeles , from betweene the Cherubims ; then he went in and stood beside the wheeles .
And one Cherub stretched forth his hand from betweene the Cherubims vnto the fire that was betweene the Cherubims : and tooke thereof , and put it into the handes of him that was clothed with linnen , who tooke it , and went out .
¶ And there appeared in the Cherubims , the forme of a mans hand vnder their wings . And when I looked , behold the foure wheeles by the Cherubims , one wheele by one Cherub , and an other wheele by an other Cherub : and the appearance of the wheeles was as the colour of a Berill stone .
And as for their appearances , they foure had one likenes as if a wheele had bene in the midst of a wheele .
When they went , they went vpon their foure sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place whither the head looked , they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
And their whole body , and their backes , and their handes , and their wings , and the wheeles , were ful of eyes round about , euen the wheeles that they foure had .
As for the wheeles , it was cried vnto them in my hearing , O wheele .
And euery one had foure faces : the first face was the face of a Cherub , and the second face was the face of a man , and the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
And the Cherubims were lifted vp , this is the liuing creature that I saw by the riuer of Chebar .
And when the Cherubims went , the wheeles went by them : and when the Cherubims lift vp their wings , to mount vp from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
When they stood , these stood , and when they were lifted vp , these lift vp themselues also : for the spirit of the liuing creature was in them .
Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house , and stood ouer the Cherubims .
And the Cherubims lift vp their wings , and mounted vp from the earth in my sight : when they went out , the wheeles also were besides them , and euery one stood at the doore of the East gate of the Lords house , and the glorie of the God of Israel was ouer them aboue .
This is the liuing creature that I saw vnder the God of Israel , by the riuer of Chebar , and I knew that they were the Cherubims .

Moreouer the Spirit lift me vp , and brought me vnto the East gate of the Lords house , which looketh Eastward : and behold at the doore of the gate fiue and twenty men ; among whom I saw Iaazaniah the sonne of Azur , and Pelatiah the sonne of Benaiah , Princes of the people .
Then said he vnto me ; Sonne of man , these are the men that deuise mischiefe , & giue wicked counsel in this city .
Which say , It is not neere , let vs build houses : this citie is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
¶ Therefore prophecie against them , prophecie , O sonne of man .
And the Spirit of the Lord fell vpon me , and said vnto me , Speake , thus saith the Lord ; Thus haue ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your minde , euery one of them .
Ye haue multiplyed your slaine in this citie , and yee haue filled the streetes thereof with the slaine .
Therefore thus sayth the Lord God ; Your slaine whom ye haue laid in the middest of it , they are the flesh , and this citie is the cauldron : but I wil bring you foorth out of the middest of it .
Ye haue feared the sword , and I will bring a sword vpon you , saith the Lord God .
And I will bring you out of the middest thereof , and deliuer you into the hands of strangers , and will execute iudgements among you .
Yee shall fall by the sword , I will iudge you in the border of Israel , and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
This citie shall not be your cauldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the middest thereof , but I will iudge you in the border of Israel .
And ye shall know that I am the Lord : for yee haue not walked in my statutes , neither executed my iudgements , but haue done after the maners of the heathen that are round about you .
¶ And it came to passe , when I prophecied , that Pelatiah the sonne of Benaiah died : then fell I downe vpon my face , and cried with a loud voice , and said ; Ah Lord God , wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel ?
Againe the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , thy brethren , euen thy brethren , the men of thy kinred , and all the house of Israel wholly are they , vnto whom the inhabitants of Ierusalem haue sayd ; Get yee farre from the Lord : vnto vs is this land giuen in possession .
Therefore say , Thus sayth the Lord God ; Although I haue cast them farre off among the heathen , and although I haue scattered them among the countreys , yet will I be to them as a little Sanctuarie in the countreys where they shall come .
Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord God ; I will euen gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countreys where ye haue beene scattered , and I will giue you the land of Israel .
And they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof , and all the abominations thereof from thence .
And I wil giue them one heart , and I wil put a new spirit within you : and I will take the stonie heart out of their flesh , and will giue them an heart of flesh ,
That they may walke in my statutes , and keepe mine ordinances , and doe them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things , and their abominations , I wil recompense their way vpon their owne heads , saith the Lord God .
¶ Then did the Cherubims lift vp their wings , and the wheeles besides them , and the glory of the God of Israel was ouer them aboue .
And the glory of the Lord went vp from the middest of the citie , and stood vpon the mountaine , which is on the East side of the citie .
¶ Afterwards the spirit tooke me vp , and brought me in vision by the spirit of God into Caldea to them of the captiuity : so the vision that I had seene , went vp from me .

The word of the Lord also came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , thou dwellest in the middest of a rebellious house , which haue eyes to see , and see not : they haue eares to heare , and heare not : for they are a rebellious house .
Therefore thou sonne of man , prepare thee stuffe for remoouing , and remooue by day in their sight , and thou shalt remoue from thy place to another place in their sight ; it may be they will consider , though they bee a rebellious house .
Then shalt thou bring foorth thy stuffe by day in their sight , as stuffe for remoouing : and thou shalt goe foorth at euen in their sight , as they that goe foorth into captiuitie .
Digge thou through the wall in their sight , and cary out thereby .
In their sight shalt thou beare it vpon thy shoulders , and cary it foorth in the twy light : thou shalt couer thy face , that thou see not the ground : for I haue set thee for a signe vnto the house of Israel .
And I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuffe by day , as stuffe for captiuity , and in the euen I digged through the wall with mine hand , I brought it foorth in the twy light , and I bare it vpon my shoulder in their sight .
¶ And in the morning came the word of the Lord vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , hath not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , sayd vnto thee , What doest thou ?
Say thou vnto them ; Thus saith the Lord God ; This burden concerneth the Prince in Ierusalem , and all the house of Israel that are among them .
Say , I am your signe : like as I haue done , so shall it be done vnto them : they shall remooue and goe into captiuitie .
And the Prince that is among them , shall beare vpon his shoulder in the twylight , and shall goe forth : they shall digge through the wall to cary out thereby : he shall couer his face , that he see not the ground with his eyes .
My net also will I spread vpon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I wil bring him to Babylon to the land of the Caldeans , yet shall hee not see it , though he shall die there .
And I will scatter toward euery winde all that are about him to helpe him , and all his bands , and I wil draw out the sword after them .
And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shal scatter them among the nations , and disperse them in the countreys .
But I will leaue a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence , that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come , and they shall know that I am the Lord .
¶ Moreouer , the worde of the Lord came to me , saying ;
Sonne of man , eate thy bread with quaking , and drinke thy water with trembling and with carefulnesse ,
And say vnto the people of the land ; Thus sayth the Lord God , of the inhabitants of Ierusalem , and of the land of Israel ; They shall eat their bread with carefulnes , and drinke their water with astonishment , that her land may be desolate from all that is therein , because of the violence of them that dwell therein .
And the cities that are inhabited , shall be laid waste , and the land shall be desolate , and yee shall know that I am the Lord .
¶ And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , what is that prouerbe , that ye haue in the land of Israel , saying ; The dayes are prolonged , and euery vision faileth ?
Tell them therefore , Thus sayth the Lord God ; I will make this prouerbe to cease , and they shall no more vse it as a prouerbe in Israel : but say vnto them , The dayes are at hand , and the effect of euery vision .
For there shall bee no more any vaine vision , nor flattering diuination , within the house of Israel .
For I am the Lord : I will speake , & the word that I shall speake , shall come to passe : it shall be no more prolonged : for in your dayes , O rebellious house , will I say the word , and will performe it , sayth the Lord God .
¶ Againe the word of the Lord came to me , saying ;
Sonne of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say ; The vision that he seeth is for many dayes to come , and he prophecieth of the times that are far off .
<NON-VERSE>
And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee , saying ;
Sonne of man , prophecie against the Prophets of Israel that prophecie , and say thou vnto them that prophecie out of their owne hearts , Heare ye the word of the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord God ; Woe vnto the foolish prophets , that follow their owne spirit , and haue seene nothing .
O Israel , thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts .
Yee haue not gone vp into the gaps , neither made vp the hedge for the house of Israel , to stand in the battell in the day of the Lord .
They haue seene vanity , and lying diuination , saying ; The Lord saith , and the Lord hath not sent them : and they haue made others to hope , that they would confirme the word . Haue ye not seene a vaine vision , and haue ye not spoken a lying diuination , whereas yee say , The Lord sayth it , albeit I haue not spoken ?
Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye haue spoken vanity and seene lyes , therefore behold , I am against you , saith the Lord God .
And mine hand shall be vpon the Prophets that see vanitie , and that diuine lyes : they shall not bee in the assembly of my people , neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel , neither shall they enter into the land of Israel , and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
¶ Because , euen because they haue seduced my people , saying ; Peace , and there was no peace : and one built vp a wall , and loe , others dawbed it with vntempered morter ,
Say vnto them which dawbe it with vntempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall bee an ouerflowing showre , and yee , O great haile stones , shal fall , and a stormie wind shal rent it .
Loe , when the wall is fallen , shall it not bee sayde vnto you ; Where is the dawbing wherwith ye haue dawbed it ?
Therefore thus sayth the Lord God ; I will euen rent it with a stormie wind in my fury : and there shall be an ouerflowing showre in mine anger , and great hailestones in my fury , to consume it .
So wil I breake downe the wall that ye haue dawbed with vntempered morter , & bring it downe to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discouered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consumed in the middest thereof : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
Thus will I accomplish my wrath vpon the wall , and vpon them that haue dawbed it with vntempered morter , and will say vnto you ; The wall is no more , neither they that dawbed it :
To wit , the Prophets of Israel which prophecie concerning Ierusalem , and which see visions of peace for her , and there is no peace , sayth the Lord God .
¶ Likewise thou sonne of man , set thy face against the daughters of thy people ; which prophecie out of their owne heart , and prophecie thou against them ,
And say , Thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the women that sow pillowes to all arme holes , and make kerchiefes vpon the head of euery stature to hunt soules : Will ye hunt the soules of my people , and will yee saue the soules aliue that come vnto you ?
And will yee pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley , and for pieces of bread , to slay the soules that should not die , and to saue the soules aliue that should not liue , by your lying to my people that heare your lyes ?
Wherefore thus sayth the Lord God , Behold , I am against your pillowes , wherewith yee there hunt the soules to make them flie , and I will teare them from your armes , and will let the soules goe , euen the soules that ye hunt to make them flie .
Your kerchiefes also will I teare , and deliuer my people out of your hand , and they shalbe no more in your hand to be hunted , and yee shall know that I am the Lord .
Because with lyes yee haue made the heart of the righteous sad whom I haue not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that hee should not returne from his wicked way by promising him life :

Then came certaine of the Elders of Israel vnto me , and sate before me .
And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , these men haue set vp their idoles in their heart , and put the stumbling blocke of their iniquitie before their face : should I be enquired of at all by them ?
Therefore speake vnto them , and say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Euery man of the house of Israel that setteth vp his idoles in his heart , and putteth the stumbling blocke of his iniquitie before his face , and commeth to the Prophet , I the Lord will answere him that commeth , according to the multitude of his idoles ,
That I may take the house of Israel in their owne heart , because they are all estranged from mee through their idoles .
¶ Therefore say vnto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God , Repent , and turne your selues from your idoles , and turne away your faces from all your abominations .
For euery one of the house of Israel , or of the stranger that soiourneth in Israel , which separateth himselfe from me , and setteth vp his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumbling blocke of his iniquitie before his face , and commeth to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me , I the Lord will answere him by my selfe .
And I wil set my face against that man , and will make him a signe and a prouerbe , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people , and yee shall know that I am the Lord .
And if the prophet bee deceiued when hee hath spoken a thing , I the Lord haue deceiued that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand vpon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
And they shall beare the punishment of their iniquitie : the punishment of the prophet shall bee euen as the punishment of him that seeketh vnto him :
That the house of Israel may goe no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may bee their God , sayeth the Lord God .
¶ The word of the Lord came againe to me , saying ,
Sonne of man , when the land sinneth against mee by trespassing grieuously , then will I stretch out mine hand vpon it , and will breake the staffe of the bread thereof , and will send famine vpon it , and will cut off man and beast from it .
Though these three men , Noah , Daniel and Iob were in it , they should deliuer but their owne soules by their righteousnes , saith the Lord God .
¶ If I cause noisome beastes to passe through the land , and they spoile it , so that it bee desolate , that no man may passe through because of the beasts :
Though these three men were in it , as I liue , saith the Lord God , they shall deliuer neither sonnes nor daughters : they onely shalbe deliuered , but the land shalbe desolate .
¶ Or if I bring a sword vpon that land , and say , Sword , goe through the lande , so that I cut off man and beast from it :
Though these three men were in it , as I liue , saith the Lord God , they shall deliuer neither sonnes nor daughter , but they onely shall bee deliuered themselues .
¶ Or if I send a pestilence into that land , and powre out my fury vpon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast :
Though Noah , Daniel and Iob were in it , as I liue , saith the Lord God , they shal deliuer neither son nor daughter : they shall but deliuer their owne soules by their righteousnes .
For thus saith the Lord God , How much more when I send my foure sore iudgements vpon Ierusalem ; the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
¶ Yet behold , therein shalbe left a remnant that shalbe brought foorth , both sonnes and daughters : behold , they shall come foorth vnto you , and ye shall see their way and their doings : and ye shalbe comforted concerning the euill that I haue brought vpon Ierusalem , euen concerning all that I haue brought vpon it .

And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying .
Sonne of man , What is the Uine tree more then any tree , or then a branch which is among the trees of the forrest ?
Shall wood bee taken thereof to doe any worke ? or , will men take a pin of it , to hang any vessell thereon ?
Behold , it is cast into the fire for fewell : the fire deuoureth both the ends of it , and the middest of it is burnt . Is it meete for any worke ?
Behold , when it was whole it was meete for no worke : how much lesse shall it be meete yet for any worke , when the fire hath deuoured it , and it is burned ?
¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; As the Uine tree among the trees of the forrest , which I haue giuen to the fire for fewell , so will I giue the inhabitants of Ierusalem .
And I will set my face against them , they shall goe out from one fire , and another fire shall deuoure them , and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them .

Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Son of man , cause Ierusalem to know her abominations ,
And say , Thus saith the Lord God vnto Ierusalem ; Thy birth and thy natiuitie is of the land of Canaan , thy father was an Amorite , and thy mother an Hittite .
And as for thy natiuity in the day thou wast borne , thy nauell was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee : thou wast not salted at all , nor swadled at all .
None eye pitied thee to doe any of these vnto thee , to haue compassion vpon thee , but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of thy person , in the day that thou wast borne .
¶ And when I passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine owne blood , I said vnto thee when thou wast in thy blood , Liue : yea I said vnto thee when thou wast in thy blood , Liue .
I haue caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field , and thou hast increased and waxen great , and thou art come to excellent ornaments : thy breasts are fashioned , and thine haire is growen , whereas thou wast naked and bare .
Now when I passed by thee , and looked vpon thee , behold , thy time was the time of loue , and I spread my skirt ouer thee , and couered thy nakednesse : yea , I sware vnto thee , and entred into a couenant with thee , sayth the Lord God , and thou becamest mine .
Then washed I thee with water : yea , I throughly washed away thy blood from thee , and I anointed thee with oyle .
I clothed thee also with broidred worke , & shod thee with badgers skin , and I girded thee about with fine linen , and I couered thee with silke .
I decked thee also with ornaments , and I put bracelets vpon thine hands , and a chaine on thy necke .
And I put a iewell on thy forehead , and eare - rings in thine eares , and a beautifull crowne vpon thine head .
Thus wast thou decked with gold and siluer , and thy raiment was of fine linen & silke , and broidered worke , thou didst eate fine floure and honie and oyle , and thou wast exceeding beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdome .
And thy renowme went foorth among the heathen for thy beautie : for it was perfect through my comelinesse which I had put vpon thee , sayth the Lord God .
¶ But thou diddest trust in thine owne beauty , and playedst the harlot , because of thy renowne , and powredst out thy fornications on euery one that passed by ; his it was .
And of thy garments thou diddest take , and deckedst thy high places with diuers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
Thou hast also taken thy faire iewels of my gold and of my siluer , which I had giuen thee , and madest to thy selfe images of men , and diddest commit whoredome with them ,
And tookest thy broidered garments and coueredst them : and thou hast set mine oyle and mine incense before them .
My meate also which I gaue thee , fine flowre , and oyle , and honie wherewith I fed thee , thou hast euen set it before them for a sweete sauour : and thus it was , saith the Lord God .
Moreouer thou hast taken thy sonnes and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne vnto me , and these hast thou sacrificed vnto them to be deuoured : is this of thy whoredomes a small matter ,
That thou hast slaine my children , and deliuered them to cause them to passe through the fire for them ?
And in all thine abominations and thy whooredomes , thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in thy blood .
And it came to passe after all thy wickednesse ( woe , woe vnto thee , saith the Lord God . ) That thou hast also built vnto thee an eminent place , and hast made thee an high place in euery streete .
Thou hast built thy high place at euery head of the way , and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened thy feete to euery one that passed by , and multiplied thy whooredomes .
Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours great of flesh , & hast increased thy whooredomes , to prouoke me to anger .
Thou hast moreouer multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan vnto Caldea , and yet thou wast not satisfied heerewith .
How weake is thine heart , saith the Lord God , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an imperious whorish woman ?
In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of euery way , and makest thine high place in euery streete , and hast not beene as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire :
But as a wife that committeth adulterie , which taketh strangers in steede of her husband .
They giue gifts to all whores , but thou giuest thy gifts to all thy louers , and hyrest them , that they may come vnto thee on euery side for thy whoredome .
And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredomes , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredomes : and in that thou giuest a reward , and no reward is giuen vnto thee : therefore thou art contrary .
¶ Wherefore , O harlot , heare the word of the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord God ; Because thy filthinesse was powred out , and thy nakednesse discouered through thy whoredomes with thy louers , and with all the idols of thy abominations , and by the blood of thy children , which thou diddest giue vnto them ,
Behold therefore , I will gather all thy louers , with whom thou hast taken pleasure , and all them that thou hast loued , with all them that thou hast hated : I will euen gather them round about against thee , and will discouer thy nakednesse vnto them , that they may see all thy nakednesse .
And I will iudge thee , as women that breake wedlocke and shead blood are iudged , and I will giue thee blood in fury and iealousie .
And I will also giue thee into their hand , and they shal throw downe thine eminent place , and shall breake downe thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy faire iewels , and leaue thee naked and bare .
They shall also bring vp a companie against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee thorough with their swords .
And they shall burne thine houses with fire , and execute iudgements vpon thee in the sight of many women : and I wil cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt giue no hire any more .
So will I make my fury towards thee to rest , and my iealousie shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
Because thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth , but hast fretted mee in all these things ; behold therefore , I also will recompence thy way vpon thine head , saith the Lord God : and thou shalt not commit this lewdnesse , aboue all thine abominations .
¶ Behold , euery one that vseth prouerbs , shall vse this prouerbe against thee , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
Thou art thy mothers daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children , and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their husbands , and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
And thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters , that dwell at thy left hand : and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
Yet hast thou not walked after their wayes , nor done after their abominations : but as if that were a very litle thing , thou wast corrupted more then they in all thy wayes .
As I liue , saith the Lord God , Sodom thy sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and thy daughters .
Behold , this was the iniquitie of thy sister Sodom ; Pride , fulnesse of bread , and aboundance of idlenesse was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poore and needy .
And they were hautie , and committed abomination before me : therefore I tooke them away , as I saw good .
Neither hath Samaria committed halfe of thy sinnes , but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more then they , and hast iustified thy sisters in all thine abominations , which thou hast done .
Thou also which hast iudged thy sisters , beare thine owne shame for thy sinnes , that thou hast committed more abominable then they : they are more righteous then thou : yea be thou confounded also , and beare thy shame , in that thou hast iustified thy sisters .
When I shall bring againe their captiuitie , the captiuitie of Sodom and her daughters , and the captiuitie of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring againe the captiuity of thy captiues in the midst of them ;
That thou mayest beare thine owne shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort vnto them .
When thy sisters , Sodom and her daughters shal returne to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall returne to their former estate , then thou and thy daughters shall returne to your former estate .
For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ;
Before thy wickednesse was discouered , as at the time of thy reproch of the daughters of Syria , and all that are round about her , the daughters of the Philistines which despise thee round about .
Thou hast borne thy lewdnesse , and thine abominations , saith the Lord .
For thus saith the Lord God ; I will euen deale with thee as thou hast done , which hast despised the oath in breaking the couenant .
¶ Neuerthelesse I will remember my couenant with thee in the dayes of thy youth , and I will establish vnto thee an euerlasting couenant .
Then thou shalt remember thy wayes and be ashamed , when thou shalt receiue thy sisters , thine elder and thy younger , and I will giue them vnto thee for daughters , but not by thy couenant .
And I will establish my couenant with thee , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord :

And the word of the Lord came vnto mee , saying ,
Sonne of man , put foorth a riddle , and speake a parable vnto the house of Israel ,
And say , Thus saith the Lord God , A great eagle with great wings , long wing ' d , full of feathers , which had diuers colours , camevnto Lebanon , and tooke the highest branch of the Cedar .
Hee cropt off the top of his yong twigs , and caried it into a land of traffique ; he set it in a city of merchants .
Hee tooke also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitfull field , he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
And it grew , and became a spreading Uine of low stature , whose branches turned toward him , and the roots thereof were vnder him : so it became a Uine , and brought forth branches , and shot foorth sprigges .
There was also an other great eagle , with great wings and many feathers , and behold , this Uine did bend her rootes towards him , and shot forth her branches toward him , that hee might water it by the furrowes of her plantation .
It was planted in a good soile by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might beare fruit , that it might be a goodly Uine .
Say thou , Thus saith the Lord God ; Shall it prosper ? shall he not pull vp the rootes thereof , and cut off the fruit thereof , that it wither ? it shall wither in all the leaues of her spring , euen without great power , or many people to plucke it vp by the rootes thereof .
Yea behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? shall it not vtterly wither , when the East wind toucheth it ? it shal wither in the furrowes where it grew .
¶ Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Say now to the rebellious house , Know ye not what these things meane ? tell them , behold , the king of Babylon is come to Ierusalem , and hath taken the King thereof , and the Princes thereof , and ledde them with him to Babylon ,
And hath taken of the kings seed , and made a couenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land ,
That the kingdome might bee base , that it might not lift it selfe vp , but that by keeping of his Couenant it might stand .
But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadours into Egypt , that they might giue him horses and much people : shall he prosper ? shall he escape that doeth such things ? or shall hee breake the Couenant , and bee deliuered ?
As I liue , saith the Lord God , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose couenant he brake , euen with him , in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
Neither shall Pharaoh with his mightie armie and great companie make for him in the warre by casting vp mounts , and building forts , to cut off many persons .
Seeing hee despised the oath by breaking the couenant ( when loe , he had giuen his hand ) and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , As I liue , surely mine oath that he hath despised , and my Couenant that he hath broken , euen it will I recompense vpon his owne head .
And I will spread my net vpon him , & he shalbe taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespasse , that he hath trespassed against me .
And all his fugitiues , with all his bands , shall fall by the sword , and they that remaine shalbe scattered towards all windes : and ye shall know that I the Lord haue spoken it .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God , I wil also take of the highest branch of the high Cedar , and will set it , I will croppe off from the top of his yong twigges a tender one , and will plant it vpon an high mountaine and eminent .
In the mountaine of the height of Israel will I plant it : and it shall bring foorth boughes , and beare fruite , and be a goodly Cedar , and vnder it shall dwell all foule of euery wing : in the shadow of the branches thereof shal they dwell .

And the word of the Lord came vnto me againe , saying ;
What meane ye that yee vse this prouerbe concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers haue eaten sowre grapes , and the childrens teeth are set on edge ?
As I liue , saith the Lord God , yee shall not haue occasion any more to vse this prouerbe in Israel .
Behold , all soules are mine , as the soule of the father , so also the soule of the sonne is mine : the soule that sinneth , it shall die .
¶ But if a man be iust , and do that which is lawfull and right :
And hath not eaten vpon the mountaines , neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idoles of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbours wife , neither hath come neere to a menstruous woman ,
And hath not oppressed any , but hath restored to the debtourhis pledge , hath spoiled none by violence , hath giuen his bread to the hungrie , and hath couered the naked with a garment ,
He that hath not giuen foorth vpon vsurie , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawen his hand from iniquitie , hath executed true iudgement betweene man and man ,
And that doeth not any of those duties , bnt euen hath eaten vpon the mountains , and defiled his neighbours wife ,
Hath oppressed the poore and needie , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lift vp his eyes to the idoles , hath committed abomination ,
Hath giuen foorth vpon vsurie , and hath taken encrease : shall he then liue ? hee shall not liue : hee hath done all these abominations , hee shall surely die , his blood shalbe vpon him .
¶ Now loe , if hee beget a sonne that seeth all his fathers sinnes which he hath done , and considereth , and doth not such like ,
That hath not eaten vpon the mountaines , neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idoles of the house of Israel , hath not defiled his neighbours wife ,
As for his father , because hee cruelly oppressed , spoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , loe , euen he shall die in his iniquitie .
¶ Yet say yee , Why ? doeth not the sonne beare the iniquitie of the father ? when the sonne hath done that which is lawfull and right , and hath kept all my Statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely liue .
The soule that sinneth , it shal die : the sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the father , neither shal the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne ; the righteousnesse of the righteous shall bee vpon him , and the wickednesse of the wicked shalbe vpon him .
But if the wicked will turne from all his sinnes that he hath committed and keepe all my statutes , and doe that which is lawful and right , he shall surely liue , he shall not die .
All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned vnto him : in his righteousnesse , that he hath done , he shall liue .
Haue I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die , saith the Lord God ? And not that he should returne from his wayes , and liue ?
¶ But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousnes , & committeth iniquitie , and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth , shall he liue ? all his righteousnesse that he hath done , shall not be mentioned : in his trespasse that he hath trespassed , and in his sinne that he hath sinned , in them shall he die .
¶ Yet yee say ; The way of the Lord is not equall . Heare now , O house of Israel ; Is not my way equall ? are not your wayes vnequall ?
When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnesse , & committeth iniquitie , and dieth in them ; for his iniquitie that he hath done , shall he die .
Againe , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickednesse that he hath committed , and doth that which is lawfull and right , he shall saue his soule aliue .
Because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely liue , he shall not die .
Yet saith the house of Israel ; The way of the Lord is not equall . O house of Israel , are not my wayes equall ? are not your wayes vnequall ?
Therefore I will iudge you , O house of Israel , euery one according to his wayes , saith the Lord God ; repent , and turne your selues from all your transgressions : so iniquitie shall not be your ruine .
¶ Cast away from you all your transgressions , wherby yee haue transgressed , and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will yee die , O house of Israel ?

Moreouer , take thou vp a lamentation for the princes of Israel ,
And say , What is thy mother ? a lyonesse : shee lay downe among lions , she nourished her whelpes among yong lions .
And shee brought vp one of her whelps : it became a yong lion , & it learned to catch the pray , it deuoured men .
The nations also heard of him , hee was taken in their pit , and they brought him with chaines vnto the land of Egypt .
Now when she saw that shee had waited , and her hope was lost , then she tooke another of her whelps , and made him a yong lion .
And he went vp and downe among the lions , he became a yong lion , and learned to catch the pray , and deuoured men .
And he knew there desolate palaces , and he laied waste their cities , and the land was desolate , and the fulnesse thereof by the noise of his roaring .
Then the nations set against him on euery side from the prouinces , and spread their net ouer him : he was taken in their pit .
And they put him in ward in chaines , and brought him to the king of Babylon , they brought him into holds , that his voyce should no more be heard vpon the mountaines of Israel .
¶ Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood , planted by the waters , she was fruitfull and full of branches by reason of many waters ,
And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that beare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thicke branches , & she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
But she was plucked vp in fury : she was cast downe to the ground , and the East wind dryed vp her fruite : her strong rods were broken and withered , the fire consumed them .
And now she is planted in the wildernesse , in a dry and thirsty ground .

And it came to passe in the seuenth yeere , in the fift moneth , the tenth day of the moneth , that certaine of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the Lord , and sate before me .
Then came the word of the Lord vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , speake vnto the elders of Israel , and say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , Are yee come to enquire of me ? As I liue , saith the Lord God , I will not be enquired of by you .
Wilt thou iudge them , sonne of man , wilt thou iudge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers :
¶ And say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted vp mine hand vnto the seed of the house of Iacob , and made my selfe knowen vnto them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted vp mine hand vnto them , saying , I am the Lord your God ,
In the day that I lifted vp mine hand vnto them to bring them foorth of the land of Egypt , into a lande that I had espied for them , flowing with milke and hony , which is the glory of all lands :
Then said I vnto them , Cast ye away euery man the abominations of his eyes , and defile not your selues with the idoles of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
But they rebelled against me , and would not hearken vnto mee : they did not euery man cast away the abominations of their eyes , neither did they forsake the idoles of Egypt : then I said , I will powre out my furie vpon them , to accomplish my anger against them in the middest of the land of Egypt .
But I wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen , among whom they were , in whose sight I made my selfe knowen vnto them , in bringing them foorth out of the land of Egypt .
¶ Wherefore I caused them to goe foorth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wildernesse .
And I gaue them my statutes , and shewed them my iudgements , which if a man doe , he shall euen liue in them .
Moreouer also , I gaue them my Sabbaths , to be a signe betweene mee and them , that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctifie them .
But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernesse : they walked not in my statutes , and they despised my iudgements , which if a man doe , hee shall euen liue in them , and my sabbaths they greatly polluted : then I said I would powre out my furie vpon them in the wildernesse , to consume them :
But I wrought for my names sake , that it should not bee polluted before the heathen , in whose sight I brought them out .
Yet also I lifted vp my hand vnto them in the wildernesse , that I would not bring them into the land which I had giuen them , flowing with milke and hony , which is the glory of all lands ,
Because they despised my iudgements , and walked not in my statutes , but polluted my Sabbaths : for their heart went after their idoles .
Neuerthelesse , mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the wildernes .
But I said vnto their children in the wildernesse ; Walke ye not in the statutes of your fathers , neither obserue their iudgements , nor defile your selues with their idoles .
I am the Lord your God : walke in my statutes , and keepe my iudgements and doe them :
And hallow my Sabbaths , and they shall be a signe betweene mee and you , that yee may know that I am the Lord your God .
Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me : they walked not in my statutes , neither kept my iudgements to doe them , which if a man doe , hee shall euen liue in them ; they polluted my Sabbaths : then I said I would powre out my furie vpon them , to accomplish my anger against them in the wildernesse .
Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names sake , that it should not be polluted in the fight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them foorth .
I lifted vp mine hand vnto them also in the wildernesse , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countreys ;
Because they had not executed my iudgements , but had despised my Statutes , and had polluted my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers idoles .
Wherefore I gaue them also statutes that were not good , and iudgements whereby they should not liue .
And I polluted them in their owne gifts , in that they caused to passe through the fire all that openeth the wombe , that I might make them desolate , to the end , that they might know that I am the Lord .
¶ Therefore sonne of man , speake vnto the house of Israel , and say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , Yet in this your fathers haue blasphemed me , in that they haue committed a trespasse against me .
For when I had brought them into the land , for the which I lifted vp mine hand to giue it to them , then they saw euery high hill , and all the thicke trees , and they offered there their sacrifices , and there they presented the prouocation of their offering : there also they made their sweet sauour , and powred out there their drinke offerings .
Then I said vnto them , What is the high place whereunto ye goe ? and the name thereof is called Bamah vnto this day .
Wherefore say vnto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God , Are ye polluted after the maner of your fathers ? and commit ye whoredome after their abominations ?
For when yee offer your gifts , when yee make your sonnes to passe through the fire , ye pollute your selues with all your idoles euen vnto this day : and shall I be inquired of by you , O house of Israel ? As I liue , saith the Lord God , I will not be inquired of by you .
And that which commeth into your minde , shall not be at all , that ye say , We wil be as the heathen , as the families of the countreys , to serue wood and stone .
¶ As I liue , sayeth the Lord God , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arme , and with furie powred out , will I rule ouer you .
And I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countreys wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , & with a stretched out arme , and with fury powred out .
And I wil bring you into the wildernes of the people , and there will I plead with you face to face .
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wildernes of the land of Egypt , so wil I plead with you , saith the Lord God .
And I will cause you to passe vnder the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Couenant .
And I will purge out from among you the rebels , and them that transgresse against mee : I will bring them foorth out of the countrey where they soiourne , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel , and yee shall know that I am the Lord .
As for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord God , Goe yee , serue ye euery one his idoles , and hereafter also , if ye wil not hearken vnto me : but pollute ye my holy Name no more with your gifts , and with your idoles .
For in mine holy mountaine , in the mountaine of the height of Israel , saith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land serue me : there will I accept them , and there wil I require your offerings , and the first fruits of your oblations , with all your holy things .
I will accept you with your sweet sauour , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countreys wherein yee haue bene scattered , and I wil be sanctified in you before the heathen .
And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the countrey for the which I lifted vp mine hand , to giue it to your fathers .
And there shall yee remember your wayes , & all your doings , wherein ye haue bene defiled , and ye shal lothe your selues in your owne sight , for all your euils that ye haue committed .
And ye shal know that I am the Lord , when I haue wrought with you for my Names sake , not according to your wicked wayes , nor according to your corrupt doings , O yee house of Israel , saith the Lord God .
¶ Moreouer , the worde of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , set thy face toward the South , and drop thy word toward the South , and prophesie against the forrest of the South field .
And say to the forest of the South , Heare the word of the Lord : Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , I will kindle a fire in thee , and it shall deuoure euery greene tree in thee , and euery dry tree : the flaming flame shal not be quenched , and all faces from the South to the North shalbe burnt therein .
And all flesh shall see that I the Lord haue kindled it : it shall not be quenched .

And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , set thy face toward Ierusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy places , and prophecie against the land of Israel ,
And say to the land of Israel , Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword goe forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the South to the North :
That all flesh may know , that I the Lord haue drawen foorth my sword out of his sheath : it shall not returne any more .
Sigh therefore thou sonne of man with the breaking of thy loynes , and with bitternesse sigh before their eyes .
And it shall be , when they say vnto thee ; Wherefore sighest thou ? that thou shalt answere , For the tidings , because it commeth : and euery heart shall melt , and all hands shalbe feeble , and euery spirit shal faint , and all knees shal be weake as water : behold , it commeth , and shalbe brought to passe , sayth the Lord God .
¶ Againe , the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , prophecie and say , Thus sayth the Lord , Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also fourbished . It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is fourbished , that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? It contemneth the rod of my sonne , as euery tree .
And he hath giuen it to be fourbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is fourbished to giue it into the hand of the slayer .
Cry and howle , sonne of man , for it shalbe vpon my people , it shalbe vpon all the princes of Israel : terrours , by reason of the sword , shall be vpon my people : smite therefore vpon thy thigh .
Because it is a tryall , and what if the sword contemne euen the rodde ? it shall be no more , sayth the Lord God .
Thou therefore sonne of man , prophecie and smite thine hands together , and let the sword bee doubled the third time , the sword of the slaine , it is the sword of the great men , that are slaine , which entreth into their priuie chambers .
I haue set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruines be multiplied . Ah , it is made bright , it is wrapt vp for the slaughter .
Goe thee one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , whithersoeuer thy face is set .
I will also smite mine hands together , and I wil cause my furie to rest : I the Lord haue sayd it .
¶ The word of the Lord came vnto me againe , saying ,
Also thou sonne of man , appoint thee two wayes , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come : both twaine shall come forth out of one land : and choose thou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the citie .
Appoint a way , that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites , and to Iudah in Ierusalem the defenced .
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way , at the head of the two wayes , to vse diuination : he made his arrowes bright , he consulted with images , he looked in the liuer .
At his right hand was the diuination for Ierusalem to appoint captaines , to open the mouth in the slaughter , to lift vp the voice with shouting , to appoint battering - rammes against the gates , to cast a mount and to build a fort .
And it shall be vnto them as a false diuination in their sight , to them that haue sworne oathes : but he will call to remembrance the iniquitie , that they may be taken .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Because yee haue made your iniquitie to be remembred , in that your transgressions are discouered , so that in all your doings your sinnes doe appeare : because , I say , that yee are come to remembrance , yee shall be taken with the hand .
¶ And thou prophane wicked prince of Israel , whose day is come , when iniquitie shall haue an end ,
Thus saith the Lord God , Remoue the diademe , and take off the crowne : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
I will ouerturne , ouerturne , ouerturne it , and it shall be no more , vntill he come , whose right it is , and I wil giue it him .
¶ And thou sonne of man , prophecie , and say , Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites , and concerning their reproch : Euen say thou ; The sword , the sword is drawen , for the slaughter it is fourbished , to consume because of the glittering :
Whiles they see vanitie vnto thee , whiles they diuine a lie vnto thee , to bring thee vpon the necks of them that are slaine , of the wicked whose day is come , when their iniquitie shall haue an end .
Shall I cause it to returne into his sheath ? I will iudge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy natiuitie .
And I will powre out mine indignation vpon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliuer thee into the hand of brutish men and skilfull to destroy .

Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Now thou sonne of man , wilt thou iudge , wilt thou iudge the bloodie citie ? yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations .
Then say thou , Thus saith the Lord God ; The citie sheadeth blood in the middest of it , that her time may come , and maketh idoles against herselfe to defile herselfe .
Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed , and hast defiled thy selfe in thine idoles , which thou hast made , and thou hast caused thy daies to draw neere , and art come euen vnto thy yeeres ; therfore haue I made thee a reproch vnto the heathen , and a mocking to all countries .
Those that be neere , and those that be farre from thee , shall mocke thee which art infamous , and much vexed .
Behold the princes of Israel , euerie one were in thee to their power to shead blood . In thee haue they set light by father and mother : in the middest of thee haue they dealt by oppression with the stranger : in thee haue they vexed the fatherlesse and the widow :
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife , and an other hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law , and an other in thee hath humbled his sister , his fathers daughter .
In thee haue they taken gifts to shead blood : thou hast taken vsury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , saith the Lord God .
¶ Behold therefore , I haue smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gaine which thou hast made , and at thy blood which hath bene in the midst of thee .
Can thine heart indure , or can thine hands be strong in the dayes that I shall deale with thee ? I the Lord haue spoken it , and will doe it .
And I will scatter thee among the heathen , and disperse thee in the countreys , and will consume thy filthinesse out of thee .
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thy selfe in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , the house of Israel is to me become drosse : all they are brasse , and tinne , and yron , and lead in the midst of the furnace : they are euen the drosse of siluer .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Because ye are all become drosse , behold therefore I will gather you into the midst of Ierusalem .
As they gather siluer , and brasse , and yron , and lead , and tinne into the midst of the furnace , to blow the fire vpon it , to melt it : so will I gather you in mine anger , and in my fury , and I will leaue you there , and melt you .
Yea , I will gather you , and blow vpon you in the fire of my wrath , and ye shalbe melted in the midst thereof .
As siluer is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the middest thereof , and ye shall know that I the Lord haue powred out my furie vpon you .
¶ And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Son of man , say vnto her , Thou art the land that is not cleansed , nor rained vpon in the day of indignation .
There is a conspiracie of her prophets in the middest thereof like a roaring lyon , rauening the praye : they haue deuoured soules : they haue taken the treasure and precious things : they haue made her many widowes in the midst thereof .
Her priests haue violated my law , and haue prophaned mine holy things : they haue put no difference betweene the holy and prophane , neither haue they shewed difference between the vncleane and the cleane , and haue hid their eyes from my Sabbaths , and I am prophaned among them .
Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolues rauening the praye , to shed blood , and to destroy soules , to get dishonest gaine .
And her prophets haue dawbed them with vntempered morter , seeing vanity , and diuining lies vnto them , saying , Thus saith the Lord God , when the Lord hath not spoken .
The people of the land haue vsed oppression , and exercised robbery , and haue vexed the poore and needie : yea , they haue oppressed the stranger wrongfully .
And I sought for a man among them , that should make vp the hedge , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it : but I found none .

Sonne of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother . And they committed whordomes in Egypt , they committed whordomes in their youth : there were their brests pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginitie .
And the names of them were Aholah the elder , and Aholibah her sister : and they were mine , & they bare sonnes and daughters : thus were their names : Samaria is Aholah , and Ierusalem Aholibah .
And Aholah played the harlot , when she was mine , & she doted on her louers , on the Assyrians her neighbors ,
Which were clothed with blew , captaines and rulers , all of them desireable yong men , horsemen riding vpon horses .
Thus she committed her whordomes with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted , with all their idoles she defiled her selfe .
Neither left she her whoredomes brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginitie , and powred their whoredome vpon her .
Wherefore I haue deliuered her into the hand of her louers , into the hand of the Assyrians , vpon whom she doted .
These discouered her nakednes , they tooke her sonnes and her daughters , and slew her with the sword : and she became famous among women , for they had executed iudgement vpon her .
And when her sister Aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate loue then she , and in her whoredoms more then her sister in her whoredomes .
She doted vpon the Assyrians her neighbours , captaines and rulers clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding vpon horses , all of them desireable young men .
Then I saw that she was defiled , that they tooke both one way ;
And that she increased her whoredomes : for when shee saw men pourtrayed vpon the wall , the images of the Caldeans pourtrayed with vermilion ,
Girded with girdles vpon their loynes , exceeding in dyed attire vpon their heads , all of them princes to looke to , after the maner of the Babylonians of Caldea , the land of their natiuitie :
And assoone as shee saw them with her eyes , she doted vpon them , and sent messengers vnto them into Caldea .
And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue , and they defiled her with their whoredome , and shee was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
So shee discouered her whoredomes , and discouered her nakednesse ; then my mind was alienated from her , like as my minde was alienated from her sister .
Yet shee multiplied her whoredomes , in calling to remembrance the dayes of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
For she doted vpon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdnesse of thy youth , in bruising thy teates by the Egyptians , for the paps of thy youth .
¶ Therefore , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I will raise vp thy louers against thee , from whom thy minde is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on euery side ;
The Babylonians , and all the Caldeans , Pekod , and Shoah , and Koa , all the the Assyrians with them , all of them desireable young men , captaines and rulers , great lords and renowmed , all of them riding vpon horses .
And they shall come against thee with charets , wagons and wheeles , and with an assemblie of people which shall set against thee buckler , and shield , and helmet round about : and I will set iudgement before them , and they shal iudge thee according to their iudgements .
And I will set my ielousie against thee , and they shall deale furiously with thee : they shall take away thy nose and thine eares , and thy remnant shall fall by the sword : they shall take thy sonnes and thy daughters , and thy residue shal be deuoured by the fire .
They shall also strippe thee out of thy clothes , and take away thy faire iewels .
Thus will I make thy lewdnesse to cease from thee , and thy whoredome brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
For thus saith the Lord God ; Beholde , I will deliuer thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest ; into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated .
And they shall deale with thee hatefully , and shall take away all thy labour , and shall leaue thee naked and bare , and the nakednesse of thy whoredomes shall bee discouered , both thy lewdnesse and thy whoredomes .
I wil doe these things vnto thee , because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen , and because thou art polluted with their idoles .
Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister , therefore will I giue her cup into thine hand .
Thus sayth the Lord God , Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cuppe deepe and large : thou shalt be laughed to scorne and had in derision ; it containeth much .
Thou shalt be filled with drunkennesse and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister Samaria .
Thou shalt euen drinke it and sucke it out , and thou shalt breake the sheards thereof , and plucke off thine owne breasts : for I haue spoken it , saith the Lord God .
Therefore thus sayth the Lord God , Because thou hast forgotten me , and cast me behinde thy backe , therfore beare thou also thy lewdnesse , and thy whoredomes .
¶ The Lord said moreouer vnto mee , Sonne of man , wilt thou iudge Aholah and Aholibah ? yea declare vnto them their abominations ;
That they haue committed adulterie , and blood is in their handes , and with their idoles haue they committed adulterie , and haue also caused their sonnes , whom they bare vnto me , to passe for them through the fire to deuoure them .
Moreouer this they haue done vnto me : they haue defiled my Sanctuarie in the same day , and haue profaned my Sabbaths .
For when they had slaine their children to their idoles , then they came the same day into my Sanctuarie to profane it , and loe , thus haue they done in the middest of mine house .
And furthermore that yee haue sent for men to come from farre , vnto whom a messenger was sent , and loe they came ; for whom thou didst wash thy selfe , paintedst thy eyes , and deckedst thy selfe with ornaments ,
And satest vpon a stately bedde , and a table prepared before it , whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oile .
And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her , and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wildernesse , which put bracelets vpon their hands , and beautifull crownes vpon their heads .
Then said I vnto her that was olde in adulteries ; Will they now commit whoredomes with her , and shee with them ?
Yet they went in vnto her , as they goe in vnto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in vnto Aholah & vnto Aholibah the lewd women .
¶ And the righteous men , they shall iudge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their handes .
For thus sayth the Lord God , I will bring vp a company vpon them , and will giue them to be remoued and spoiled .
And the companie shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords : they shall slay their sonnes and their daughters , and burne vp their houses with fire .
Thus will I cause lewdnesse to cease out of the land , that all women may be taught not to doe after your lewdnesse .

Againe in the ninth yeere , in the tenth moneth , in the tenth day of the moneth , the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , Write thee the name of the day , euen of this same day : the king of Babylon set himselfe against Ierusalem this same day .
And vtter a parable vnto the rebellious house , and say vnto them , Thus sayth the Lord God , Set on a pot , set it on , and also powre water into it .
Gather the pieces thereof into it , euen euery good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
Take the choice of the flocke , and burne also the bones vnder it , and make it boyle well , and let him seethe the bones of it therein .
¶ Wherefore thus sayth the Lord God , Woe to the bloodie citie , to the pot whose scumme is therein , and whose scumme is not gone out of it ; bring it out piece by piece , let no lot fall vpon it .
For her blood is in the middest of her : she set it vpon the toppe of a rocke , she powred it vpon the ground to couer it with dust :
That it might cause furie to come vp to take vengeance : I haue set her blood vpon the top of a rocke , that it should not be couered .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the bloody citie , I will euen make the pile for fire , great .
Heape on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burnt .
Then set it empty vpon the coales thereof , that the brasse of it may be hot and may burne , and that the filthinesse of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
She hath wearied herselfe with lies , and her great scumme went not forth out of her : her scumme shall be in the fire .
In thy filthinesse is lewdnesse , because I haue purged thee , and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from thy filthinesse any more , till I haue caused my fury to rest vpon thee .
I the Lord haue spoken it , it shall come to passe , and I will doe it , I will not goe backe , neither will I spare , neither will I repent , according to thy wayes and according to thy doings , shall they iudge thee , saith the Lord God .
¶ Also the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourne , nor weepe , neither shall thy teares runne downe .
Forbeare to crie , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head vpon thee , and put on thy shooes vpon thy feete , and couer not thy lips , and eate not the bread of men .
So I spake vnto the people in the morning , and at euen my wife died , and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
¶ And the people said vnto me ; Wilt thou not tell vs what these things are to vs , that thou doest so ?
Then I answered them , The word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Speake vnto the house of Israel ; Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , I will prophane my sanctuarie , the excellencie of your strength , the desire of your eyes , and that which your soule pitieth ; and your sonnes and your daughters , whom yee haue left , shall fall by the sword .
And yee shall doe as I haue done : yee shall not couer your lips , nor eate the bread of men .
And your tires shall be vpon your heads , and your shooes vpon your feet : yee shall not mourne nor weepe , but yee shall pine away for your iniquities , and mourne one towards an other .
Thus Ezekiel is vnto you a signe : according to all that he hath done , shall yee doe : and when this commeth , yee shall know that I am the Lord God .
Also thou sonne of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the ioy of their glorie , the desire of their eyes , and that whereupon they set their minds , their sonnes and their daughters ;
That he that escapeth in that day , shall come vnto thee , to cause thee to heare it with thine eares ?

The word of the Lord came againe vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , set thy face against the Ammonites , and prophecie against them ,
And say vnto the Ammonites ; Heare the word of the Lord God , Thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou saidst , Aha , against my sanctuarie , when it was prophaned , and against the land of Israel , when it was desolate , & against the house of Iudah , when they went into captiuitie ;
Behold therefore , I will deliuer thee to the men of the East for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eate thy fruit , and they shall drinke thy milke .
And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks : and ye shal know that I am the Lord .
For thus saith the Lord God , Because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feete , and reioyced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel :
Behold therefore , I will stretch out mine hand vpon thee , and will deliuer thee for a spoile to the heathen , and I will cut thee off from the people , and I wil cause thee to perish out of the countreys : I will destroy thee , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God , Because that Moab and Seir doe say , Behold , the house of Iudah is like vnto all the heathen :
Therefore beholde , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the countrey Beth - ieshimoth , Baal - meon and Kiriathaim ,
Unto the men of the East with the Ammonites , and will giue them in possession , that the Ammonites may not be remembred among the nations .
And I will execute iudgments vpon Moab , and they shall know that I am the Lord .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God , Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Iudah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and reuenged himselfe vpon them :
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , I will also stretch out mine hand vpon Edom , and will cut off man and beast from it , and I will make it desolate from Teman , and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword .
And I will lay my vengeance vpon Edom by the hand of my people Israel , and they shall doe in Edom according to mine anger , and according to my furie , and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord God .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God , Because the Philistines haue dealt by reuenge , and haue taken vengeance with a despiteful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred :

Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I am against thee , O Tyrus , and will cause many nations to come vp against thee , as the sea causeth his waues to come vp .
And they shall destroy the walles of Tyrus , and breake downe her towres : I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her like the top of a rocke .
It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the middest of the sea : for I haue spoken it , saith the Lord God , and it shall become a spoile to the nations .
And her daughters which are in the field shall be slaine by the sword , and they shall know that I am the Lord .
¶ For thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , I will bring vpon Tyrus , Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , a king of kings , from the North , with horses , and with charets , and with horsemen , and companies , and much people .
Hee shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field , and he shal make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift vp the buckler against thee .
Hee shall set engines of warre against thy walles , and with his axes he shall breake downe thy towres .
By reason of the abundance of his horses , their dust shall couer thee : thy walles shall shake at the noise of the horsemen , and of the wheeles , and of the charets , when he shall enter into thy gates , as men enter into a citie wherein is made a breach .
With the hoofes of his horses shall he tread downe all thy streets : he shall slay thy people by the sword , and thy strong garisons shall goe downe to the ground .
And they shall make a spoile of thy riches , and make a pray of thy merchandise , and they shall breake downe thy walles , and destroy thy pleasant houses , and they shall lay thy stones , and thy timber , and thy dust in the midst of the water .
And I wil cause the noise of thy songs to cease , and the sound of thy harpes shalbe no more heard .
And I will make thee like the top of a rocke : they shall bee a place to spread nets vpon : thou shalt bee built no more : for I the Lord haue spoken it , saith the Lord God .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus ; Shall not the Iles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded crie , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
Then all the Princes of the sea shall come downe from their thrones , and lay away their robes , and put off their broidred garments : they shall cloth themselues with trembling , they shall sit vpon the ground , and shall tremble at euery moment , and be astonished at thee .
And they shall take vp a lamentation for thee , and say to thee , How art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of Sea - faring men , the renowned citie , which wast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , which cause their terrour to be on all that haunt it ?
Now shall the Iles tremble in the day of thy fall , yea the Iles that are in the sea , shall bee troubled at thy departure .
For thus saith the Lord God ; When I shal make thee a desolate citie , like the cities that are not inhabited , when I shall bring vp the deepe vpon thee , and great waters shall couer thee ;
When I shall bring thee downe , with them that descend into the pit , with the people of old time , and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth , in places desolate of olde , with them that goe downe to the pit , that thou bee not inhabited , and I shall set glorie in the land of the liuing :

Thy borders are in the midst of the seas , thy builders haue perfected thy beautie . They haue made all thy shippe bords of firre trees of Senir : they haue taken Cedars from Lebanon , to make mastes for thee .
Of the okes of Bashan haue they made thine oares : the companie of the Ashurites haue made thy benches of Yuorie , brought out of the Iles of Chittim .
Fine linnen with broidred worke from Egypt , was that which thou spreddest forth to be thy saile , blew and purple from the Iles of Elishah was that which couered thee .
The inhabitants of Zidon and Aruad were thy mariners : thy wise men , O Tyrus , that were in thee , were thy pilots .
The ancients of Gebal , and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers , all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee , to occupie thy merchandise .

Behold , thou art wiser then Daniel : there is no secret that they can hide from thee .
With thy wisedome and with thine vnderstanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and siluer into thy treasures .
By thy great wisedome , and by thy traffique hast thou increased thy riches , and thine heart is lifted vp because of thy riches .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God ;
Behold therefore , I will bring strangers vpon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beautie of thy wisedome , & they shall defile thy brightnesse .
They shall bring thee downe to the pit , and thou shalt die the deaths of them , that are slaine in the middest of the seas .
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and no God in the hand of him that slayeth thee .

Thou art the annointed Cherub that couereth : and I haue set thee so ; thou wast vpon the holy mountaine of God ; thou hast walked vp and downe in the middest of the stones of fire .
Thou wast perfect in thy wayes from the day that thou wast created , till iniquitie was found in thee .
By the multitude of thy merchandise they haue filled the middest of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore I will cast thee as prophane out of the mountaine of God : and I wil destroy thee , O couering Cherub , from the middest of the stones of fire .
Thine heart was lifted vp because of thy beautie , thou hast corrupted thy wisedome by reason of thy brightnesse : I will cast thee to the ground : I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities , by the iniquitie of thy traffique : therefore will I bring forth a fire from the middest of thee , it shall deuoure thee : and I will bring thee to ashes vpon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee .

Speake and say , Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I am against thee , Pharaoh king of Egypt , the great dragon that lieth in the middest of his riuers , which hath saide , My riuer is mine owne , and I haue made it for my selfe .
But I will put hookes in thy chawes , and I will cause the fish of thy riuers to sticke vnto thy scales , and I will bring thee vp out of the middest of thy riuers , and all the fish of thy riuers shall sticke vnto thy scales .
And I will leaue thee throwen into the wildernes , thee and all the fish of thy riuers : thou shalt fall vpon the open fields , thou shalt not be brought together , nor gathered : I haue giuen thee for meat to the beastes of the field , and to the foules of the heauen .
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord , because they haue bene a staffe of reede to the house of Israel .
When they tooke hold of thee by thy hand , thou didst breake , and rent all their shoulder : and when they leaned vpon thee , thou brakest , and madest all their loynes to be at a stand .
¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I will bring a sword vpon thee , and cut off man and beast out of thee .
And the land of Egypt shalbe desolate and waste , and they shall knowe that I am the Lord : because he hath saide , The riuer is mine , and I haue made it .
Beholde therefore , I am against thee , and against thy riuers , and I wil make the land of Egypt vtterly waste and desolate , from the towre of Syene euen vnto the border of Ethiopia .
No foot of man shal passe through it , nor foote of beast shall passe through it , neither shall it bee inhabited fourtie yeeres .
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countreys that are desolate , and her cities among the cities that are layed waste , shall be desolate fourtie yeeres : and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and wil disperse them through the countreys .
¶ Yet thus saith the Lord God , At the end of fourtie yeeres will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered .
And I will bring againe the captiuitie of Egypt , and will cause them to returne into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation , and they shall be there a base kingdome .
It shall be the basest of the kingdomes , neither shall it exalt it selfe any more aboue the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule ouer the nations .
And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance , when they shall looke after them : but they shall know that I am the Lord God .

And the sword shall come vpon Egypt , and great paine shalbe in Ethiopia , when the slaine shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shalbe broken downe .
Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shal fal with them by the sword .
Thus saith the Lord , They also that vphold Egypt shall fall , and the pride of her power shall come downe : from the towre of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord God .
And they shall bee desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shalbe in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I haue set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroied .
In that day shall messengers goe foorth from me in shippes , to make the carelesse Ethiopians afraid , and great paine shall come vpon them , as in the day of Egypt : for loe , it commeth .
Thus saith the Lord God , I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchad - rezzar , king of Babylon .
He and his people with him , the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slaine .
And I will make the riuers drie , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked , and I wil make the land wast , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I the Lord haue spoken it .
Thus saith the Lord God , I will also destroy the idoles , and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph : and there shalbe no more a Prince of the land of Egypt , and I will put a feare in the land of Egypt .
And I wil make Pathros desolate , and wil set fire in Zoan , and will execute iudgements in No .
And I wil powre my furie vpon Sin , the strength of Egypt , and I wil cut off the multitude of No .
And I will set fire in Egypt , Sin shall haue great paine , and No shall be rent asunder , and Noph shall haue distresses daily .
The yong men of Auen and of Phibeseth , shall fall by the sword : and these cities shall goe into captiuitie .
At Tehaphnehes also the day shalbe darkened when I shall breake there the yokes of Egypt : & the pompe of her strength shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall couer her , and her daughters shall goe into captiuitie .

And I wil scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and wil disperse them through the countries .
And I wil strengthen the armes of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will breake Pharaohs armes , and he shall grone before him , with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .

¶ Behold , the Assyrian was a Cedar in Lebanon with faire branches , and with a shadowing shrowd , and of an hie stature , and his top was among the thicke boughes .
The waters made him great , the deepe set him vp on high with her riuers running round about his plants , and sent out her little riuers vnto all the trees of the field .
Therefore his height was exalted aboue all the trees of the field , and his boughes were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot foorth .
All the foules of heauen made their nests in his boughes , and vnder his branches did all the beastes of the field bring foorth their yong , and vnder his shadow dwelt all great nations .
Thus was hee faire in his greatnesse , in the length of his branches : for his roote was by great waters .
The Cedars in the garden of God could not hide him : the Firre trees were not like his boughes , and the chesnut trees were not like his branches : not any tree in the garden of God , was like vnto him in his beautie .
I haue made him faire by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , enuied him .
¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Because thou hast lifted vp thy selfe in height , and hee hath shot vp his top among the thicke boughes , and his heart is lifted vp in his height ;
I haue therefore deliuered him into the hand of the mightie one of the heathen : hee shall surely deale with him , I haue driuen him out for his wickednesse .
And strangers , the terrible of the nations haue cut him off , and haue left him : vpon the mountaines and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughes are broken by all the riuers of the land , and all the people of the earth are gone downe from his shadow , and haue left him .
Upon his ruine shal all the foules of the heauen remaine , & all the beasts of the field shalbe vpon his branches ,
To the ende that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselues for their height , neither shoot vp their top among the thicke boughes , neither their trees stand vp in their height , all that drinke water : for they are all deliuered vnto death , to the nether parts of the earth in the middest of the children of men , with them that go downe to the pit .
Thus saith the Lord God , In the day when hee went downe to the graue , I caused a mourning , I couered the deepe for him , and I restrained the floods therof , and the great waters were stayed ; and I caused Lebanon to mourne for him , and all the trees of the field fainted for him .
I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall , when I cast him downe to hell with them that descend into the pit : and all the trees of Eden , the choice and best of Lebanon , all that drinke water , shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth .
They also went downe into hell with him vnto them that be slaine with the sword , and they that were his arme , that dwelt vnder his shadow in the middest of the heathen .

Then will I leaue thee vpon the land , I will cast thee forth vpon the open field , and will cause all the foules of the heauen to remaine vpon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
And I will lay thy flesh vpon the mountaines , and fill the valleis with thy height .
I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , euen to the mountaines , and the riuers shall be full of thee .
And when I shall put thee out , I wil couer the heauen , and make the starres thereof darke : I will couer the sunne with a cloud , and the moone shall not giue her light .
All the bright lights of heauen will I make darke ouer thee , and set darkenesse vpon thy land , saith the Lord God .
I wil also vex the hearts of many people , when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not knowen .
Yea I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraide for thee , when I shall brandish my sword before them , and they shall tremble at euery moment ; euerie man for his owne life , in the day of thy fall .
¶ For thus saith the Lord God , The sword of the king of Babylon shal come vpon thee .
By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations all of them : and they shall spoile the pompe of Egypt , and all the multitude therof shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from besides the great waters , neither shall the foote of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofes of beasts trouble them .
Then will I make their waters deepe , and cause their riuers to runne like oyle , saith the Lord God .
When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the countrey shall be destitute of that wherof it was full ; when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shal they know that I am the Lord .

They shall fall in the middest of them that are slaine by the sword : she is deliuered to the sword ; draw her and all her multitudes .
The strong among the mighty shall speake to him out of the middest of hell with them that helpe him : they are gone downe , they lie vncircumcised , slaine by the sword .
Ashur is there , and all her companie : his graues are about him : al of them slaine , fallen by the sword .
Whose graues are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her graue : all of them slaine , fallen by the sword , which caused terrour in the land of the liuing .
There is Elam and all her multitude round about her graue , all of them slaine , fallen by the sword , which are gone downe vncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth , which caused their terrour in the lande of the liuing , yet haue they borne their shame with them that goe downe to the pit .
They haue set her a bed in the midst of the slaine with all her multitudes : her graues are round about him , all of them vncircumcised , slaine by the sword : though their terrour was caused in the land of the liuing , yet haue they borne their shame with them that goe downe to the pit : he is put in the midst of them that be slaine .
There is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude : her graues are round about him : all of them vncircumcised , slaine by the sword , though they caused their terrour in the land of the liuing .
And they shall not lie with the mightie , that are fallen of the vncircumcised , which are gone downe to hell with their weapons of warre : and they haue laid their swords vnder their heads , but their iniquities shalbe vpon their bones , though they were the terrour of the mightie in the land of the liuing .
Yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the vncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slaine with the sword .
There is Edom , her kings and all her princes , which with their might are laid by them that were slaine by the sword : they shall lie with the vncircumcised , and with them that go downe to the pit .
There be the princes of the North all of them , and all the Zidomans : which are gone downe with the slaine , with their terrour they are ashamed of their might , and they lie vncircumcised with them that be slaine by the sword , and beare their shame with them that goe downe to the pit .

If when he seeth the sword come vpon the land , hee blow the trumpet , and warne the people ,
Then whosoeuer heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning , if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be vpon his owne head .
Hee heard the sound of the trumpet , and tooke not warning , his blood shall be vpon him : but he that taketh warning , shall deliuer his soule .
But if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned : if the sword come and take any person from among them , he is taken away in his iniquitie : but his blood will I require at the watchmans hand .
¶ So thou , O sonne of man , I haue set thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel : therefore thou shalt heare the worde at my mouth , and warne them from me .
When I say vnto the wicked , O wicked man , thou shalt surely die , if thou doest not speake to warne the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquitie : but his blood will I require at thine hand .
Neuerthelesse if thou warne the wicked of his way to turne from it : if he do not turne from his way , he shal die in his iniquitie : but thou hast deliuered thy soule .
Therefore , O thou sonne of man , speake vnto the house of Israel , Thus ye speake , saying , If our transgressions and our sinnes be vpon vs , & we pine away in them , how should we then liue ?
Say vnto them , As I liue , saith the Lord God , I haue no pleasure in the death of the wicked , but that the wicked turne from his way & liue : turne ye , turne ye from your euill wayes , for why wil ye die , O house of Israel ?
Therefore thou sonne of man , say vnto the children of thy people , The righteousnes of the righteous shal not deliuer him in the day of his transgression : as for the wickednes of the wicked , he shall not fall thereby in the day that hee turneth from his wickednes , neither shall the righteous bee able to liue for his righteousnes in the day that he sinneth .
When I shal say to the righteous , that he shall surely liue if he trust to his owne righteousnes and commit iniquitie , all his righteousnesses shall not be remembred ; but for his iniquitie that he hath committed , he shall die for it .
Againe , when I say vnto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die , if hee turne from his sinne , and do that which is lawfull and right ;
If the wicked restore the pledge , giue againe that he had robbed , walke in the Statutes of life without committing iniquitie , hee shall surely liue , hee shall not die .
None of his sinnes that hee hath committed , shall be mentioned vnto him : he hath done that which is lawfull and right ; he shall surely liue .
¶ Yet the children of thy people say , The way of the Lord is not equall : but as for them , their way is not equall .
When the righteous turneth from his righteousnes , and committeth iniquitie , he shall euen die thereby .
But if the wicked turne from his wickednes , and doe that which is lawfull and right , he shall liue thereby .
¶ Yet yee say , The way of the Lord is not equall , O yee house of Israel ; I will iudge you euery one after his wayes .
¶ And it came to passe in the twelfth yeere of our captiuitie , in the tenth moneth , in the fifth day of the moneth , that one that had escaped out of Ierusalem , came vnto mee , saying , The city is smitten .
Now the hand of the Lord was vpon mee in the euening , afore hee that was escaped came , and had opened my mouth vntill hee came to mee in the morning , and my mouth was opened , and I was no more dumbe .
Then the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , they that inhabite those wastes of the land of Israel , speake , saying , Abraham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many , the land is giuen vs for inheritance .
Wherefore say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , Ye eate with the blood , and lift vp your eyes toward your idoles , and shed blood ; and shal ye possesse the land ?
Yee stand vpon your sword ; yee worke abomination , and ye defile euery one his neighbours wife , and shall ye possesse the land ?
Say thou thus vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , As I liue , surely they that are in the wastes , shall fall by the sword , and him that is in the open field will I giue to the beasts to be deuoured : and they that be in the forts and in the caues , shall die of the pestilence .
For I will lay the land most desolate , and the pompe of her strength shall cease : and the mountaines of Israel shall bee desolate , that none shall passe through .
Then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I haue layed the land most desolate , because of all their abominations which they haue committed .
¶ Also thou sonne of man , the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walles , and in the doores of the houses , and speake one to another , euery one to his brother , saying , Come , I pray you , and heare what is the word that commeth foorth from the Lord .
And they come vnto thee as the people commeth , and they sit before thee as my people , and they heare thy words , but they will not doe them : for with their mouth they shew much loue , but their heart goeth after their couetousnesse .
And loe , thou art vnto them as a very louely song of one that hath a pleasant voyce , and can play well on an instrument : for they heare thy wordes , but they doe them not .

And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Sonne of man , prophecie against the shepheards of Israel , prophecie and say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God vnto the shepheards , Woe be to the shepheards of Israel that doe feede themselues : should not the shepheards feede the flockes ?
Yee eate the fat , and ye clothe you with the wooll , yee kill them that are fed : but ye feede not the flocke .
My sheepe wandered through all the mountaines , and vpon euery high hill : yea my flocke was scattered vpon all the face of the earth , and none did search or seeke after them .
¶ Therefore , yee shepheards , heare the word of the Lord .
As I liue , saith the Lord God , surely because my flocke became a pray , and my flocke became meate to euery beast of the field , because there was no shepheard , neither did my shepheards search for my flocke , but the shepheards fed themselues , and fed not my flocke :
Therefore , O yee shepheards , heare the word of the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I am against the shepheards , and I will require my flocke at their hand , and cause them to cease from feeding the flocke , neither shall the shepheards feede themselues any more : for I will deliuer my flock from their mouth , that they may not be meat for them .
¶ For thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I , euen I will both search my sheepe , and seeke them out .
As a shepheard seeketh out his flocke in the day that hee is among his sheepe that are scattered : so wil I seeke out my sheep , and will deliuer them out of all places , where they haue bene scattered in the cloudie and darke day .
And I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countreys , and will bring them to their owne land , and feede them vpon the mountaines of Israel by the riuers , and in all the inhabited places of the countrey ,
I will feede them in a good pasture , and vpon the high mountaines of Israel shall their folde be : there shall they lie in a good folde , and in a fat pasture shall they feede vpon the mountaines of Israel .
I will feed my flocke , and I will cause them to lie downe , saith the Lord God .
I will seeke that which was lost , and bring againe that which was driuen away , and will bind vp that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sicke : but I will destroy the fat and the strong , I will feed them with iudgement .
And as for you , O my flocke , thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I iudge betweene cattell and cattell , betweene the rammes and the hee goates .
Seemeth it a small thing vnto you , to haue eaten vp the good pasture , but ye must tread downe with your feet the residue of your pastures ? and to haue drunke of the deepe waters , but yee must fonle the residue with your feete ?
And as for my flocke , they eate that which yee haue troden with your feete : and they drinke that which yee haue fouled with your feete .
¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God vnto them , Behold , I , euen I will iudge betweene the fat cattell , and betweene the leane cattell .
Because yee haue thrust with side and with shoulder , and pusht all the diseased with your hornes , till yee haue scattered them abroad :
Therefore will I saue my flocke , and they shall no more be a pray , and I will iudge betweene cattell and cattell .
And I will set vp one shepheard ouer them , and hee shall feede them , euen my seruant Dauid ; he shall feede them , and hee shall be their shepheard .
And I the Lord will be their God , and my seruant Dauid a prince among them , I the Lord haue spoken it .
And I will make with them a couenant of peace , and will cause the euill beasts to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wildernesse , and sleepe in the woods .
And I will make them and the places round about my hill , a blessing ; and I will cause the showre to come downe in his season : there shall bee showres of blessing .
And the tree of the field shal yeeld her fruite , and the earth shall yeeld her increase , and they shall be safe in their land , and shall know that I am the Lord , when I haue broken the bands of their yoke , and deliuered them out of the hand of those that serued themselues of them .
And they shall no more be a pray to the heathen , neither shall the beasts of the land deuoure them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraide .
And I will raise vp for them a plant of renowne , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither beare the shame of the heathen any more .
Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them , and that they , euen the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord God .

Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto mee , saying ;
Sonne of man , set thy face against mount Seir , and prophecie against it ,
And say vnto it , Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
Because thou hast had a perpetuall hatred , and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamitie , in the time that their iniquitie had an end ;
Therefore , as I liue , saith the Lord God , I will prepare thee vnto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hated blood , euen blood shall pursue thee .
Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate , and cut off from it him that passeth out , & him that returneth .
And I will fill his mountaines with his slaine men : in thy hilles , and in thy valleis , and in all thy riuers shall they fall that are slaine with the sword .
I will make thee perpetuall desolations , & thy cities shall not returne , and ye shal know that I am the Lord
Because thou hast said ; These two nations , and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possesse it , whereas the Lord was there :
Therefore , as I liue , saith the Lord God , I will euen doe according to thine anger , and according to thine enuie , which thou hast vsed out of thy hatred against them : and I will make my selfe knowen amongst them , when I haue iudged thee .
And thou shalt know , that I am the Lord , and that I haue heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountaines of Israel , saying ; They are layed desolate , they are giuen vs to consume .
Thus with your mouth yee haue boasted against me , & haue multiplied your words against me : I haue heard them .
Thus saith the Lord God ; When the whole earth reioyceth , I will make thee desolate .

Also thou sonne of man , prophecie vnto the mountaines of Israel , and say ; Ye mountaines of Israel , Heare the word of the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord God , Because the enemy had said against you , Aha , euen the ancient high places are ours in possession :
Therfore prophecie and say , Thus saith the Lord God , Because they haue made you desolate , and swallowed you vp on euery side , that ye might be a possession vnto the residue of the heathen , and ye are taken vp in the lips of talkers , and are an infamy of the people :
Therefore ye mountaines of Israel , heare the word of the Lord God , Thus saith the Lord God to the mountaines and to the hilles , to the riuers and to the valleys , to the desolate wastes , and to the cities that are forsaken , which became a pray and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about :
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Surely in the fire of my ielousie haue I spoken against the residue of the heathen , and against al Idumea , which haue appointed my land into their possession , with the ioy of all their heart , with despitefull minds to cast it out for a praye .
Prophecie therefore concerning the land of Israel , and say vnto the mountaines and to the hilles , to the riuers and to the valleys , Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I haue spoken in my iealousie and in my furie , because ye haue borne the shame of the heathen ,
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , I haue lifted vp mine hand , Surely the heathen that are about you , they shall beare their shame .
¶ But ye , O mountaines of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yeeld your fruit to my people of Israel , for they are at hand to come .
For behold , I am for you , and I will turne vnto you , and ye shall be tilled and sowen .
And I will multiplie men vpon you , all the house of Israel , euen all of it , and the cities shall be inhabited , and the wastes shall be builded .
And I will multiply vpon you man and beast , and they shall increase and bring fruite , and I will settle you after your olde estates : and will doe better vnto you , then at your beginnings , and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
Yea I will cause men to walke vpon you , euen my people Israel , and they shall possesse thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereaue them of men .
Thus saith the Lord God , Because they say vnto you , Thou land deuourest vp men , and hast bereaued thy nations ,
Therefore thou shalt deuoure men no more , neither bereaue thy nations any more , saith the Lord God .
Neither will I cause men to heare in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou beare the reproch of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause the nations to fall any more , saith the Lord God .
¶ Moreouer the worde of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Sonne of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their owne way , and by their doings : their way was before me as the vncleannesse of a remooued woman .
Wherefore I powred my furie vpon them for the blood that they had shed vpon the land , and for their idoles wherewith they had polluted it .
And I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countreys : according to their way and according to their doings I iudged them .
And when they entred vnto the heathen whither they went , they prophaned my holy Name , when they said to them , These are the people of the Lord , and are gone forth out of his land .
¶ But I had pitie for mine holy Name , which the house of Israel had prophaned among the heathen , whither they went .
Therefore say vnto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God , I doe not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy Names sake , which ye haue prophaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
And I will sanctifie my great Name which was prophaned among the heathen , which ye haue prophaned in the midst of them , and the heathen shall know , that I am the Lord , saith the Lord God , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
For I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countreys , and will bring you into your owne land .
¶ Then will I sprinckle cleane water vpon you , and ye shalbe cleane : from all your filthinesse , and from all your idoles wil I cleanse you .
A new heart also will I giue you , and a new spirit will I put within you , and I will take away the stonie heart out of your flesh , and I will giue you an heart of flesh .
And I wil put my Spirit within you , and cause you to walke in my Statutes , and ye shall keepe my iudgements , and doe them .
And ye shall dwel in the land that I gaue to your fathers , and ye shall be my people , and I wil be your God .
I wil also saue you from all your vncleannesses , and I will call for the corne , and will increase it , and lay no famine vpon you .
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that yee shall receiue no more reproch of famine among the heathen .
Then shall yee remember your owne euil waies , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe your selues in your owne sight for your iniquities , and for your abominations .
Not for your sakes doe I this , saith the Lord God , be it knowen vnto you : be ashamed and confounded for your owne wayes , O house of Israel .
Thus saith the Lord God , In the day that I shall haue cleansed you from all your iniquities , I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shalbe builded .
And the desolate land shalbe tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
And they shall say , This land that was desolate , is become like the garden of Eden , and the waste and desolate and ruined cities , are become fenced , and are inhabited .
Then the heathen that are left round about you , shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the Lord haue spoken it , and I wil doe it .
Thus saith the Lord God , I wil yet for this bee enquired of by the house of Israel , to doe it for them : I will increase them with men like a flocke .

The hand of the Lord was vpon mee , and caried mee out in the Spirit of the Lord , and set mee downe in the middest of the valley which was full of bones ,
And caused mee to passe by them round about , and beholde , there were very many in the open valley , and loe , they were very drie .
And hee said vnto mee , Sonne of man , can these bones liue ? and I answered , O Lord God , thou knowest .
Againe he said vnto me , Prophecie vpon these bones , and say vnto them ; O yee drie bones , heare the word of the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord God vnto these bones , Behold , I wil cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall liue .
And I wil lay sinewes vpon you , and wil bring vp flesh vpon you , and couer you with skinne , and put breath in you , and ye shall liue , and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
So I prophecied as I was commanded : and as I prophecied , there was a noise , and beholde a shaking , and the bones came together , bone to his bone .
And when I beheld , loe , the sinews and the flesh came vp vpon them , and the skin couered them aboue ; but there was no breath in them .
Then said he vnto mee , Prophecie vnto the winde , prophecie sonne of man , and say to the winde , Thus saith the Lord God ; Come from the foure windes , O breath , and breathe vpon these slaine , that they may liue .
So I prophecied as he commanded mee , and the breath came into them , and they liued , and stood vp vpon their feet , an exceeding great armie .
¶ Then he said vnto me , Sonne of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say ; Our bones are dried , and our hope is lost , wee are cut off for our parts .
Therefore prophecie and say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , O my people , I wil open your graues , and cause you to come vp out of your graues , and bring you into the land of Israel .
And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I haue opened your graues , O my people , and brought you vp out of your graues ,
And shall put my spirit in you , and yee shall liue , and I shall place you in your owne land : then shall ye know that I the Lord haue spoken it , and perfourmed it , saith the Lord .
¶ The word of the Lord came againe vnto me , saying ;
Moreouer thou sonne of man , take thee one sticke , and write vpon it , For Iudah and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another sticke , and write vpon it ; For Ioseph the sticke of Ephraim , and for all the house of Israel his companions .
And ioyne them one to another into one sticke , and they shall become one in thine hand .
¶ And when the children of thy people shall speake vnto thee , saying , Wilt thou not shew vs what thou meanest by these ?
Say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I will take the sticke of Ioseph which is in the hand of Ephraim , and the tribes of Israel his fellowes , and will put them with him , euen with the sticke of Iudah , and make them one sticke , and they shall be one in mine hand .
¶ And the stickes whereon thou writest , shalbe in thine hand before their eyes .
And say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen whither they be gone , and will gather them on euery side , and bring them into their owne land .
And I will make them one nation in the land vpon the mountaines of Israel , and one King shall be king to them all : and they shalbe no more two nations , neither shall they bee diuided into two kingdomes any more at all .
Neither shall they defile themselues any more with their idoles , nor with their detestable things , nor with any of their transgressions : but I will saue them out of all their dwelling places , wherein they haue sinned , and will cleanse them : so shall they be my people , and I will be their God .
And Dauid my seruant shall be King ouer them , and they all shall haue one shepheard : they shall also walke in my iudgements , and obserue my statutes , and doe them .
And they shall dwell in the land that I haue giuen vnto Iacob my seruant , wherin your fathers haue dwelt , and they shall dwell therein , euen they and their children , and their childrens children for euer , and my seruant Dauid shalbe their prince for euer .
Moreouer I will make a couenant of peace with them , it shall be an euerlasting couenant wich them , and I will place them and multiply them , and will set my Sanctuary in the middest of them for euermore .
My Tabernacle also shalbe with them : yea , I will be their God , and they shalbe my people .

And I will turne thee backe , and put hookes into thy chawes , and I will bring thee foorth , and all thine armie , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed with all sorts of armour , euen a great company with bucklers & shields , all of them handling swordes .
Persia , Ethiopia and Libya with them ; all of them with shield & helmet :
Gomer and all his bandes , the house of Togarmah of the North quarters , and all his bands , and many people with thee .
Be thou prepared , and prepare for thy selfe , thou and all thy company , that are assembled vnto thee , and be thou a guard vnto them .
¶ After many daies thou shalt be visited : in the latter yeeres thou shalt come into the land , that is brought back from the sword , and is gathered out of many people against the mountaines of Israel , which haue beene alwayes waste : but it is brought forth out of the nations , and they shall dwell safely all of them .
And thou shalt say : I will goe vp to the land of vnwalled villages ; I will goe to them that are at rest , that dwell safely all of them dwelling without walles , and hauing neither barres nor gates ;
To take a spoile , and to take a praye , to turne thine hand vpon the desolate places that are now inhabited , and vpon the people that are gathered out of the nations which haue gotten cattel and goods , that dwell in the middest of the land .
Sheba , and Dedan , and the marchants of Tarshish , with all the young lyons thereof , shall say vnto thee , Art thou come to take a spoile ? hast thou gathered thy company to take a praye ? to carie away siluer and gold , to take away cattell and goods , to take a great spoile ?
¶ Therefore , sonne of man , prophecie and say vnto Gog , Thus saith the Lord God ; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely , shalt thou not know it ?
And thou shalt come from thy place out of the North parts , thou and many people with thee , all of them riding vpon horses , a great company , and a mighty armie .
And thou shalt come vp against my people of Israel , as a cloud to couer the land ; it shall be in the latter dayes , and I will bring thee against my land , that the heathen may know me , when I shall be sanctified in thee , O Gog , before their eyes .
Thus saith the Lord God ; Art thou hee , of whom I haue spoken in old time by my seruants the prophets of Israel , which prophecied in those dayes many yeeres , that I would bring thee against them ?
And it shall come to passe at the same time , when Gog shal come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord God , that my furie shall come vp in my face .
For in my iealousie , and in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken : surely in that day , there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel .
So that the fishes of the sea , and the foules of the heauen , and the beasts of the field , and all creeping things that creepe vpon the earth , and all the men that are vpon the face of the earth , shall shake at my presence , and the mountaines shall be throwen downe , and the steepe places shall fall , and euery wall shall fall to the ground .
And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountaines , saith the Lord God : euery mans sword shalbe against his brother .
And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood , and I will raine vpon him and vpon his bands , and vpon the many people that are with him , an ouerflowing raine , and great hailestones , fire , and brimstone .

And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrowes to fall out of thy right hand .
Thou shalt fall vpon the mountaines of Israel , thou & all thy bands , and the people that is with thee : I will giue thee vnto the rauenous birds of euery sort , and to the beasts of the field to be deuoured .
Thou shalt fall vpon the open field , for I haue spoken it , saith the Lord God .
And I will send a fire on Magog , and among them that dwell carelesly in the yles , and they shall know that I am the Lord .
So will I make my holy Name knowen in the midst of my people Israel , and I will not let them pollute my holy Name any more , and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , the holy One in Israel .
¶ Behold , it is come , and it is done , saith the Lord God , this is the day whereof I haue spoken .
And they that dwell in the cities of Israel , shall goe forth , and shall set on fire , and burne the weapons , both the shields and the bucklers , the bowes and the arrowes , and the handstaues and the speares , and they shall burne them with fire seuen yeeres .
So that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut downe any out of the forrests : for they shall burne the weapons with fire , and they shall spoile those that spoiled them , and rob those that robbed them , saith the Lord God .

And seuen moneths shall the house of Israel bee burying of them , that they may cleanse the land .
Yea all the people of the land shall burie them , and it shall be to them a renowne the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord God .
And they shall seuer out men of continual emploiment , passing through the land , to burie with the passengers those that remaine vpon the face of the earth to clense it : after the end of seuen moneths shall they search .
And the passengers that passe through the lande , when any seeth a mans bone , then shall he set vp a signe by it , till the buriers haue buried it in the valley of Hamon - gog .
And also the name of the citie shall be Hamonah : thus shal they clense the land .

Ye shall eate the flesh of the mightie , and drinke the blood of the princes of the earth , of rammes , of lambes and of goats , of bullocks , all of them fatlings of Bashan .
And yee shall eate fat till yee be full , and drinke blood till yee be drunken , of my sacrifice which I haue sacrificed for you .
Thus yee shall be filled at my table with horses and charets , with mightie men , and with all men of warre , saith the Lord God .
And I will set my glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shal see my iudgement that I haue executed , and my hande that I haue laid vpon them .
So the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward .
¶ And the heathen shall knowe that the house of Israel went into captiuitie for their iniquitie : because they trespassed against me , therefore hid I my face from them , and gaue them into the hand of their enemies ; so fell they all by the sword .
According to their vncleannesse , and according to their transgressions haue I done vnto them , and hid my face from them .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Now will I bring againe the captiuitie of Iacob , and haue mercie vpon the whole house of Israel , and will be ielous for my holy Name :
After that they haue borne their shame , and all their trespasses , wherby they haue trespassed against me , when they dwelt safely in their lande , and none made them afraid .
When I haue brought them againe from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ;
Then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which caused them to be led into captiuitie among the heathen : but I haue gathered them vnto their owne land , and haue left none of them any more there .

And he brought mee thither , and behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brasse , with a line of flaxe in his hand , & a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
And the man saide vnto mee ; Sonne of man , behold with thine eyes , and heare with thine eares , & set thine heart vpon all that I shall shew thee : for to the intent that I might shew them vnto thee , art thou brought hither : declare all that thou seest , to the house of Israel .
And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about : and in the mans hand a measuring reed of sixe cubites long , by the cubite , and an hand breadth : so hee measured the breadth of the building , one reed , and the height one reed .
He measured also the porch of the gate within , one reed .
Then measured hee the porch of the gate , eight cubites , and the postes thereof two cubits , and the porch of the gate was inward .
And the litle chambers of the gate Eastward , were three on this side , and three on that side , they three were of one measure , and the postes had one measure on this side , and on that side .
And hee measured the breadth of the entrie of the gate , ten cubits , and the length of the gate , thirteene cubites .
The space also before the litle chambers was one cubite on this side , and the space was one cubite on that side , and the litle chambers were sixe cubites on this side , and sixe cubits on that side .
Hee measured then the gate from the roofe of the one litle chamber to the roofe of another : the breadth was fiue and twentie cubits , doore against doore .
He made also postes of threescore cubites , euen vnto the poste of the court round about the gate .
And from the face of the gate of the entrance , vnto the face of the porch of the inner gate , were fiftie cubites .
And there were narrow windows to the litle chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the arches : and windowes were round about inward : and vpon ech post were palme - trees .
Then brought he me into the outward court , and loe there were chambers , and a pauement , made for the court round about : thirtie chambers were vpon the pauement .
¶ And the gate of the outward court , that looked toward the North , he measured the length thereof , and the breadth thereof .
And the little chambers thereof were three on this side , and three on that side , and the postes thereof , and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate : the length thereof was fiftie cubites , and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites .
And their windowes , and their arches , and their palme trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh towards the East , and they went vp vnto it by seuen steps , and the arches thereof were before them .
And the gate of the inner court was ouer against the gate toward the North and toward the East , and hee measured from gate to gate an hundreth cubites .
¶ After that hee brought me toward the South , and behold a gate toward the South , and he measured the postes thereof , and the arches thereof according to these measures .
And there were windowes in it , and in the arches thereof round about , like those windowes , the length was fiftie cubites , and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites .
And there were seuen steps to goe vp to it , and the arches thereof were before them , and it had palme trees , one on this side , and another on that side vpon the postes thereof . And there was a gate in the inner court toward the South , and he measured from gate to gate toward the South an hundred cubites .
And hee brought me to the inner court by the South gate , and he measured the South gate according to these measures ,
And the little chambers thereof , and the postes thereof , and the arches thereof according to these measures , and there were windowes in it , and in the arches thereof round about : it was fiftie cubites long , and fiue and twentie cubites broad .
And the arches round about were fiue and twenty cubits long , and fiue cubites broad .
And the arches thereof were toward the vtter court , and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof , and the going vp to it had eight steps .
¶ And hee brought me into the inner court toward the East , and hee measured the gate according to these measures .
And the little chambers thereof , and the postes thereof , and the arches thereof were according to these measures , and there were windowes therein , and in the arches thereof round about , it was fiftie cubites long , and fiue and twentie cubits broad .
And the arches thereof were toward the outward court , and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof on this side , and on that side , and the going vp to it had eight steps .
¶ And hee brought me to the North gate , and measured it according to these measures .
The little chambers thereof , the postes thereof , and the arches thereof and the windowes to it round about : the length was fiftie cubites , and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites .
And the postes thereof were toward the vtter court , and palme trees were vpon the posts thereof on this side , and on that side , and the going vp to it had eight steps .
And the chambers , and the entries thereof were by the postes of the gates , where they washed the burnt offering .
¶ And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt offering , and the sinne offering , and the trespasse offering .
And at the side without , as one goeth vp to the entry of the North gate , were two tables , and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
Foure tables were on this side , and foure tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew their sacrifices .
And the foure tables were of hewen stone for the burnt offering , of a cubite and an halfe long , and a cubite & a halfe broad , and one cubit high : whereupon also they laide the instruments wherewith they slewe the burnt offering and the sacrifice .
And within were hooks , an hand broad , fastened round about , and vpon the tables was the flesh of the offering .
¶ And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the North gate : and their prospect was toward the South , one at the side of the East gate , hauing the prospect toward the North .
And hee said vnto me ; This chamber whose prospect is toward the South , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North , is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sonnes of Zadok among the sonnes of Leui , which come neere to the Lord to minister vnto him .
Afterward he brought me to the Temple , and measured the posts , six cubites broad on the one side , and sixe cubites broad on the other side , which was the bredth of the Tabernacle . And the bredth of the doore was tenne cubites , and the sides of the doore were fiue cubites on the one side , and fiue cubites on the other side , and he measured the length thereof fortie cubites , and the bredth twentie cubites .
Then went he inward , and measured the post of the doore two cubites , and the doore sixe cubites , and the bredth of the doore seuen cubites .
So he measured the length therof twentie cubites , and the bredth twentie cubites before the temple , and he said vnto me ; This is the most holy place .
I saw also the height of the house round about ; the foundations of the side - chambers were a full reede of sixe great cubites . The thicknesse of the wall which was for the side chamber without , was fiue cubites , and that which was left , was the place of the side - chambers that were within .
And betweene the chambers was the widenesse of twentie cubites round about the house on euery side .
And the doores of the side - chambers were toward the place that was left , one doore toward the North , and an other doore toward the South , and the bredth of the place that was left , was fiue cubites round about .
Now the building that was before the seperate place , at the end toward the West , was seuenty cubites broad , and the wall of the building was fiue cubites thicke round about , and the length thereof ninety cubites .
So he measured the house , an hundreth cubites long , and the separate place and the building with the walles thereof , an hundreth cubites long .
Also the bredth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the East , an hundreth cubites .
And he measured the length of the building ouer against the separate place which was behind it , and the galleries thereof on the one side , and on the other side an hundreth cubites with the inner temple , and the porches of the court .
The doore - posts and the narrow windows , and the galleries round about on their three stories , ouer against the doore sieled with wood round about , and from the ground vp to the windows , & the windows were couered .
To that aboue the doore , euen vnto the inner house and without , and by all the wall round about within and without by measure . And it was made with Cherubims and Palme trees , so that a Palme tree was betweene a Cherub and a Cherub , and euery Cherub had two faces .
So that the face of a man was toward the Palme - tree on the one side , and the face of a yong lyon toward the Palme - tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
From the ground vnto aboue the doore were Cherubims and Palme - trees made , & on the wall of the temple .
The postes of the Temple were squared , and the face of the Sanctuary , the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
The altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the walles thereof were of wood : and hee said vnto mee ; This is the Table that is before the Lord .
And the Temple and the Sanctuarie had two doores .
And the doores had two leaues a piece , two turning leaues , two leaues for the one doore , and two leaues for the other doore .
And there were made on them , on the doores of the Temple , Cherubims and Palme - trees , like as were made vpon the walles , and there were thicke planckes vpon the face of the porch without .
<NON-VERSE>
Then he brought me foorth into the vtter court , the way toward the North , and hee brought mee into the chamber , that was ouer against the separate place , & which was before the building toward the North .
Before the length of an hundreth cubites was the North doore , and the breadth was fiftie cubits .
Ouer against the twentie cubites which were for the inner court , and ouer against the pauement which was for the vtter court , was gallerie against gallery in three stories .
And before the chambers was a walke of ten cubites breadth inward , a way of one cubite , and their doores toward the North .
Now the vpper - chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher then these , then the lower , and then the middlemost of the building .
For the length of the chambers that were in the vtter court was fiftie cubites : and loe , before the Temple were an hundreth cubites .
And from vnder these chambers was the entrie on the East side , as one goeth into them from the vtter court .
The chambers were in the thickenes of the wall of the court toward the East , ouer against the separate place , and ouer against the building .
And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers , which were toward the North , as long as they and as broad as they , and all their goings out were both according to their fashions , and according to their doores .
And according to the doores of the chambers that were toward the South , was a doore in the head of the way , euen the way directly before ye wall toward the East , as one entreth into them .
¶ Then sayd hee vnto mee , The North chambers , and the South chambers , which are before the separate place , they be holy chambers , where the Priests that approach vnto the Lord shall eate the most holy things : there shall they lay the most holy things , and the meat offering , & the sinne offering , and the trespasse offring , for the place is holy .
When the Priests enter therein , then shall they not goe out of the holy place into the vtter court , but there they shall lay their garments , wherein they minister : for they are holy , and shall put on other garments , and shall approch to those things which are for the people .
Now when hee had made an end of measuring the inner house , hee brought mee foorth toward the gate , whose prospect is toward the East , and measured it round about . He measured the East side with the measuring reede , fiue hundreth reedes , with the measuring reed round about .
Hee measured the North side fiue hundreth reedes , with a measuring reed round about . Hee measured the South side fiue hundreth reedes , with the measuring reede .
¶ Hee turned about to the West side , and measured fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reed .
<NON-VERSE>
Afterward he brought me to the gate , euen the gate that looketh toward the East .
And behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the East : and his voice was like a noise of many waters , and the earth shined with his glory .
And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , euen according to the vision that I saw , when I came to destroy the citie : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the riuer Chebar : and I fell vpon my face .
And the glorie of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate , whose prospect is toward the East .
So the Spirit tooke me vp , and brought mee into the inner court , and behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house .
And I heard him speaking vnto me out of the house , & the man stood by me .
¶ And he said vnto me , Sonne of man , the place of my throne , and the place of the soles of my feete , where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for euer , and my holy Name , shall the house of Israel no more defile , neither they , nor their kings , by their whoredome , nor by the carkeises of their kings in their high places .
In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds , and their post by my postes , and the wall betweene me and them , they haue euen defiled my holy Name by their abominations that they haue committed : wherefore I haue consumed them in mine anger .
Now let them put away their whoredome , and the carkeises of their kings farre from me , and I wil dwell in the middest of them for euer .
¶ Thou sonne of man , shew the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities , and let them measure the patterne .
And if they be ashamed of all that they haue done ; shew them the forme of the house , and the fashion thereof , and the goings out thereof , and the commings in thereof , and all the formes thereof , and all the ordinances thereof , and all the formes thereof , and all the lawes thereof : & write it in their sight , that they may keepe the whole forme thereof , and all the Ordinances therof , and doe them .
This is the law of the house ; Upon the top of the mountaine , the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy : behold , this is the law of the house .
¶ And these are the measures of the Altar after the cubites ; the cubite is a cubite and an hand breadth , euen the bottom shalbe a cubite , and the breadth a cubite , and the border thereof by the edge therof round about shalbe a spanne , and this shalbe the higher place of the Altar .
And from the bottom vpon the ground , euen to the lower settle , shalbe two cubits , and the breadth one cubite , and from the lesser settle euen to the greater settle shalbe foure cubites , and the breadth one cubite .
So the Altar shalbe foure cubites , and from the altar and vpward shalbe foure hornes .
And the altar shalbe twelue cubites long , twelue broad , square in the foure squares thereof .
And the settle shall bee fourteene cubites long , and fourteene broad in the foure squares thereof , and the border about it shalbe halfe a cubite , and the bottome thereof shall be a cubite about , and his staires shall looke toward the East .
¶ And he said vnto me , Sonne of man , thus saith the Lord God , These are the ordinances of the Altar in the day when they shall make it to offer burnt offrings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
And thou shalt giue to the Priests the Leuites that be of the seede of Zadok , which approch vnto me , to minister vnto me , saith the Lord God , a yong bullocke for a sinne offering .
And thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the foure hornes of it , and on the foure corners of the settle , and vpon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
Thou shalt take the bullocke also of the sinne offering , and he shall burne it in the appointed place of the house without the Sanctuary .
And on the second day thou shalt offer a kidde of the goats without blemish for a sinne offering , and they shall cleanse the Altar , as they did cleanse it with the bullocke .
When thou hast made an ende of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a yong bullocke without blemish , and a ramme out of the flocke , without blemish .
And thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the Priests shall cast salt vpon them , and they shall offer them vp for a burnt offering vnto the Lord .
Seuen dayes shalt thou prepare euery day a goate for a sinne offering : they shall also prepare a yong bullocke , and a ramme out of the flocke , without blemish .
Seuen dayes shal they purge the Altar and purifie it , and they shall consecrate themselues .
<NON-VERSE>
Then he brought me backe the way of the gate of the outward Sanctuarie which looketh toward the East , and it was shut .
Then said the Lord vnto me , This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the Lord the God of Israel hath entred in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
It is for the Prince ; the Prince , hee shall sit in it to eate bread before the Lord : hee shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall goe out by the way of the same .
¶ Then brought he me the way of the North gate before the house , and I looked , and behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord , and I fell vpon my face .
And the Lord said vnto me ; Sonne of man , marke well , and behold with thine eyes , and heare with thine eares , all that I say vnto thee , concerning all the ordinances of the house of ehe Lord , and all the lawes thereof , and marke well the entring in of the house , with euery going foorth of the Sanctuary .
And thou shalt say to the rebellious , euen to the house of Israel , Thus sayth the Lord God ; O yee house of Israel , let it suffice you , of all your abominations ;
In that ye haue brought into my Sanctuarie strangers vncircumcised in heart , and vncircumcised in flesh , to be in my Sanctuarie to pollute it , euen my House , when ye offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they haue broken my Couenant , because of all your abominations .
And yee haue not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye haue set keepers of my charge in my Sanctuarie for your selues .
¶ Thus sayth the Lord God , No stranger vncircumcised in heart , nor vncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my Sanctuarie , of any stranger that is among the children of Israel .
And the Leuites that are gone away farre from me , when Israel went astray , which went astray away from me after their idoles , they shall euen beare their iniquitie .
Yet they shall be ministers in my Sanctuary , hauing charge at the gates of the house , and ministring to the house : they shall slay the burnt offring , and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister vnto them :
Because they ministred vnto them before their idoles , and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquitie ; therefore haue I lift vp mine hand against them , saith the Lord God , and they shall beare their iniquitie .
And they shall not come neere vnto me to doe the office of a priest vnto me , nor to come neere to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall beare their shame , and their abominations which they haue committed .
But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the seruice thereof , and for all that shalbe done therein .
¶ But the priests the Leuites , the sonnes of Zadok , that kept the charge of my sanctuarie , when the children of Israel went astray from me , they shall come neere to me to minister vnto me , and they shall stand before me to offer vnto me the fat and the blood , saith the Lord God .
They shall enter into my sanctuarie , and they shall come neere to my table to minister vnto mee , and they shall keepe my charge .
¶ And it shall come to passe that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linnen garments , and no wooll shall come vpon them , whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court and within .
They shall haue linnen bonets vpon their heads , and shall haue linnen breeches vpon their loynes : they shall not girde themselues with any thing that causeth sweat .
And when they goe forth into the vtter court , euen into the vtter court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministred , and lay them in the holy chambers , and they shall put on other garments , and they shall not sanctifie the people with their garments .
Neither shall they shaue their heads , nor suffer their lockes to grow long , they shall only polle their heads .
Neither shall any priest drinke wine , when they enter into the inner court .
Neither shall they take for their wiues a widow , or her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seede of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
And they shall teach my people the difference betweene the holy and prophane , and cause men to discerne betweene the vncleane and the cleane .
And in controuersie they shall stand in iudgement , and they shall iudge it according to my iudgements : and they shall keepe my lawes and my statutes in all mine assemblies , and they shall halow my Sabbaths .
And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselues : but for father or for mother , or for sonne or for daughter , for brother or for sister , that hath had no husband , they may defile themselues .
And after he is cleansed , they shal reckon vnto him seuen dayes .
And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuarie , vnto the inner court to minister in the sanctuarie , he shall offer his sinne offring , saith the Lord God .
And it shall be vnto them for an inheritance ; I am their inheritance : and yee shall giue them no possession in Israel ; I am their possession .
They shal eate the meate offring , and the sinne offring , and the trespasse offring , and euery dedicate thing in Israel shall be theirs .
And the first of all the first fruits of all things , and euery oblation of all of euery sort of your oblations shall be the priests : yee shall also giue vnto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer , when yee shall diuide by lot the land for inheritance , yee shall offer an oblation vnto the Lord , an holy portion of the land : the length shall be the length of fiue and twentie thousand reedes , and the bredth shalbe ten thousand : this shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about . Of this there shal be for the Sanctuarie fiue hundreth in length , with fiue hundreth in bredth , square round about , and fiftie cubites round about , for the suburbs thereof .
And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of fiue and twentie thousand , and the bredth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the Sanctuarie and the most holy place .
The holy portion of the land shal bee for the priests the ministers of the Sanctuarie , which shall come neere to minister vnto the Lord , and it shall be a place for their houses , and an holy place for the Sanctuarie .
And the fiue and twenty thousand of length , and the tenne thousand of breadth , shall also the Leuites the ministers of the house haue for themselues , for a possession for twentie chambers .
¶ And ye shall appoint the possession of the citie fiue thousand broad , and fiue and twentie thousand long ouer against the oblation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
¶ And a portion shalbe for the prince on the one side , and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion , and of the possession of the citie , before the oblation of the holy portion , and before the possession of the citie from the West side Westward , and from the East side Eastward , and the length shalbe ouer against one of the portions from the West border vnto the East border .
In the land shall be his possession in Israel , and my princes shall no more oppresse my people , and the rest of the land shall they giue to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God , Let it suffice you , O princes of Israel : remoue violence and spoile , and execute iudgement and iustice , take away your exactions from my people , saith the Lord God .
Ye shall haue iust ballances , and a iust Ephah , and a iust Bath .
The Ephah and the Bath shal be of one measure , that the Bath may containe the tenth part of an Homer , and the Ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
And the shekell shall be twentie Gerahs : twenty shekels , fiue and twentie shekels , fifteene shekels shall be your Maneh .
This is the oblation that ye shal offer , the sixt part of an Ephah of an Homer of wheat , & ye shal giue the sixt part of an Ephah of an Homer of barley .
Concerning the ordinance of oile , the Bath of oyle , ye shall offer the tenth part of a Bath out of the Cor , which is an Homer of ten Baths , for ten Baths are an Homer .
And one lambe out of the flocke , out of two hundred , out of the fat pastures of Israel for a meate offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings to make reconciliation for them , saith the Lord God .
All the people of the land shall giue this oblation for the prince in Israel .
And it shall be the princes part to giue burnt offerings , and meat offrings , and drinke offerings , in the feasts , and in the new moones , and in the Sabbaths , in all solemnities of the house of Israel : he shall prepare the sinne offering , and the meate offering , and the burnt offering , and the peace offrings , to make reconciliation for the house of Israel .
Thus saith the Lord God , In the first moneth , in the first day of the moneth , thou shalt take a yong bullock without blemish , and clense the Sanctuarie .
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offering , and put it vpon the postes of the house , and vpon the foure corners of the settle of the Altar , and vpon the postes of the gate of the inner court .
And so thou shalt doe the seuenth day of the moneth , for euery one that erreth , and for him that is simple : so shall ye reconcile the house .
In the first moneth , in the fourteenth day of the moneth , ye shall haue the passeouer a feast of seuen dayes , vnleauened bread shall be eaten .
And vpon that day shall the prince prepare for himselfe , and for all the people of the land , a bullocke for a sinne offering .
And seuen dayes of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seuen bullockes , and seuen rammes without blemish dayly the seuen dayes , and a kidde of the goats daily for a sinne offering .
And hee shall prepare a meat offering of an Ephah for a bullocke , and an Ephah for a ramme , and an Hin of oyle for an Ephah .
<NON-VERSE>
Thus saith the Lord God , The gate of the inner court , that looketh toward the East , shalbe shut the sixe working dayes : but on the Sabbath it shall be opened , and in the day of the New moone it shalbe opened .
And the Prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without , and shall stand by the post of the gate , and the Priests shall prepare his burnt offering , and his peace offerings , and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate : then he shall goe foorth , but the gate shall not be shut vntil the euening .
Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the doore of this gate before the Lord , in the Sabbaths , and in the New moones .
And the burnt offering that the Prince shall offer vnto the Lord in the Sabbath day , shall be sixe lambes without blemish , and a ramme without blemish .
And the meat offring shalbe an Ephah for a ramme , and the meate offering for the lambes as he shalbe able to giue , and an Hin of oile to an Ephah .
And in the day of the New moone it shall be a yong bullocke without blemish , and sixe lambes , and a ramme : they shalbe without blemish .
And hee shall prepare a meat offering , an Ephah for a bullocke , and an Ephah for a ramme , and for the lambs , according as his hand shall attaine vnto , and an Hin of oile to an Ephah .
And when the Prince shall enter , he shall goe in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall goe foorth by the way thereof .
¶ But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord , in the solemne feasts , he that entreth in by the way of the North gate to worship , shall goe out by the way of the South gate : and he that entreth by the way of the South gate , shall goe forth by the way of the North gate : he shall not returne by the way of the gate whereby he came in , but shall goe foorth ouer against it .
And the Prince in the midst of them when they goe in , shal goe in , and when they goe foorth , shall goe forth .
And in the feasts , and in the solemnities , the meat offering shalbe an Ephah to a bullocke , and an Ephah to a ramme , and to the lambes , as he is able to giue , and an Hin of oile to an Ephah .
Now when the Prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings , voluntarily vnto the Lord , one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the East , and he shall prepare his burnt offering , and his peace offerings , as hee did on the Sabbath day , then he shall goe foorth , and after his going foorth , one shall shut the gate .
Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering vnto the Lord , of a lambe of the first yeere , without blemish thou shalt prepare it euery morning .
And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it euery morning ; the sixt part of an Ephah , and the third part of an Hin of oyle , to temper with the fine flowre ; a meat offering continually , by a perpetual ordinance vnto the Lord .
Thus shall they prepare the lambe , and the meat offering , and the oyle , euery morning , for a continuall burnt offering .
¶ Thus saith the Lord God , If the prince giue a gift vnto any of his sonnes , the inheritance thereof shall be his sonnes , it shall be their possession by inheritance :
But if hee giue a gift of his inheritance to one of his seruants , then it shalbe his to the yeere of libertie : after , it shall returne to the Prince , but his inheritance shalbe his sonnes for them .
Moreouer , the Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppression , to thrust them out of their possession : but hee shall giue his sonnes inheritance out of his owne possession , that my people be not scattered euery man from his possession .
¶ After , he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the Priests which looked toward the North : and behold , there was a place on the two sides Westward .
In the foure corners of the court there were courts ioyned of fourtie cubits long , and thirtie broad : these foure corners were of one measure .
And there was a new building round about in them , round about them foure and it was made with boyling places vnder the rowes round about .
<NON-VERSE>
Afterward hee brought me againe vnto the doore of the house , and behold , waters issued out from vnder the threshold of the house Eastward : for the forefront of the house stood toward the East , and the waters came downe from vnder from the right side of the house , at the South side of the Altar .
Then brought hee me out of the way of the gate Northward , and ledde me about the way without vnto the vtter gate by the way that looketh Eastward , and behold , there ranne out waters on the right side .
And when the man that had the line in his hand , went forth Eastward , he measured a thousand cubites , and he brought me through the waters : the waters were to the ancles .
Againe he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees : againe he measured a thousand , and brought mee through ; the waters were to the loynes .
Afterward hee measured a thousand , and it was a riuer , that I could not passe ouer : for the waters were risen , waters to swimme in , a riuer that could not be passed ouer .
¶ And hee said vnto me , Sonne of man , hast thou seene this ? Then hee brought me , and caused me to returne to the brinke of the riuer .
Now when I had returned , behold , at the banke of the riuer were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
Then said he vnto me , These waters issue out toward the East country , and go downe into the desert , and goe into the sea : which being brought foorth into the sea , the waters shalbe healed .
And it shall come to passe , that euery thing that liueth , which mooueth , whithersoeuer the riuers shall come , shall liue , and there shall be a very great multitude of fish , because these waters shall come thither : for they shall be healed , and euery thing shall liue whither the riuer commeth .
And it shall come to passe that the fishers shall stand vpon it , from Engedi euen vnto En - eglaim ; they shall be a place to spread foorth nets , their fish shall bee according to their kindes , as the fish of the great Sea , exceeding many .
But the myrie places thereof , and the marishes thereof , shall not be healed , they shall be giuen to salt .
And by the riuer vpon the banke thereof on this side , and on that side , shall grow all trees for meat , whose leafe shal not fade , neither shal the fruit thereof be consumed : it shall bring forth new fruit , according to his moneths , because their waters they issued out of the Sanctuarie , and the fruite thereof shall be for meate , and the leafe thereof for medicine .
¶ Thus sayth the Lord God , This shall be the border , whereby yee shall inherite the land , according to the twelue tribes of Israel : Ioseph shall haue two portions .
And yee shall inherite it , one as well as an other : concerning the which I lifted vp mine hand to giue it vnto your fathers , and this land shal fall vnto you for inheritance .
And this shall be the border of the land toward the North side from the great Sea , the way of Hethlon , as men goe to Zedad :
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is betweene the border of Damascus , and the border of Hamath : Hazar Hatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
And the border from the Sea shall be Hazar - enan , the border of Damascus , and the North northward , and the border of Hamath : and this is the North side .
And the East side yee shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by Iordan , from the border vnto the East sea : & this is the East side .
And the South side Southward from Tamar , euen to the waters of strife in Kadesh , the riuer , to the great Sea ; and this is the South side Southward .
¶ And it shall come to passe , that yee shall diuide it by lot for an inheritance vnto you , and to the strangers that soiourne among you , which shall beget children among you , and they shall be vnto you as borne in the countrey among the children of Israel ; they shall haue inheritance with you among the Tribes of Israel .

Now in the first yeere of Cyrus King of Persia , ( that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Ieremiah , might be fulfilled ) the Lord stirred vp the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdome , and put it also in writing , saying ;
Thus sayth Cyrus king of Persia , The Lord God of heauen hath giuen mee all the kingdomes of the earth , and he hath charged me to build him an house at Ierusalem , which is in Iudah .
Who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him goe vp to Ierusalem , which is in Iudah , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel ( He is the God ) which is in Ierusalem .
And whosoeuer remaineth in any place where hee soiourneth , let the men of his place helpe him with siluer , and with golde , and with goods , and with beasts , besides the free - will offering for the house of God that is in Ierusalem .
¶ Then rose vp the chiefe of the fathers of Iudah and Beniamin , and the Priests , and the Leuites , with all them whose spirit God had raised to goe vp , to build the house of the Lord which is in Ierusalem .
And all they that were about them , strengthened their hands with vessels of siluer , with golde , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things ; besides all that was willingly offered .
¶ Also Cyrus the king brought foorth the vessels of the house of the Lord , which Nebuchadnezzar had brought foorth out of Ierusalem , and had put them in the house of his gods :
Euen those did Cyrus king of Persia bring foorth , by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbred them vnto Sheshbazzar the Prince of Iudah .
And this is the number of them : thirtie chargers of golde , a thousand chargers of siluer , nine and twentie kniues :

And when the seuenth moneth was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities : the people gathered themselues together , as one man to Ierusalem .
Then stood vp Ieshua the sonne of Iozadak , & his brethren the priests , and Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel , and his brethren , and builded the Altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offrings thereon , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
And they set the altar vpon his bases , ( for feare was vpon them , because of the people of those countreys ) and they offered burnt offerings thereon vnto the Lord , euen burnt offerings , morning and euening .
They kept also the feast of tabernacles , as it is written , and offred the dayly burnt offrings , by number , according to the custome , as the duetie of euery day required :
And afterward offered the continuall burnt offering , both of the new moones , and of all the set feasts of the Lord , that were consecrated , and of euery one that willingly offred , offered a free will offering vnto the Lord .
From the first day of the seuenth moneth , began they to offer burnt offerings vnto the Lord : but the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid .
They gaue money also vnto the masons , and to the carpenters , and meate , and drinke , and oyle , vnto them of Zidon , and to them of Tyre , to bring Cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Ioppa : according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia .
¶ Now in the second yere of their coming vnto the house of God at Ierusalem , in the second moneth , began Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel , and Ieshua the sonne of Iozadak , and the remnant of their brethren , the Priests and the Leuites , and all they that were come out of the captiuitie vnto Ierusalem : and appointed the Leuites , from twentie yeeres olde and vpward , to set forward the worke of the house of the Lord .
Then stood Ieshua , with his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sonnes , the sonnes of Iudah together , to set forward the workemen in the house of God : the sonnes of Henadad , with their sonnes and their brethren the Leuites .
And when the builders laide the foundation of the Temple of the Lord , they set the Priests in their apparell with Trumpets , and the Leuites the sonnes of Asaph , with Cymbales , to praise the Lord , after the ordinance of Dauid king of Israel .

Now when the aduersaries of Iudah and Beniamin , heard that the children of the captiuitie builded the Temple vnto the Lord God of Israel :
Then they came to Zerubbabel , and to the chiefe of the fathers , and said vnto them , Let vs build with you , for wee seeke your God , as yee doe , and we doe sacrifice vnto him , since the dayes of Esar - Haddon king of Assur , which brought vs vp hither .
But Zerubbabel and Ieshua , and the rest of the chiefe of the fathers of Israel , said vnto them , You haue nothing to doe with vs , to build an house vnto our God , but we our selues together will build vnto the Lord God of Israel , as king Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded vs . Then the people of the land weakened the handes of the people of Iudah , and troubled them in building ,
And hired counsellers against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the dayes of Cyrus king of Persia , euen vntill the reigne of Darius king of Persia .
And in the reigne of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reigne , wrote they vnto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Iudah and Ierusalem .
¶ And in the dayes of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of their companions , vnto Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue , and interpreted in the Syrian tongue .
Rehum the Chancellour , and Shimshai the Scribe , wrote a letter against Ierusalem , to Artaxerxes the king , in this sort :
Then , wrote Rehum the Chancellour , and Shimshai the Scribe , and the rest of their companions ; the Dinaites , the Apharsathkites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archeuites , the Babylonians , the Susanchites , the Dehauites , and the Elamites ,
And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought ouer , and set in the cities of Samaria , and the rest that are on this side the Riuer , and at such a time .
¶ This is the copy of the Letter , that they sent vnto him , euen vnto Artaxerxes the king : Thy seruants on this side the Riuer , and at such a time ,
Be it knowen vnto the king , that the Iewes which came vp from thee to vs , are come vnto Ierusalem , building the rebellious and the bad citie , and haue set vp the walles thereof , and ioyned the foundations .
Be it knowen now vnto the king , that if this city be builded , and the wals set vp againe , then will they not pay tolle , tribute , and custome , and so thou shalt endammage the reuenue of the kings .
Now because we haue maintenance from the Kings palace , and it was not meete for vs to see the kings dishonour : therefore haue we sent , and certified the king ,
That search may be made in the booke of the Records of thy fathers : so shalt thou finde in the booke of the Records , and know , that this City is a rebellious city , and hurtfull vnto Kings and prouinces , and that they haue moued sedition within the same of olde time : for which cause was this citie destroyed .
We certifie the king , that if this citie be builded againe , & the walles thereof set vp : by this meanes , thou shalt haue no portion on this side the Riuer .
¶ Then sent the king an answere vnto Rehum the Chancellour , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions , that dwell in Samaria , and vnto the rest beyond the Riuer , Peace , and at such a time .
The letter , which ye sent vnto vs , hath bene plainly read before me .
And I commaunded , and search hath bene made , and it is found , that this citie of old time hath made insurrection against Kings , and that rebellion & sedition haue bene made therein .
There haue bene mighty Kings also ouer Ierusalem , which haue ruled ouer all countreys beyond the Riuer , and tolle , tribute , and custome , was payd vnto them .
Giue ye now commandement , to cause these men to cease , and that this citie be not builded , vntill another commandement shall be giuen from me .
Take heed now that ye faile not to doe this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
¶ Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went vp in haste to Ierusalem , vnto the Iewes , and made them to cease , by force and power .
<NON-VERSE>
Then the Prophets , Haggai the Prophet , and Zechariah the sonne of Iddo , prophesied vnto the Iewes that were in Iudah and Ierusalem , in the Name of the God of Israel , euen vnto them .
Then rose vp Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel , and Ieshua the sonne of Iozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Ierusalem : and with them were the Prophets of God helping them .
¶ At the same time came to them Tatnai , gouernour on this side the Riuer , and Shethar - Boznai , and their companions , and said thus vnto them ; Who hath commaunded you to build this house , and to make vp this wall ?
Then said wee vnto them after this maner , What are the names of the men that make this building ?
But the eye of their God was vpon the Elders of the Iewes , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answere by letter concerning this matter .
¶ The copy of the letter that Tatnai , gouernour on this side the Riuer , and Shethar - Boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the Riuer , sent vnto Darius the King :
They sent a letter vnto him , wherein was written thus : Unto Darius the king , all peace .
Be it knowen vnto the king , that we went into the prouince of Iudea , to the house of the great God , which is builded with great stones , & timber is laied in the wals , and this worke goeth fast on , and prospereth in their hands .
Then asked we those Elders , and said vnto them thus , Who commanded you to build this house , and to make vp these walles ?
We asked their names also , to certifie thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chiefe of them .
And thus they returned vs answere , saying , We are the seruants of the God of heauen and earth , and build the house that was builded these many yeeres agoe , which a great King of Israel builded , and set vp .
But after that our fathers had prouoked the God of heauen vnto wrath : he gaue them into the hande of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Caldean , who destroyed this house , and caried the people away into Babylon .
But in the first yere of Cyrus the king of Babylon , the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
And the vessels also of golde and siluer of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar tooke out of the Temple that was in Ierusalem , and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were deliuered vnto one , whose name was Sheshbazzar , whome he had made gouernour :
And said vnto him , Take these vessels , goe , carie them into the temple that is in Ierusalem , and let the house of God be builded in his place .
Then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God , which is in Ierusalem . And since that time , euen vntill now , hath it bin in building , & yet it is not finished .

Then Darius the King made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rolles , where the treasures were laide vp in Babylon .
And there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the prouince of the Medes , a rolle , and therein was a record thus written :
In the first yeere of Cyrus the king , the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Ierusalem : Let the house be builded , the place where they offered sacrifices , and let the foundations thereof of be strongly laid , the height therof threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof threescore cubites :
With three rowes of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expences bee giuen out of the kings house .
And also let the golden , and siluer vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar tooke foorth out of the temple which is at Ierusalem , and brought vnto Babylon , be restored , and brought againe vnto the temple which is at Ierusalem , euery one to his place , and place them in the house of God .
Now therefore Tatnai , gouernour beyond the riuer , Shethar - Boznai , and your companions the Apharsachites , which are beyond the riuer , be ye farre from thence :
Let the worke of this house of God alone , let the gouernour of the Iewes , and the elders of the Iewes , build this house of God in his place .
Moreouer I make a decree , what ye shall doe to the Elders of these Iewes , for the building of this house of God : that of the kings goods , euen of the tribute beyond the riuer , forthwith expences be giuen vnto these men , that they be not hindered .
And that which they haue need of , both yong bullocks , and rammes , and lambes , for the burnt offerings of the God of heauen , wheat , salt , wine , and oyle , according to the appoyment of the priests which are at Ierusalem , let it be giuen them , day by day without faile :
That they may offer sacrifices of sweet sauours vnto the God of heauen , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sonnes .
Also I haue made a decree , that whosoeuer shall alter this word , let timber be pulled down from his house , and being set vp , let him bee hanged thereon , and let his house bee made a doung hill for this .
And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there , destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand , to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Ierusalem . I Darius haue made a decree , let it be done with speed .
¶ Then Tatnai gouernour on this side the riuer , Shethar - Boznai , & their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
And the elders of the Iewes builded , and they prospered , through the prophecying of Haggai the Prophet , and Zechariah the sonne of Iddo , and they builded , and finished it , according to the commandement of the God of Israel , and according to the commandement of Cyrus and Darius , and Artaxerxes king of Persia .
And this honse was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixt yere of the reigne of Darius the king .
¶ And the children of Israel , the Priests and the Leuites , and the rest of the children of the captiuitie , kept the dedication of this house of God , with ioy ,
And offered at the dedication of this house of God , an hundred bullockes , two hundred rammes , foure hundred lambes ; and for a sinne offering for all Israel , twelue hee goates , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
And they set the Priests in their diuisions , and the Leuites in their courses , for the seruice of God , which is at Ierusalem , as it is written in the booke of Moses .
And the children of the captiuitie kept the Passeouer , vpon the fourteenth day of the first moneth :
For the Priestes and the Leuites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the Passeouer for all the children of the captiuitie , and for their brethren the Priests , and for themselues .
And the children of Israel , which were come againe out of captiuitie , and all such as had separated themselues vnto them , from the filthinesse of the heathen of the land , to seeke the Lord God of Israel , did eate ,
The sonne of Zeraiah , the sonne of Uzzi , the sonne of Bukki , The sonne of Abishua , the sonne of Phinehas , the sonne of Eleazar , the sonne of Aaron the chiefe Priest :
This Ezra went vp from Babylon , and hee was a ready Scribe in the law of Moses , which the Lord God of Israel had giuen : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the Lord his God vpon him . And there went vp some of the children of Israel , and of the Priests , and the Leuites , and the Singers , and the Porters , and the Nethinims , vnto Ierusalem , in the seuenth yeere of Artaxerxes the king .
And he came to Ierusalem in the fifth moneth , which was in the seuenth yeere of the king .
For vpon the first day of the first moneth , began he to go vp from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth moneth , came he to Ierusalem , according to the good hand of his God vpon him .
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seeke the Law of the Lord , and to doe it , and to teach in Israel , Statutes and Iudgements .
¶ Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gaue vnto Ezra the Priest , the Scribe , euen a Scribe of the words of the commandements of the Lord , and of his Statutes to Israel .
Artaxerxes king of kings , Unto Ezra the Priest , a Scribe of the Law of the God of heauen , Perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his Priests , and Leuites in my Realme , which are minded of their owne free - will to goe vp to Ierusalem , goe with thee .
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king , and of his seuen counsellers , to enquire concerning Iudah and Ierusalem , according to the Lawe of thy God , which is in thine hand ;
And to cary the siluer and gold , which the king and his counsellers haue freely offered vnto the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Ierusalem .
And all the siluer and gold , that thou canst find in all the prouince of Babylon , with the free - will offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God , which is in Ierusalem :
That thou maiest buy speedily with this money , bullockes , rammes , lambes , with their meate offerings , and their drinke offerings , and offer them vpon the altar of the house of your God , which is in Ierusalem .
And whatsoeuer shall seeme good to thee , and to thy brethren , to doe with the rest of the siluer and gold ; that doe , after the will of your God .
The vessels also that are giuen thee , for the seruice of the house of thy God , those deliuer thou before the God of Ierusalem .
And whatsoeuer more shall be needfull for the house of thy God , which thou shalt haue occasion to bestowe ; bestowe it out of the kings treasure house .
And I , euen I Artaxerxes the king , doe make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the riuer , that whatsoeuer Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heauen , shall require of you , it be done speedily ,
Unto an hundred talents of siluer , and to an hundred measures of wheate , and to an hundred bathes of wine , and to an hundred bathes of oyle , and salt , without prescribing how much .
Whatsoeuer is commanded by the God of heauen , let it be diligently done , for the house of the God of heauen : for why should there be wrath against the realme of the king and his sonnes ?
Also we certifie you , that touching any of the priests , and Leuites , singers , porters , Nethinims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawfull to impose tolle , tribute , or custome vpon them .
And thou , Ezra , after the wisdome of thy God , that is in thine hand , set magistrates and iudges , which may iudge all the people , that are beyond the riuer , all such as know the lawes of thy God , and teach yee them that knowe them not .
And whosoeuer will not doe the law of thy God , and the law of the king , let iudgement be executed speedily vpon him , whether it be vnto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
¶ Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers , which hath put such a thing as this , in the kings heart , to beautifie the house of the Lord which is in Ierusalem :

These are now the chiefe of their fathers , and this is the genealogie of them that went vp with mee from Babylon , in the reigne of Artaxerxes the king .
Of the sonnes of Phinehas , Gershom : of the sonnes of Ithamar , Daniel : of the sonnes of Dauid , Hattush .
Of the sonnes of Shechaniah , of the sonnes of Pharosh , Zechariah , and with him were reckoned , by genealogie of the males , an hundred and fiftie .
Of the sonnes of Pahath Moab , Elihoenai the sonne of Zerahiah : and with him , two hundred males .
Of the sonnes of Shechaniah , the sonne of Iahaziel , and with him three hundred males .
Of the sonnes also of Adin , Ebed the sonne of Ionathan , and with him fiftie males .
And of the sonnes of Elam , Ieshaiah the sonne of Athaliah , and with him seuentie males .
And of the sonnes of Shephatiah , Zebadiah the sonne of Michael , and with him fourescore males .
Of the sonnes of Ioab , Obadiah the sonne of Iehiel : and with him two hundred and eighteene males .
And of the sonnes of Shelomith , the sonne of Iosiphiah , and with him an hundred and threescore males .
And of the sonnes of Bebai , Zechariah the sonne of Bebai , and with him twenty and eight males .
And of the sonnes of Azgad , Iohanan the sonne of Hakkatan , and with him an hundred and ten males .
And of the last sonnes of Adonikam , whose names are these : Eliphelet , Iehiel , and Shemaiah , and with them threescore males .
Of the sonnes also of Biguai , Uthai , and Zabbud , and with them seuentie males .
¶ And I gathered them together to the riuer , that runneth to Ahaua , and there abode wee in tents three dayes : and I viewed the people , and the Priests , and found there none of the sonnes of Leui .
Then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Iarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chiefe men ; also for Iarib , and for Elnathan , men of vnderstanding .
And I sent them with commandement vnto Iddo the chiefe at the place Casiphia , and I told them what they should say vnto Iddo , and to his brethren the Nethinims , at the place Casiphia , that they should bring vnto vs ministers for the house of our God .
And by the good hand of our God vpon vs , they brought vs a man of vnderstanding , of the sonnes of Mahli the sonne of Leui , the sonne of Israel , and Sherebiah , with his sonnes , and his brethren , eighteene .
And Hashabiah , and with him Ieshaiah of the sonnes of Merari , his brethren , and their sonnes , twentie .
Also of the Nethinims , whom Dauid , and the Princes had appointed for the seruice of the Leuites , two hundred and twentie Nethinims : all of them were expressed by name .
¶ Then I proclaimed a fast there , at the riuer Ahaua , that we might afflict our selues before our God , to seeke of him a right way for vs , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of souldiers and horsmen , to helpe vs against the enemie in the way : because wee had spoken vnto the king , saying , The hand of our God is vpon all them for good , that seeke him , but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him .
So we fasted , and besought our God for this , and hee was intreated of vs .
¶ Then I separated twelue of the chiefe of the Priests , Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them ,
And weighed vnto them the siluer and the gold , and the vessels , euen the offering of the house of our God , which the king and his counsellours , and his lords , and all Israel there present , had offered :
I euen weighed vnto their hand , sixe hundred and fifty talents of siluer , and siluer vessels an hundred talents , and of gold an hundred talents :
Also twenty basons of gold , of a thousand drammes , and two vessels of fine copper , precious as gold .
And I said vnto them , Yee are holy vnto the Lord , the vessels are holy also , and the siluer and the gold are a free - will offring vnto the Lord God of your fathers .
Watch ye , and keepe them , vntill yee weigh them before the chiefe of the Priests , and the Leuites , and chiefe of the fathers of Israel at Ierusalem , in the chambers of the house of the Lord .
So tooke the Priests and the Leuites the weight of the siluer and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Ierusalem , vnto the house of our God .
¶ Then wee departed from the riuer of Ahaua , on the twelfth day of the first moneth , to goe vnto Ierusalem ; and the hand of our God was vpon vs , and hee deliuered vs from the hand of the enemie , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
And we came to Ierusalem , and abode there three dayes .
¶ Now on the fourth day was the siluer and the gold , and the vessels weighed in the house of our God , by the hand of Meremoth the sonne of Uriah the Priest , and with him was Eleazar the sonne of Phinehas , and with them was Iozabad the sonne of Ieshua , and Noadiah the sonne of Binnui , Leuites :
By number , and by weight of uery one : and all the weight was written at that time .
Also the children of those that had bene caried away which were come out of the captiuitie , offered burnt offrings vnto the God of Israel , twelue bullocks for all Israel , ninetie and sixe rammes , seuentie and seuen lambes , twelue hee goates for a sinne offering : All this was a burnt offering vnto the Lord .

Nowe when these things were done , the Princes came to me , saying , The people of Israel , and the priests and the Leuites , haue not separated themselues from the people of the lands , doing according to their abominations , euen of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Iebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites .
For they haue taken of their daughters for themselues , and for their sonnes : so that the holy seed haue mingled themselues with the people of those lands , yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath bin chiefe in this trespasse .
And when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and pluckt off the haire of my head , and of my beard , and sate downe astonied .
Then were assembled vnto me euery one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of the transgression of those that had bene caried away , and I sate astonied , vntill the euening sacrifice .
¶ And at the euening sacrifice , I arose vp from my heauinesse , and hauing rent my garment and my mantle , I fell vpon my knees , and spread out my hands vnto the Lord my God ,
And said , O my God , I am ashamed , and blush to lift vp my face to thee , my God : for our iniquities are increased ouer our head , and our trespasse is growen vp vnto the heauens .
Since the dayes of our fathers , haue wee beene in a great trespasse vnto this day , & for our iniquities haue we , our kings and our priests , bin deliuered into the hand of the kings of the lands , to the sword , to captiuitie , and to a spoile , and to confusion of face , as it is this day .
And now for a litle space grace hath bene shewed from the Lord our God , to leaue vs a remnant to escape , and to giue vs a naile in his holy place , that our God may lighten our eyes , and giue vs a litle reuiuing in our bondage :
For wee were bondmen , yet our God hath not forsaken vs in our bondage , but hath extended mercie vnto vs in the sight of the kings of Persia , to giue vs a reuiuing to set vp the house of our God , and to repaire the desolations thereof , and to giue vs a wall in Iudah and in Ierusalem .
And now , O our God , what shal we say after this ? for we haue forsaken thy commandements ,
Which thou hast commanded by thy seruants the prophets , saying , The land vnto which ye go to possesse it , is an vncleane land , with the filthinesse of the people of the lands , with their abominations , which haue filled it from one end to another , with their vncleannesse .
Nowe therefore giue not your daughters vnto their sonnes , neither take their daughters vnto your sonnes , nor seeke their peace or their wealth for euer : that ye may bee strong , and eate the good of the land , and leaue it for an inheritance to your children for euer .
And after all that is come vpon vs , for our euill deeds , and for our great trespasse , seeing that thou , our God , hast punished vs lesse , then our iniquities deserue , and hast giuen vs such deliuerance as this :
Should wee againe breake thy commandements , and ioyne in affinitie with the people of these abominations ? wouldest thou not be angry with vs , til thou haddest consumed vs , so that there should be no remnant , nor escaping ?

Now when Ezra had praised , and when he had confessed , weeping , and casting himselfe downe before the house of God , there assembled vnto him out of Israel , a very great congregation of men , and women , and children : for the people wept very sore .
And Shechaniah the sonne of Iehiel , one of the sonnes of Elam , answered and said vnto Ezra , Wee haue trespassed against our God , and haue taken strange wiues , of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
Now therefore let vs make a couenant with our God , to put away all the wiues , & such as are borne of them , according to the counsell of my lord , and of those that tremble at the commandement of our God , and lee it be done according to the Law .
Arise , for this matter belongeth vnto thee , wee also will be with thee : be of good courage , and doe it .
Then arose Ezra , and made the chiefe Priests , the Leuites , and all Israel to sweare , that they should doe according to this word : and they sware .
¶ Then Ezra rose vp from before the house of God , and went into the chamber of Iohanan , the sonne of Eliashib : and when hee came thither , hee did eate no bread , nor drinke water : for hee mourned because of the transgression of them that had bene caried away .
And they made Proclamation throughout Iudah and Ierusalem , vnto all the children of the captiuitie , that they should gather themselues together vnto Ierusalem ;
And that whosoeuer would not come within three dayes , according to the counsell of the Princes , and the Elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himselfe separated from the congregation of those that had beene caried away .
¶ Then all the men of Iudah and Beniamin , gathered themselues together vnto Ierusalem , within three dayes : it was the ninth moneth , on the twentieth day of the moneth , and all the people sate in the streete of the house of God , trembling because of this matter , and for the great raine .
And Ezra the Priest stood vp , and said vnto them , Yee haue transgressed , and haue taken strange wiues , to encrease the trespasse of Israel .
Now therefore make confession vnto the Lord God of your fathers , and doe his pleasure : and separate your selues from the people of the land , and from the strange wiues .
Then all the congregation answered , and said with a loude voice , As thou hast said , so must we doe :
But the people are many , and it is a time of much raine , and we are not able to stand without ; neither is this a worke of one day or two : for wee are many that haue transgressed in this thing .
Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand , and let all them which haue taken strange wiues in our cities , come at appointed times , & with them the Elders of euery citie , and the Iudges thereof ; vntill the fierce wrath of our God for this matter , be turned from vs .
¶ Onely Ionathan the sonne of Asahel , and Iahaziah the sonne of Tikuah , were employed about this matter : and Meshullam , and Shabbethai the Leuite , helped them .
And the children of the captiuitie did so : and Ezra the Priest , with certaine chiefe of the fathers , after the house of their fathers , and all of them by their names , were separated , and sate downe in the first day of the tenth moneth to examine the matter .
And they made an ende , with all the men that had taken strange wiues , by the first day of the first moneth .
¶ And among the sonnes of the Priestes , there were found that had taken strange wiues : namely , of the sons of Ieshua the sonne of Iozadak , and his brethren , Maasiah , and Eliezer , and Iarib , and Gedaliah .
And they gaue their hands , that they would put away their wiues : and being guiltie , they offered a ramme of the flocke for their trespasse .
And of the sonnes of Immer , Hanani , and Zebadiah :
And of the sonnes of Harim , Maasiah , and Eliiah , and Shemaiah , and Iehiel , and Uzziah .
And of the sonnes of Pashur : Elioenai , Maasiah , Ishmael , Nethaneel , Iozabad and Elasah .
Also of the Leuites : Iozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah ( the same is Kelitah ) Pethahiah , Iudah , and Eliezer .
Of the singers also , Eliashib ; and of the porters , Shallum , and Telem , and Uri .
Moreouer of Israel , of the sonnes of Parosh , Ramiah , and Iesiah , and Malchiah , and Miamin , and Eleazar , and Malchiiah , and Benaiah .
And of the sonnes of Elam : Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Iehiel , and Abdi , and Ieremoth , and Eliah .
And of the sonnes of Zattu : Elioenai , Eliashib , Mattaniah , and Ieremoth , and Zabad , and Aziza .

Paul an Apostle , not of men , neither by man , but by Iesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ,
And all the brethren which are with mee , vnto the Churches of Galatia :
Grace bee to you and peace , from God the Father , and from our Lord Iesus Christ ,
Who gaue himselfe for our sinnes , that he might deliuer vs from this present euill world , according to the will of God , and our Father ,
To whom bee glorie for euer and euer , Amen .
I marueile , that you are so soone remoued from him , that called you into the grace of Christ , vnto an other Gospel :
Which is not another ; but there bee some that trouble you , and would peruert the Gospel of Christ .
But though we , or an Angel from heauen , preach any other Gospel vnto you , then that which wee haue preached vnto you , let him be accursed .
As we said before , so say I now againe , If any man preach any other Gospel vnto you , then that yee haue receiued , let him be accursed .
For doe I now perswade men , or God ? or doe I seeke to please men ? For if I yet pleased men , I should not bee the seruant of Christ .
But I certifie you , brethren , that the Gospel which was preached of me , is not after man .
For I neither receiued it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the reuelation of Iesus Christ .
For yee haue heard of my couuersation in time past , in the Iewes Religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God , and wasted it :
And profited in the Iewes Religion , aboue many my equals in mine owne nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
But when it pleased God , who separated me from my mothers wombe , and called me by his grace ,
To reueale his sonne in mee , that I might preach him among the heathen , immediatly I conferred not with flesh and blood :
Neither went I vp to Ierusalem , to them which were Apostles before me , but I went into Arabia , and returned againe vnto Damascus .
Then after three yeeres , I went vp to Ierusalem to see Peter , and abode with him fifteene dayes .
But other of the Apostles saw I none , saue Iames the Lords brother .
Now the things which I write vnto you , behold , before God I lye not .
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ,
And was vnknowen by face vnto the Churches of Iudea , which were in Christ .
But they had heard onely , that he which persecuted vs in times past , now preacheth the faith , which once hee destroyed .
<NON-VERSE>
Then fourteene yeeres after , I went vp againe to Ierusalem with Barnabas , and tooke Titus with me also .
And I went vp by reuelation , and communicated vnto them that Gospel , which I preach among the Gentiles , but priuately to them which were of reputation , lest by any meanes I should runne , or had runne in vaine .
But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greeke , was compelled to be circumcised :
And that because of false brethren vnawares brought in , who came in priuily to spie out our libertie , which wee haue in Christ Iesus , that they might bring vs into bondage .
To whom wee gaue place by subiection , no not for an houre , that the trueth of the Gospel might continue with you .
But of these , who seemed to bee somewhat , ( whatsoeuer they were , it maketh no matter to mee , God accepteth no mans person , ) for they who seemed to be somewhat , in conference added nothing to me .
But contrariwise , when they saw that the Gospel of the vncircumcision was committed vnto me , as the Gospel of the circumcision was vnto Peter :
( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mightie in me towards the Gentiles . )
And when Iames , Cephas and Iohn , who seemed to bee pillars , perceiued the grace that was giuen vnto me , they gaue to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship , that wee should goe vnto the heathen , and they vnto the circumcision .
Onely they would that wee should remember the poore , the same which I also was forward to doe .
But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
For before that certaine came from Iames , he did eate with the Gentiles : but when they were come , hee withdrew , and separated himselfe , fearing them which were of the Circumcision
And the other Iewes dissembled likewise with him , insomuch that Barnabas also was caried away with their dissimulation .
But when I saw that they walked not vprightly according to the truth of the Gospel , I said vnto Peter before them al , If thou , being a Iew , liuest after the maner of Gentiles , and not as doe the Iewes , why compellest thou the Gentiles to liue as do the Iewes ?
We who are Iewes by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
Knowing that a man is not iustified by the works of the Law , but by the faith of Iesus Christ , euen we haue beleeued in Iesus Christ , that we might be iustified by the faith of Christ , and not by the workes of the Law : for by the workes of the Law shall no flesh be iustified .
But if while we seeke to be iustified by Christ , wee our selues also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sinne ? God forbid .
I am crucified with Christ . Neuertheles , I liue , yet not I , but Christ liueth in me , and the life which I now liue in the flesh , I liue by the faith of the sonne of God , who loued mee , and gaue himselfe for me .
<NON-VERSE>
O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that you should not obey the trueth , before whose eyes Iesus Christ hath been euidently set forth , crucified among you ?
This onely would I learne of you , receiued ye the spirit , by the works of the Law , or by the hearing of faith ?
Are ye so foolish ? hauing begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
Haue ye suffered so many things in vaine ? if it be yet in vaine .
He therfore that ministreth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the workes of the Law , or by the hearing of faith ?
Euen as Abraham beleeued God , and it was accounted to him for righteousnesse .
Knowe yee therefore , that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
And the Scripture foreseeing that God would iustifie the heathen through faith , preached before the Gospel vnto Abraham , saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed .
So then , they which bee of faith , are blessed with faithfull Abraham .
For as many as are of the works of the lawe , are vnder the curse : for it is written , Cursed is euery one that continueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them .
But that no man is iustified by the Lawe in the sight of God , it is euident : for , The iust shall liue by faith .
And the Law is not of faith : but the man that doeth them , shall liue in them .
Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Law , being made a curse for vs : for it is written , Cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree :
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles , through Iesus Christ : that wee might receiue the promise of the Spirit through faith .
Brethren , I speake after the maner of men : though it be but a mans couenant , yet if it bee confirmed , no man disanulleth , or addeth thereto .
Now to Abraham and his seede were the promises made . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many , but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .
And this I say , that the Couenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the Lawe which was foure hundred and thirtie yeres after , cannot disanul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
For if the inheritance bee of the Law , it is no more of promise : but God gaue it to Abraham by promise .
Wherefore then serueth the Law ? it was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come , to whome the promise was made , and it was ordeyned by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour .
Now a mediatour is not a Mediatour of one , but God is one .
Is the Lawe then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had beene a Lawe giuen which could haue giuen life , verily righteousnesse should haue bene by the Law .
But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne , that the promise by faith of Iesus Christ might be giuen to them that beleeue .
But before faith came , wee were kept vnder the Law , shut vp vnto the faith , which should afterwards bee reuealed .
Wherefore the Law was our Schoolemaster to bring vs vnto Christ , that we might be iustified by Faith .
But after that Faith is come , we are no longer vnder a Schoolemaster .
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Iesus .
For as many of you as haue bene baptized into Christ , haue put on Christ .
There is neither Iewe , nor Greeke , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Iesus .
<NON-VERSE>
Now I say , that the heire , as long as hee is a child , differeth nothing from a seruant , though hee bee Lord of all ,
But is vnder tutors and gouernours vntill the time appointed of the father .
Euen so we , when wee were children , were in bondage vnder the Elements of the world :
But when the fulnes of the time was come , God sent foorth his Sonne made of a woman , made vnder the Law ,
To redeeme them that were vnder the Law , that we might receiue the adoption of sonnes .
And because yee are sonnes , God hath sent foorth the spirit of his Sonne into your hearts , crying Abba , Father .
Wherefore thou art no more a seruant , but a sonne ; and if a sonne , then an heire of God through Christ .
Howbeit , then when ye knew not God , yee did seruice vnto them which by nature are no Gods .
But now after that yee haue knowen God , or rather are knowen of God , how turne ye againe to the weak and beggerly Elements , whereunto ye desire againe to be in bondage ?
Yee obserue dayes , and moneths , and times , and yeeres .
I am afraide of you , lest I haue bestowed vpon you labour in vaine .
Brethren , I beseech you , be as I am ; for I am as ye are , ye haue not iniured me at all .
Ye know how through infirmitie of the flesh , I preached the Gospel vnto you at the first .
And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor reiected , but receiued mee as an Angel of God , euen as Christ Iesus .
Where is then the blessednes you spake of ? for I beare you record , that if it had bin possible , ye would haue plucked out your own eyes , and haue giuen them to me .
Am I therefore become your enemie , because I tell you the trueth ?
They zelously affect you , but not well : yea , they would exclude you , that you might affect them .
But it is good to bee zealously affected alwayes in a good thing , and not onely when I am present with you .
My litle children , of whom I trauaile in birth againe , vntill Christ bee formed in you :
I desire to bee present with you now , and to change my voyce , for I stand in doubt of you .
Tell me , ye that desire to be vnder the Law , doe ye not heare the Law ?
For it is written , that Abraham had two sonnes , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
But he who was of the bondwoman , was borne after the flesh : but hee of the freewoman , was by promise . Which things are an Allegorie ; for these are the two Couenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar .
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Ierusalem , which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
But Ierusalem which is aboue is free , which is the mother of vs all .
For it is written , Reioyce thou barren that bearest not , breake foorth and cry thou that traueilest not ; for the desolate hath many moe children then she which hath an husband .
Now wee , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise .
But as then hee that was borne after the flesh , persecuted him that was borne after the Spirit , euen so it is now .
Neuerthelesse , what saith the Scripture ? Cast out the bondwoman and her sonne : for the son of the bondwoman shall not bee heire with the son of the freewoman .
<NON-VERSE>
Stand fast therefore in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made vs free , and bee not intangled againe with the yoke of bondage .
Beholde , I Paul say vnto you that if ye be circumcised , Christ shal profite you nothing .
For I testifie againe to euery man that is circumcised , that he is a debtor to doe the whole Law .
Christ is become of no effect vnto you , whosoeuer of you are iustified by the Law : ye are fallen from grace .
For we through the spirit waite for the hope of righteousnesse by faith .
For in Iesus Christ , neither circumcision auaileth any thing , nor vncircumcision , but faith which worketh by loue . Ye did run well ; who did hinder you , that ye should not obey the trueth ?
This perswasion commeth not of him that calleth you .
A little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe .
I would they were euen cut off which trouble you .
For brethren , ye haue beene called vnto liberty , onely vse not libertie for an occasion to the flesh , but by loue serue one another .
For all the Law is fulfilled in one word , euen in this : Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe .
But if yee bite and deuoure one another , take heed ye be not consumed one of another .
This I say then , Walke in the spirit , and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh .
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that yee cannot doe the things that yee would .
But if yee be lead of the spirit , yee are not vnder the Law .
Nowe the workes of the flesh are manifest , which are these , adulterie , fornication , vncleannesse , lasciuiousnesse ,
Idolatrie , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies ,
Enuyings , murthers , drunkennesse , reuellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I haue also tolde you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherite the kingdome of God .
But the fruit of the spirit is loue , ioy , peace , long suffering , gentlenesse , goodnesse , faith ,
Meekenesse , temperance : against such there is no law .
And they that are Christs , haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lustes .
If we liue in the Spirit , let vs also walke in the Spirit .
<NON-VERSE>
Brethren , if a man bee ouertaken in a fault : yee which are spirituall , restore such a one in the spirit of meeknesse , considering thy selfe least thou also be tempted .
Beare ye one anothers burthens , and so fulfill the Law of Christ .
For if a man thinke himselfe to be something , when he is nothing , hee deceiueth himselfe .
But let euery man prooue his owne worke , and then shall he haue reioycing in him selfe alone , and not in an other .
For euery man shall beare his owne burthen .
Let him that is taught in the word , communicate vnto him that teacheth , in all good things .
Be not deceiued , God is not mocked : for whatsoeuer a man soweth , that shall he also reape .
For hee that soweth to his flesh , shall of the flesh reape corruption : but he that soweth to the spirit , shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting .
And let vs not bee weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reape , if we faint not .
As we haue therefore opportunitie , let vs doe good vnto all men , especially vnto them who are of the household of faith .
Ye see how large a letter I haue written vnto you with mine owne hand .
As many as desire to make a faire shew in the flesh , they constraine you to be Circumcised : onely least they should suffer persecution for the Crosse of Christ .
For neither they themselues who are circumcised , keepe the Law , but desire to haue you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
But God forbid that I should glory , saue in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified vnto me , & I vnto the world .
For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision auaileth any thing nor vncircumcision , but a new creature .
And as many as walke according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercie , and vpon the Israel of God .
From henceforth let no man trouble mee , for I beare in my body the markes of the Lord Iesus .

In the beginning God created the Heauen , and the Earth .
And the earth was without forme , and voyd , and darkenesse was vpon the face of the deepe : and the Spirit of God mooued vpon the face of the waters .
And God said , Let there be light : and there was light .
And God saw the light , that it was good : and God diuided the light from the darkenesse .
And God called the light , Day , and the darknesse he called Night : and the euening and the morning were the first day .
¶ And God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters : and let it diuide the waters from the waters .
And God made the firmament ; and diuided the waters , which were vnder the firmament , from the waters , which were aboue the firmament : and it was so .
And God called the firmament , Heauen : and the euening and the morning were the second day .
¶ And God said , Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered together vnto one place , and let the dry land appeare : and it was so .
And God called the drie land , Earth , and the gathering together of the waters called hee , Seas : and God saw that it was good .
And God said , Let the Earth bring foorth grasse , the herbe yeelding seed , and the fruit tree , yeelding fruit after his kinde , whose seed is in it selfe , vpon the earth : and it was so .
And the earth brought foorth grasse , and herbe yeelding seed after his kinde , and the tree yeelding fruit , whose seed was in it selfe , after his kinde : and God saw that it was good .
And the euening and the morning were the third day .
¶ And God said , Let there bee lights in the firmament of the heauen , to diuide the day from the night : and let them be for signes and for seasons , and for dayes and yeeres .
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heauen , to giue light vpon the earth : and it was so .
And God made two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he made the starres also .
And God set them in the firmament of the heauen , to giue light vpon the earth :
And to rule ouer the day , and ouer the night , and to diuide the light from the darkenesse : and God saw that it was good .
And the euening and the morning were the fourth day .
And God said , Let the waters bring foorth aboundantly the mouing creature that hath life , and foule that may flie aboue the earth in the open firmament of heauen .
And God created great whales , and euery liuing creature that moueth , which the waters brought forth aboundantly after their kinde , and euery winged foule after his kinde : and God saw that it was good .
And God blessed them , saying , Be fruitfull , and multiply , and fill the waters in the Seas , and let foule multiply in the earth .
And the euening and the morning were the fift day .
¶ And God said , Let the earth bring forth the liuing creature after his kinde , cattell , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kinde : and it was so .
And God made the beast of the earth after his kinde , and cattell after their kinde , and euery thing that creepeth vpon the earth , after his kinde : and God saw that it was good .
¶ And God said , Let vs make man in our Image , after our likenesse : and let them haue dominion ouer the fish of the sea , and ouer the foule of the aire , and ouer the cattell , and ouer all the earth , and ouer euery creeping thing that creepeth vpon the earth .
So God created man in his owne Image , in the Image of God created hee him ; male and female created hee them .
And God blessed them , and God said vnto them , Be fruitfull , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it , and haue dominion ouer the fish of the sea , and ouer the foule of the aire , and ouer euery liuing thing that mooueth vpon the earth .
¶ And God said , Behold , I haue giuen you euery herbe bearing seede , which is vpon the face of all the earth , and euery tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yeelding seed , to you it shall be for meat :
And to euery beast of the earth , and to euery foule of the aire , and to euery thing that creepeth vpon the earth , wherein there is life , I haue giuen euery greene herbe for meat : and it was so .

Thus the heauens and the earth were finished , and all the hoste of them .
And on the seuenth day God ended his worke , which hee had made : And he rested on the seuenth day from all his worke , which he had made .
And God blessed the seuenth day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his worke , which God created and made .
¶ These are the generations of the heauens , & of the earth , when they were created ; in the day that the LORD God made the earth , and the heauens ,
And euery plant of the field , before it was in the earth , and euery herbe of the field , before it grew : for the LORD God had not caused it to raine vpon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
But there went vp a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , & breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a liuing soule .
¶ And the LORD God planted a garden Eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow euery tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food : the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and euill .
And a riuer went out of Eden to water the garden , and from thence it was parted , and became into foure heads .
The name of the first is Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Hauilah , where there is gold . And the gold of that land is good : There is Bdellium and the Onix stone .
And the name of the second riuer is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
And the name of the third riuer is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the East of Assyria : and the fourth riuer is Euphrates .
And the LORD God tooke the man , and put him into the garden of Eden , to dresse it , and to keepe it .
And the LORD God commanded the man , saying , Of euery tree of the garden thou mayest freely eate .
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill , thou shalt not eate of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die .
¶ And the LORD God said , It is not good that the man should be alone : I will make him an helpe meet for him .
And out of the ground the LORD God formed euery beast of the field , and euery foule of the aire , and brought them vnto Adam , to see what he would call them : and whatsoeuer Adam called euery liuing creature , that was the name thereof .
And Adam gaue names to all cattell , and to the foule of the aire , and to euery beast of the fielde : but for Adam there was not found an helpe meete for him .
And the LORD God caused a deepe sleepe to fall vpon Adam , and hee slept ; and he tooke one of his ribs , and closed vp the flesh in stead thereof .
And the rib which the LORD God had taken from man , made hee a woman , & brought her vnto the man .
And Adam said , This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shalbe called woman , because shee was taken out of man .
Therefore shall a man leaue his father and his mother , and shall cleaue vnto his wife : and they shalbe one flesh .

Now the serpent was more subtill then any beast of the field , which the LORD God had made , and he said vnto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of euery tree of the garden ?
And the woman said vnto the serpent , Wee may eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden :
But of the fruit of the tree , which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shal not eate of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
And the Serpent said vnto the woman , Ye shall not surely die .
For God doeth know , that in the day ye eate thereof , then your eyes shalbee opened : and yee shall bee as Gods , knowing good and euill .
And when the woman saw , that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she tooke of the fruit thereof , and did eate , and gaue also vnto her husband with her , and hee did eate .
And the eyes of them both were opened , & they knew that they were naked , and they sewed figge leaues together , and made themselues aprons .
And they heard the voyce of the LORD God , walking in the garden in the coole of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselues from the presence of the LORD God , amongst the trees of the garden .
And the LORD God called vnto Adam , and said vnto him , Where art thou ?
And he said , I heard thy voice in the garden : and I was afraid , because I was naked , and I hid my selfe .
And he said , Who told thee , that thou wast naked ? Hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded thee , that thou shouldest not eate ?
And the man said , The woman whom thou gauest to be with mee , shee gaue me of the tree , and I did eate .
And the LORD God said vnto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? And the woman said , The Serpent beguiled me , and I did eate .
And the LORD God said vnto the Serpent , Because thou hast done this , thou art cursed aboue all cattel , and aboue euery beast of the field : vpon thy belly shalt thou goe , and dust shalt thou eate , all the dayes of thy life .
And I will put enmitie betweene thee and the woman , and betweene thy seed and her seed : it shal bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise his heele .
Unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorowe and thy conception . In sorow thou shalt bring forth children : and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and hee shall rule ouer thee .
And vnto Adam he said , Because thou hast hearkened vnto the voyce of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree , of which I commaunded thee , saying , Thou shalt not eate of it : cursed is the ground for thy sake : in sorow shalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life .
Thornes also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee : and thou shalt eate the herbe of the field .
In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread , till thou returne vnto the ground : for out of it wast thou taken , for dust thou art , and vnto dust shalt thou returne .
And Adam called his wiues name Eue , because she was the mother of all liuing .
Unto Adam also , and to his wife , did the LORD God make coates of skinnes , and cloathed them .
¶ And the LORD God said , Behold , the man is become as one of vs , to know good & euill . And now lest hee put foorth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eate and liue for euer :
Therefore the LORD God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground , from whence he was taken .

And Adam knew Eue his wife , and shee conceiued , and bare Cain , and said , I haue gotten a man from the LORD .
And she againe bare his brother Abel , and Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
And in processe of time it came to passe , that Cain brought of the fruite of the ground , an offering vnto the LORD .
And Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flocke , and of the fat thereof : and the LORD had respect vnto Abel , and to his offering .
But vnto Cain , and to his offring he had not respect : and Cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
And the LORD said vnto Cain , Why art thou wroth ? And why is thy countenance fallen ?
If thou doe well , shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well , sinne lieth at the doore : And vnto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule ouer him .
And Cain talked with Abel his brother : and it came to passe when they were in the field , that Cain rose vp against Abel his brother , and slew him .
¶ And the LORD said vnto Cain , Where is Abel thy brother ? And hee said , I know not : Am I my brothers keeper ?
And he said , What hast thou done ? the voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto me , from the ground .
And now art thou cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receiue thy brothers blood from thy hand .
When thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yeeld vnto thee her strength : A fugitiue and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
And Cain said vnto the LORD , My punishment is greater , then I can beare .
Behold , thou hast driuen me out this day from the face of the earth , and from thy face shall I be hid , and I shall be a fugitiue , and a vagabond in the earth : and it shall come to passe , that euery one that findeth me , shall slay me .
And the LORD said vnto him , Therefore whosoeuer slayeth Cain , vengeance shalbe taken on him seuen fold . And the LORD set a marke vpon Cain , lest any finding him , should kill him .
¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD , and dwelt in the land of Nod , on the East of Eden .
And Cain knew his wife , and she conceiued and bare Enoch , and hee builded a City , and called the name of the City , after the name of his sonne , Enoch .
And vnto Enoch was borne Irad : and Irad begate Mehuiael , and Mehuiael begate Methusael , and Methusael begate Lamech .
¶ And Lamech tooke vnto him two wiues : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
And Adah bare Iabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as haue cattell .
And his brothers name was Iubal : hee was the father of all such as handle the harpe and organ .
And Zillah , she also bare Tubal - Cain , an instructer of euery artificer in brasse and iron : and the sister of Tubal - Cain was Naamah .
And Lamech sayd vnto his wiues , Adah and Zillah , Heare my voyce , yee wiues of Lamech , hearken vnto my speech : for I haue slaine a man to my wounding , and a yong man to my hurt .
If Cain shall bee auenged seuen fold , truely Lamech seuenty and seuen folde .

Euery mouing thing that liueth , shalbe meat for you ; euen as the greene herbe haue I giuen you all things .
But flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall you not eate .
And surely your blood of your liues will I require : at the hand of euery beast will I require it , & at the hand of man , at the hand of euery mans brother will I require the life of man .
Who so sheddeth mans blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .

I doe set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a couenant , betweene me and the earth .
And it shall come to passe , when I bring a cloud ouer the earth , that the bow shall be seene in the cloud .

These are the sonnes of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands after their nations .

And the whole earth was of one language , and of one speach .
And it came to passe as they iourneyed from the East , that they found a plaine in the land of Shinar , and they dwelt there .
And they sayd one to another ; Goe to , let vs make bricke , and burne them thorowly . And they had bricke for stone , and slime had they for morter .
And they said ; Goe to , let vs build vs a city and a tower , whose top may reach vnto heauen , and let vs make vs a name , lest we be scattered abroad vpon the face of the whole earth .
And the LORD came downe to see the city and the tower , which the children of men builded .
And the LORD said ; Behold , the people is one , and they haue all one language : and this they begin to doe : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they haue imagined to doe .
Goe to , let vs go downe , and there confound their language , that they may not vnderstand one anothers speech .
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence , vpon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the Citie .
Therefore is the name of it called Babel , because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad vpon the face of all the earth .
¶ These are the generations of Shem . Shem was an hundred yeres old , and begate Arphaxad two yeeres after the Flood .
And Shem liued , after he begate Arphaxad , fiue hundred yeeres , and begate sonnes and daughters . And Arphaxad liued fiue and thirtie yeeres , and begate Salah .
And Arphaxad liued , after he begate Salah , foure hundred and three yeeres , and begate sonnes and daughters . And Salah liued thirtie yeeres , and begate Eber .
And Salah liued , after hee begate Eber , foure hundred and three yeeres , and begate sonnes and daughters .
And Peleg liued thirtie yeeres , and begate Reu . And Peleg liued , after hee begate Reu , two hundred and nine yeeres , and begate sonnes and daughters .
And Reu liued two and thirtie yeeres , and begate Serug .
And Nahor liued , after he begate Terah , an hundred & nineteene yeeres , and begate sonnes and daughters .
And Terah liued seuenty yeeres , and begate Abram , Nahor , & Haran .
¶ Now these are the generations of Terah : Terah begate Abram , Nahor , and Haran : And Haran begate Lot .
And Haran died , before his father Terah in the land of his natiuity , in Ur of the Chaldees .
And Abram and Nahor tooke them wiues : the name of Abrams wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahors wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
But Sarai was barren ; she had no childe .
And Terah tooke Abram his sonne , and Lot the sonne of Haran his sonnes sonne , and Sarai his daughter in lawe , his sonne Abrams wife , and they went foorth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to goe into the land of Canaan : and they came vnto Haran , and dwelt there .

Now the LORD had said vnto Abram , Get thee out of thy countrey , and from thy kinred , and from thy fathers house , vnto a land that I will shew thee .
And I will make of thee a great nation , and I wil blesse thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt bee a blessing .
And I will blesse them that blesse thee , and curse him , that curseth thee : and in thee shal all families of the earth be blessed . So Abram departed , as the LORD had spoken vnto him , and Lot went with him : And Abram was seuentie and fiue yeeres old when he departed out of Haran .
And Abram tooke Sarai his wife , and Lot his brothers sonne , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the soules that they had gotten in Haran , and they went foorth to goe into the land of Canaan : and into the land of Canaan they came .
¶ And Abram passed through the land , vnto the place of Sichem , vnto the plaine of Moreh . And the Canaanite was then in the land .
And the LORD appeared vnto Abram , and said , Unto thy seed wil I giue this land : and there builded hee an altar vnto the LORD , who appeared vnto him .
And he remoued from thence vnto a mountaine , on the East of Beth - el , and pitched his tent hauing Beth - el on the West , and Hai on the East : and there hee builded an altar vnto the LORD , and called vpon the Name of the LORD .
And Abram iourneyed , going on still toward the South .
¶ And there was a famine in the land , and Abram went downe into Egypt , to soiourne there : for the famine was grieuous in the land .
And it came to passe when he was come neere to enter into Egypt , that he said vnto Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a faire woman to looke vpon .
Therefore it shall come to passe , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will saue thee aliue .
Say , I pray thee , thou art my sister , that it may be wel with me , for thy sake ; and my soule shall liue , because of thee .
¶ And it came to passe , that when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman , that shee was very faire .
The Princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh : and the woman was taken into Pharaohs house .
And he entreated Abram well for her sake : and he had sheepe , and oxen , and hee asses , and men seruants , and maid seruants , and shee asses , and camels .
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh & his house with great plagues , because of Sarai Abrams wife .
And Pharaoh called Abram , and said , What is this that thou hast done vnto me ? Why diddest thou not tell me , that she was thy wife ?
Why saidest thou , Shee is my sister ? so I might haue taken her to mee to wife : now therfore behold , thy wife , take her and goe thy way .

And Abram went vp out of Egypt , he and his wife , and all that he had , and Lot with him , into the South .
And Abram was very rich in cattell , in siluer , and in gold .
And hee went on his iourneyes from the South , euen to Beth - el , vnto the place where his tent had bene at the beginning , betweene Beth - el and Hai :
Unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there Abram called on the Name of the LORD .
¶ And Lot also which went with Abram , had flocks and heards , & tents .
And the land was not able to beare them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
And there was a strife betweene the heardmen of Abrams cattell , and the heardmen of Lots cattell : And the Canaanite , and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
And Abram said vnto Lot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , betweene mee and thee , and betweene my heardmen and thy heardmen : for wee bee brethren .
Is not the whole land before thee ? Separate thy selfe , I pray thee , from mee : if thou wilt take the left hand , then I will goe to the right : or if thou depart to the right hand , then I will goe to the left .
And Lot lifted vp his eyes , and beheld all the plaine of Iordane , that it was well watered euery where before the Lord destroyed Sodome and Gomorah , euen as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou commest vnto Zoar .
Then Lot chose him all the plaine of Iordane : and Lot iourneyed East ; and they separated themselues the one from the other .
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan , and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plaine , and pitched his tent toward Sodome .
But the men of Sodome were wicked , and sinners before the LORD exceedingly .
¶ And the LORD said vnto Abram , after that Lot was separated from him , Lift vp now thine eyes , and looke from the place where thou art , Northward , and Southward , and Eastward , and Westward .
For all the land which thou seest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seede for euer .
And I will make thy seede as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbred .
Arise , walke through the land , in the length of it , and in the breadth of it : for I will giue it vnto thee .

And it came to passe in the dayes of Amraphel King of Shinar , Arioch King of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer King of Elam , and Tidal King of nations :
That these made warre with Bera King of Sodome , and with Birsha King of Gomorrah , Shinab King of Admah , and Shemeber King of Zeboiim , and the King of Bela , which is Zoar .
All these were ioyned together in the vale of Siddim ; which is the salt Sea .
Twelue yeeres they serued Chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth yeere they rebelled .
And in the fourteenth yeere came Chedorlaomer , and the Kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaims , in Ashteroth Karnaim , & the Zuzims in Ham , and the Emims in Shaueh Kiriathaim ;
And the Horites in their mount Seir , vnto El - Paran , which is by the wildernesse .
And they returned , and came to En - mishpat , which is Kadesh , & smote all the countrey of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that dwelt in Hazezon - tamar . And there went out the King of Sodome , and the King of Gomorrah , and the King of Admah , and the King of Zeboiim , and the King of Bela , ( the same is Zoar ) and they ioyned battell with them , in the vale of Siddim ,
With Chedorlaomer the King of Elam , and with Tidal King of nations , and Amraphel King of Shinar , and Arioch King of Ellasar ; foure Kings with fiue .
And the vale of Siddim was full of slime - pits : and the Kings of Sodome & Gomorrah fled , and fell there : and they that remained , fled to the mountaine .
And they tooke all the goods of Sodome and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
And they tooke Lot , Abrams brothers sonne , ( who dwelt in Sodome ) and his goods , and departed .
¶ And there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew , for hee dwelt in the plaine of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eshcol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captiue , he armed his trained seruants borne in his owne house , three hundred and eighteene , and pursued them vnto Dan .
And hee diuided himselfe against them , he and his seruants by night , and smote them , and pursued them vnto Hoba , which is on the left hand of Damascus :
And hee brought backe all the goods , and also brought againe his brother Lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
¶ And the king of Sodome went out to meete him , ( after his returne from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer , and of the Kings that were with him ) at the valley of Saueh , which is the Kings dale .
And Melchizedek King of Salem brought foorth bread and wine : and he was the Priest of the most high God .
And hee blessed him , and saide ; Blessed bee Abram of the most high God , possessour of heauen and earth ,
And blessed bee the most high God , which hath deliuered thine enemies into thy hand : and hee gaue him tithes of all .
And the King of Sodome said vnto Abram , giue me the persons , and take the goods to thy selfe .
And Abram said to the King of Sodome , I haue lift vp my hand vnto the LORD , the most high God , the possessour of heauen and earth ,
That I wil not take from a threed euen to a shoe latchet , and that I will not take any thing that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , I haue made Abram rich :

After these things , the word of the LORD came vnto Abram in a vision , saying ; Feare not , Abram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
And Abram said , Lord GOD , what wilt thou giue me , seeing I goe childlesse ? and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus .
And Abram said ; Behold , to mee thou hast given no seed : and loe , one borne in my house is mine heire .
And behold , the word of the LORD came vnto him , saying ; This shall not be thine heire : but he that shall come foorth out of thy owne bowels , shalbe thine heire .
And he brought him forth abroad , and said , Looke now towards heauen , and tell the starres , if thou be able to number them . And hee said vnto him , So shall thy seed be .
And he beleeued in the LORD ; and hee counted it to him for righteousnesse .
And he said vnto him ; I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Caldees , to give thee this land , to inherit it .
And he said , Lord GOD , whereby shal I know that I shall inherit it ?
And he said vnto him , Take me an heifer of three yeeres old , and a shee goat of three yeeres old , and a ramme of three yeeres old , and a turtle doue , and a yong pigeon .
And he tooke vnto him all these , and diuided them in the midst , and layd each peece one against another : but the birds diuided he not .
And when the fowles came downe vpon the carcases , Abram droue them away .
And when the Sunne was going downe , a deepe sleepe fell vpon Abram : and loe , an horrour of great darkenesse fell vpon him .
And he said vnto Abram , Know of a surety , that thy seed shalbe a stranger , in a land that is not theirs , and shal serue them , and they shall afflict them foure hundred yeeres .
And also that nation whom they shall serue , wil I iudge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
And thou shalt goe to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
But in the fourth generation they shall come hither againe : for the iniquitie of the Amorites is not yet full .
And it came to passe that when the Sunne went downe , and it was darke , behold , a smoking furnace , and a burning lampe that passed betweene those pieces .
In that same day the LORD made a couenant with Abram , saying ; Unto thy seed haue I giuen this land from the riuer of Egypt vnto the great riuer , the riuer Euphrates : The Kenites , and the Kenizites , and the Kadmonites :
And the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaims ,

Now Sarai Abrams wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaide , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
And Sarai said vnto Abram , Behold now , the LORD hath restrained me from bearing : I pray thee go in vnto my maid : it may bee that I may obtaine children by her : and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai .
And Sarai Abrams wife , tooke Hagar her maid , the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten yeeres in the land of Canaan , and gaue her to her husband Abram , to be his wife .
¶ And he went in vnto Hagar , and she conceiued : And when shee saw that shee had conceiued , her mistresse was despised in her eyes .
And Sarai said vnto Abram , My wrong be vpon thee : I haue giuen my maid into thy bosome , and when shee saw that she had conceiued , I was despised in her eyes : the LORD iudge betweene me and thee .
But Abram said vnto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thy hand ; doe to her as it pleaseth thee . And when Sarai dealt hardly with her , shee fled from her face .
¶ And the Angel of the LORD found her by a fountaine of water , in the wildernesse , by the fountaine , in the way to Shur :
And he said , Hagar Sarais maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou goe ? And she said , I flee from the face of my mistresse Sarai .
And the Angel of the LORD said vnto her , Returne to thy mistresse , and submit thy selfe vnder her hands .
And the Angel of the LORD said vnto her , I will multiply thy seede exceedingly , that it shall not be numbred for multitude .
And the Angel of the LORD said vnto her , Behold , thou art with child , and shalt beare a sonne , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction .
And he will be a wilde man ; his hand will be against euery man , and euery mans hand against him : & he shal dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
And shee called the name of the LORD that spake vnto her , Thou God seest me : for she said , Haue I also here looked after him that seeth me ?
Wherefore the well was called , Beer - lahai - roi : Behold , It is betweene Cadesh and Bered .

And when Abram was ninetie yeres old and nine , the LORD appeared to Abram , and said vnto him , I am the almightie God , walke before me , and be thou perfect .
And I wil make my couenant betweene me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
And Abram fell on his face , and God talked with him , saying ,
As for me , behold , my couenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall bee Abraham : for a father of many nations haue I made thee .
And I will make thee exceeding fruitfull , and I will make nations of thee , and Kings shall come out of thee .
And I will establish my couenant betweene me and thee , and thy seede after thee , in their generations for an euerlasting couenant , to bee a God vnto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
And I will giue vnto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an euerlasting possession , and I will be their God .
¶ And God said vnto Abraham , Thou shalt keepe my couenant therefore , thou , and thy seede after thee , in their generations .
This is my couenant , which yee shall keepe betweene me and you , and thy seed after thee : euery man child among you shall be circumcised .
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskinne ; and it shal be a token of the couenant betwixt me and you .
And he that is eight dayes olde , shalbe circumcised among you , euery man child in your generations , he that is borne in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
He that is borne in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my couenant shall be in your flesh , for an euerlasting couenant .
And the vncircumcised man - child , whose flesh of his foreskinne is not circumcised , that soule shall be cut off from his people : hee hath broken my couenant .
¶ And God said vnto Abraham , As for Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall her name be .
And I will blesse her , and giue thee a sonne also of her : yea I wil blesse her , and she shalbe a mother of nations ; Kings of people shall be of her .
Then Abraham fell vpon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be borne vnto him that is an hundred yeeres old ? and shal Sarah that is ninetie yeeres old , beare ?
And Abraham said vnto God , O that Ishmael might liue before thee .
And God said , Sarah thy wife shall beare thee a sonne in deede , and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my couenant with him , for an euerlasting couenant , and with his seed after him .
And as for Ishmael , I haue heard thee : behold , I haue blessed him , and will make him fruitfull , and will multiplie him exceedingly : Twelue princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
But my couenant wil I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall beare vnto thee , at this set time , in the next yeere .
And the LORD appeared vnto him , in the plaines of Mamre : and he sate in the tent doore , in the heat of the day .
And he lift vp his eyes and looked , and loe , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , hee ranne to meete them from the tent doore , and bowed himselfe toward the ground ,
And said , My Lord , If now I haue found fauour in thy sight , passe not away , I pray thee , from thy seruant :
Let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feete , and rest your selues vnder the tree :
And I will fetch a morsell of bread ; and comfort ye your hearts , after that you shall passe on : for therefore are you come to your seruant . And they said ; So doe , as thou hast said .
And Abraham hastened into the tent , vnto Sarah , & said ; Make ready quickly three measures of fine meale , knead it , and make cakes vpon the hearth .
And Abraham ranne vnto the heard , and fetcht a calfe , tender and good , and gaue it vnto a yong man : and he hasted to dresse it .
And he tooke butter , and milke , and the calfe which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them vnder the tree : and they did eate .
¶ And they said vnto him , Where is Sarah thy wife ? And he said , Behold , in the tent .
And he said , I will certainly returne vnto thee according to the time of life ; and loe , Sarah thy wife shall haue a sonne . And Sarah heard it in the tent doore , which was behind him .
Now Abraham and Sarah were old , and well stricken in age : and it ceased to be with Sarah after the maner of women .
Therefore Sarah laughed within her selfe , saying , After I am waxed old , shall I haue pleasure , my lord being old also ?
And the LORD said vnto Abraham , Wherefore did Sarah laugh , saying ; Shall I of a surety beare a childe , which am old ?
Is any thing too hard for the LORD ? At the time appointed will I returne vnto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall haue a sonne .
Then Sarah denied , saying , I laughed not : for she was afraid . And he said , Nay , but thou diddest laugh .
¶ And the men rose vp from thence , and looked toward Sodome : and Abraham went with them , to bring them on the way .
And the LORD said , Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe ;
Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
For I know him , that hee will command his children , and his household after him , and they shall keepe the way of the LORD , to doe iustice and iudgement , that the LORD may bring vpon Abraham , that which hee hath spoken of him .
And the LORD said , Because the cry of Sodome and Gomorrah is great , and because their sinne is very grieuous :
I will goe downe now , and see whether they haue done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come vnto me : and if not , I will know .
And the men turned their faces from thence , and went toward Sodome : but Abraham stood yet before the LORD .
¶ And Abraham drew neere , and said , Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
Peraduenture there be fifty righteous within the citie ; wilt thou also destroy , and not spare the place for the fiftie righteous , that are therein ?
That be farre from thee , to do after this maner , to slay the righteous with the wicked , and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be farre from thee : Shall not the Iudge of all the earth doe right ?
And the LORD said , If I find in Sodom fiftie righteous , within the citie , then I will spare all the place for their sakes .
And Abraham answered , and said , Behold now , I haue taken vpon me to speake vnto the LORD , which am but dust and ashes .
Peraduenture there shall lacke fiue of the fiftie righteous : wilt thou destroy all the citie for lacke of fiue ? And he said , If I find there fourtie and fiue , I will not destroy it .
And hee spake vnto him yet againe , and said , Peraduenture there shall be fourtie found there : and he said , I will not doe it for fourties sake .
And he said vnto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speake : Peraduenture there shall thirtie bee found there . And he said , I will not doe it , if I find thirtie there .
And he said , Behold now , I haue taken vpon mee to speake vnto the Lord : Peraduenture there shall bee twenty found there . And he said , I will not destroy it for twenties sake .
And hee saide , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speake yet but this once : Peraduenture ten shall be found there . And he said , I will not destroy it for tennes sake .

And there came two Angels to Sodome at euen , and Lot sate in the gate of Sodome : and Lot seeing them , rose vp to meet them , and he bowed himselfe with his face toward the ground .
And he said , Beholde now my Lords , turne in , I pray you , into your seruants house , and tarie all night , and wash your feete , and ye shall rise vp early and goe on your wayes . And they said , Nay : but we wil abide in the street all night .
And he pressed vpon them greatly , and they turned in vnto him , and entred into his house : and he made them a feast , and did bake vnleauened bread , and they did eate .
¶ But before they lay downe , the men of the citie , euen the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and yong , all the people from euery quarter .
And they called vnto Lot , and said vnto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out vnto vs , that we may know them .
And Lot went out at the doore vnto them , & shut the doore after him ,
And said , I pray you , brethren , doe not so wickedly .
Behold now , I haue two daughters , which haue not knowen man ; let mee , I pray you , bring them out vnto you , and doe ye to them , as is good in your eyes : onely vnto these men do nothing : for therefore came they vnder the shadow of my roofe .
And they said , Stand backe . And they said againe , This one fellow came in to soiourne , and he will needs bee a Iudge : Now wil we deale worse with thee , then with them . And they pressed sore vpon the man , euen Lot , and came neere to breake the doore .
But the men put forth their hand , and pulled Lot into the house to them , and shut to the doore .
And they smote the men that were at the doore of the house , with blindnes , both small and great : so that they wearied themselues to finde the doore .
¶ And the men said vnto Lot , Hast thou here any besides ? sonne in law , and thy sonnes , and thy daughters , and whatsoeuer thou hast in the citie , bring them out of this place .
For we will destroy this place , because the crie of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD : and the LORD hath sent vs to destroy it .
And Lot went out , and spake vnto his sonnes in law , which married his daughters , and said , Up , get yee out of this place : for the LORD wil destroy this citie : but hee seemed as one that mocked , vnto his sonnes in law .
¶ And when the morning arose , then the Angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , & thy two daughters , which are here , lest thou be consumed in the iniquitie of the citie .
And while he lingred , the men laid hold vpon his hand , and vpon the hand of his wife , and vpon the hand of his two daughters , the LORD being mercifull vnto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the citie .
¶ And it came to passe , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Escape for thy life , looke not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plaine : escape to the mountaine , lest thou bee consumed .
And Lot said vnto them , Oh not so , my Lord .
Beholde now , thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed vnto me , in sauing my life , and I cannot escape to the mountaine , lest some euill take me , and I die .
Behold now , this citie is neere to flee vnto , and it is a litle one : Oh let me escape thither , ( is it not a litle one ? ) and my soule shall liue .
And he said vnto him , See , I haue accepted thee concerning this thing , that I will not ouerthrow this citie , for the which thou hast spoken .
Haste thee , escape thither : for I cannot doe any thing till thou bee come thither : therefore the name of the citie was called Zoar .
¶ The sunne was risen vpon the earth , when Lot entred into Zoar .
Then the LORD rained vpon Sodome & vpon Gomorrah , brimstone and fire , from the LORD out of heauen .
And he ouerthrew those cities , and all the plaine , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew vpon the ground .
¶ But his wife looked backe from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
¶ And Abraham gate vp earely in the morning , to the place , where hee stood before the LORD .
And he looked toward Sodome and Gomorrah , & toward all the land of the plaine , and beheld , and loe , the smoke of the countrey went vp as the smoke of a furnace .
¶ And it came to passe , when God destroyed the cities of the plaine , that God remembred Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the ouerthrow , when he ouerthrew the cities , in the which Lot dwelt .
¶ And Lot went vp out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountaine , and his two daughters with him : for hee feared to dwell in Zoar , and he dwelt in a caue , he and his two daughters .
And the first borne saide vnto the yonger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth , to come in vnto vs , after the maner of all the earth .
Come , let vs make our father drinke wine , and we will lye with him , that we may preserue seed of our father .
And they made their father drinke wine that night , & the first borne went in , and lay with her father : and he perceiued not , when shee lay downe , nor when she arose .
And it came to passe on the morrow , that the first borne said vnto the yonger , Behold , I lay yesternight with my father : let vs make him drinke wine this night also , and goe thou in , and lye with him , that we may preserue seed of our father .
And they made their father drinke wine that night also , and the yonger arose , and lay with him : and he perceiued not , when she lay downe , nor when she arose .
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with childe by their father .
And the first borne bare a sonne , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites vnto this day .

And Abraham iourneyed from thence , toward the South - Countrey , and dwelled betweene Cadesh and Shur , and soiourned in Gerar .
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister : And Abimelech King of Gerar sent , and tooke Sarah .
But God came to Abimelech in a dreame by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken : for shee is a mans wife .
But Abimelech had not come neere her : and he said , LORD , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
Said he not vnto me , She is my sister ? and she , euen she herselfe said , Hee is my brother : in the integritie of my heart , and innocencie of my hands haue I done this .
And God saide vnto him in a dreame , Yea , I know that thou didst this in the integritie of thy heart : for I also withheld thee from sinning against mee , therefore suffered I thee not to touch her .
Now therefore restore the man his wife : for he is a Prophet , and he shal pray for thee , and thou shalt liue : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are thine .
Therefore Abimelech rose earely in the morning , and called all his seruants , and told all these things in their eares : and the men were sore afraid .
Then Abimelech called Abraham , and said vnto him , What hast thou done vnto vs ? and what haue I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me , and on my kingdome a great sinne ? thou hast done deeds vnto mee that ought not to be done .
And Abimelech said vnto Abraham , What sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ?
And Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the feare of God is not in this place : and they will slay mee for my wiues sake .
And yet indeed shee is my sister : she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and shee became my wife .
And it came to passe when God caused me to wander from my fathers house , that I said vnto her , This is thy kindnesse which thou shalt shew vnto me ; at euery place whither wee shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
And Abimelech tooke sheepe and oxen , and men - seruants , and women seruants , and gaue them vnto Abraham , and restored him Sarah his wife .
And Abimelech said , Behold , my land is before thee ; dwel where it pleaseth thee .
And vnto Sarah hee said , Behold , I haue giuen thy brother a thousand pieces of siluer : behold , he is to thee a couering of the eyes , vnto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus shee was reproued .
¶ So Abraham prayed vnto God : and God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his maid - seruants , and they bare children .
<NON-VERSE>
And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said , and the LORD did vnto Sarah as he had spoken .
For Sarah conceiued , and bare Abraham a sonne in his old age , at the set time , of which God had spoken to him .
And Abraham called the name of his sonne , that was borne vnto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac . And Abraham circumcised his sonne Isaac , being eight dayes old , as God had commanded him .
And Abraham was an hundred yeeres old , when his sonne Isaac was borne vnto him .
¶ And Sarah said , God hath made me to laugh , so that all that heare , will laugh with me .
And she said , Who would haue said vnto Abraham , that Sarah should haue giuen children sucke ? for I haue borne him a sonne in his old age .
And the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast , the same day that Isaac was weaned .
¶ And Sarah saw the sonne of Hagar the Egyptian , which shee had borne vnto Abraham , mocking .
Wherfore she said vnto Abraham , Cast out this bond woman , and her sonne : for the sonne of this bond woman shall not be heire with my sonne , euen with Isaac .
And the thing was very grieuous in Abrahams sight , because of his sonne .
¶ And God said vnto Abraham , Let it not be grieuous in thy sight , because of the lad , and because of thy bond woman . In all that Sarah hath said vnto thee , hearken vnto her voice : for in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
And also , of the sonne of the bond woman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
And Abraham rose vp earely in the morning , and tooke bread , and a bottle of water , and gaue it vnto Hagar , ( putting it on her shoulder , ) and the child , and sent her away : and shee departed , and wandered in the wildernesse of Beer - sheba .
And the water was spent in the bottle , and shee cast the child vnder one of the shrubs .
And she went , and sate her downe ouer against him , a good way off , as it were a bow shoot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . And shee sate ouer against him , and lift vp her voice , and wept .
And God heard the voice of the lad , and the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heauen , and said vnto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ? feare not : for God hath heard the voice of the ladde , where he is .
Arise , lift vp the lad , and hold him in thine hand : for I will make him a great nation .
And God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water , and shee went , and filled the bottle with water , and gaue the lad drinke .
And God was with the lad , and he grew , and dwelt in the wildernesse , and became an archer .
And hee dwelt in the wildernesse of Paran : and his mother tooke him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
¶ And it came to passe at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chiefe captaine of his hoste spake vnto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest .
Now therefore sweare vnto mee here by God , that thou wilt not deale falsly with me , nor with my sonne , nor with my sonnes sonne : but according to the kindnesse that I haue done vnto thee , thou shalt doe vnto me , and to the land wherein thou hast soiourned .
And Abraham saide , I will sweare .
And Abraham reproued Abimelech , because of a well of water , which Abimelechs seruants had violently taken away .
And Abimelech saide , I wote not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard I of it , but to day .
And Abraham tooke sheepe and oxen , and gaue them vnto Abimelech : and both of them made a couenant . And Abraham set seuen ewe lambes of the flocke by themselues .
And Abimelech said vnto Abraham , What meane these seuen ewe lambes , which thou hast set by themselues ?
And he said , For these seuen ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witnesse vnto me , that I haue digged this well .
Wherefore he called that place , Beer - sheba : because there they sware both of them .
Thus they made a couenant at Beeer - sheba : then Abimelech rose vp , and Phichol the chiefe captaine of his hoste , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
¶ And Abraham planted a groue in Beer - sheba , and called there on the Name of the LORD , the euerlasting God .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe after these things , that God did tempt Abraham , and said vnto him , Abraham . And hee said , Beholde , heere I am .
And he said , Take now thy sonne , thine onely sonne Isaac , whom thou louest , and get thee into the land of Moriah : and offer him there for a burnt offering vpon one of the Mountaines which I will tell thee of .
¶ And Abraham rose vp earely in the morning , and sadled his asse , and tooke two of his yong men with him , and Isaac his sonne , and claue the wood for the burnt offering , and rose vp , and went vnto the place of which God had told him .
Then on the third day Abraham lift vp his eyes , and saw the place afarre off .
And Abraham said vnto his yong men , Abide you here with the asse , and I and the lad will goe yonder and worship , and come againe to you .
And Abraham tooke the wood of the burnt offering , and layd it vpon Isaac his sonne : and he tooke the fire in his hand , and a knife : and they went both of them together .
And Isaac spake vnto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my sonne . And hee said , Behold the fire and wood : but where is the lambe for a burnt offring ?
And Abraham said , My sonne , God will prouide himselfe a lambe for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
And they came to the place which God had tolde him of , and Abraham built an Altar there , and layd the wood in order , and bound Isaac his sonne , and layde him on the Altar vpon the wood .
And Abraham stretched foorth his hand , and tooke the knife to slay his sonne .
And the Angel of the LORD called vnto him out of heauen , and said , Abraham , Abraham . And he said , Here am I .
And he said , Lay not thine hand vpon the lad , neither do thou any thing vnto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withhelde thy sonne , thine onely sonne from mee .
And Abraham lifted vp his eyes , and looked , and beholde , behinde him a Ramme caught in a thicket by his hornes : And Abraham went and tooke the Ramme , and offered him vp for a burnt offering , in the stead of his sonne .
And Abraham called the name of that place Iehouah - ijreh , as it is said to this day , In the Mount of the LORD it shalbe seene .
¶ And the Angel of the LORD called vnto Abraham out of heauen the second time ,
And said , By my selfe haue I sworne , saith the LORD , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy sonne , thine onely sonne ,
That in blessing I will blesse thee , and in multiplying , I will multiply thy seed as the starres of the heauen , and as the sand which is vpon the sea shore , and thy seed shall possesse the gate of his enemies .
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed , because thou hast obeyed my voice .
And Bethuel begate Rebekah : these eight Milcah did beare to Nahor , Abrahams brother .
<NON-VERSE> And Sarah was an hundred and seuen and twenty yeeres olde : these were the yeeres of the life of Sarah .
And Sarah died in Kiriath arba , the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan : And Abraham came to mourne for Sarah , and to weepe for her .
¶ And Abraham stood vp from before his dead , & spake vnto the sonnes of Heth , saying ,
I am a stranger and a soiourner with you : giue me a possession of a burying place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
And the children of Heth answered Abraham , saying vnto him ,
Heare vs , my Lord , thou art a mightie Prince amongst vs : in the choise of our sepulchres bury thy dead : none of vs shall withhold from thee his sepulchre , but that thou mayest bury thy dead . And Abraham stood vp and bowed himselfe to the people of the land , euen to the children of Heth .
And hee communed with them , saying , if it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , heare me , and entreat for me to Ephron the sonne of Zohar :
That he may giue me the caue of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field : for as much money as it is worth he shall giue it mee , for a possession of a burying place amongst you .
And Ephron dwelt amongst the children of Heth . And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , euen of all that went in at the gates of his citie , saying ,
Nay , my lord , heare mee : the field giue I thee , and the caue that is therein , I giue it thee , in the presence of the sonnes of my people giue I it thee : bury thy dead .
And Abraham bowed downe himselfe before the people of the land .
And he spake vnto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land , saying , But if thou wilt giue it , I pray thee , heare mee : I will giue thee money for the field : take it of me , and I will bury my dead there .
And Ephron answered Abraham , saying vnto him ,
My lord , hearken vnto mee : the land is worth foure hundred shekels of siluer : what is that betwixt mee and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
And Abraham hearkened vnto Ephron , and Abraham weighed to Ephron the siluer , which he had named , in the audience of the sonnes of Heth , foure hundred shekels of siluer , currant money with the merchant .
¶ And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the fielde and the caue which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth , before all that went in at the gates of his Citie .
And after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the caue of the field of Machpelah , before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
<NON-VERSE>
And Abraham was olde and well stricken in age : And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things .
And Abraham said vnto his eldest seruant of his house , that ruled ouer all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand vnder my thigh :
And I will make thee sweare by the LORD the God of heauen , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife vnto my sonne of the daughters of the Canaanites amongst whom I dwell .
But thou shalt go vnto my countrey , and to my kinred , and take a wife vnto my sonne Isaac .
And the seruant said vnto him , Peraduenture the woman will not bee willing to follow mee vnto this land : must I needes bring thy sonne againe , vnto the land from whence thou camest ?
And Abraham said vnto him , Beware thou , that thou bring not my sonne thither againe .
¶ The LORD God of heauen which tooke mee from my fathers house , and from the land of my kindred , and which spake vnto mee , and that sware vnto me , saying , Unto thy seed will I giue this land , he shall send his Angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife vnto my sonne from thence .
And if the woman wil not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt bee cleare from this my othe : onely bring not my sonne thither againe .
And the seruant put his hand vnder the thigh of Abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter .
¶ And the seruant tooke ten camels , of the camels of his master , and departed , ( for all the goods of his master were in his hand ) and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , vnto the citie of Nahor .
And he made his camels to kneele downe without the citie , by a well of water , at the time of the euening , euen the time that women goe out to draw water .
And he said , O LORD , God of my master Abraham , I pray thee send me good speed this day , and shew kindnesse vnto my master Abraham .
Behold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the Citie come out to draw water :
And let it come to passe , that the damsell to whom I shall say , Let downe thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drinke , and she shall say , Drinke , and I will giue thy camels drinke also ; let the same be shee that thou hast appointed for thy seruant Isaac : and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindnesse vnto my master .
¶ And it came to passe before hee had done speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was borne to Bethuel , sonne of Milcah , the wife of Nahor Abrahams brother , with her pitcher vpon her shoulder .
And the damsell was very faire to looke vpon , a virgine , neither had any man knowen her ; and shee went downe to the wel , and filled her pitcher , and came vp .
And the seruant ranne to meete her , and said , Let mee ( I pray thee ) drinke a little water of thy pitcher .
And she said , Drinke , my lord : and she hasted , and let downe her pitcher vpon her hand , and gaue him drinke .
And when shee had done giuing him drinke , she said , I will draw water for thy camels also , vntill they haue done drinking .
And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ranne againe vnto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
And the man wondering at her , helde his peace , to wit , whether the LORD had made his iourney prosperous , or not .
And it came to passe as the camels had done drinking , that the man tooke a golden eare - ring , of halfe a shekel weight , & two bracelets for her handes , of ten shekels weight of gold ,
And said , whose daughter art thou ? tell mee , I pray thee : is there roome in thy fathers house for vs to lodge in ?
And she said vnto him , I am the daughter of Bethuel the sonne of Milcah , which she bare vnto Nahor :
She said moreouer vnto him , We haue both straw & prouender ynough , and roome to lodge in .
And the man bowed downe his head , and worshipped the LORD .
And hee saide , Blessed bee the LORD God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy , and his trueth : I being in the way , the LORD led me to the house of my masters brethren .
And the damsell ranne , and told them of her mothers house , these things .
¶ And Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ranne out vnto the man , vnto the well .
And it came to passe when he saw the eare - ring , and bracelets vpon his sisters hands , and when hee heard the wordes of Rebekah his sister , saying , Thus spake the man vnto me , that he came vnto the man ; and behold , hee stood by the camels , at the well .
And he said , Come in , thou blessed of the LORD , wherefore standest thou without ? for I haue prepared the house , and roome for the camels .
¶ And the man came into the house : and he vngirded his camels , and gaue straw and prouender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the mens feet that were with him .
And there was set meat before him to eate : but he said , I will not eate , vntill I haue tolde mine errand . And hee said , Speake on .
And he said , I am Abrahams seruant .
And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly , and hee is become great : and hee hath giuen him flocks , and heards , and siluer , and gold , and men seruants , and mayd seruants , and camels , and asses .
And Sarah my masters wife bare a sonne to my master when shee was old : and vnto him hath hee giuen all that he hath .
And my master made me sweare , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my sonne , of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell :
But thou shalt goe vnto my fathers house , and to my kinred , and take a wife vnto my sonne .
And I said vnto my master , Peraduenture the woman will not followe me .
And hee saide vnto me , The LORD , before whom I walke , will send his Angel with thee , and prosper thy way : and thou shalt take a wife for my sonne , of my kinred , and of my fathers house .
Then shalt thou bee cleare from this my oath , when thou commest to my kinred , and if they giue not thee one , thou shalt be cleare from my oath .
And I came this day vnto the well , and said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , if now thou doe prosper my way , which I goe :
Behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to passe , that when the virgine commeth foorth to draw water , and I say to her , Giue me , I pray thee , a litle water of thy pitcher to drinke ;
And she say to me , Both drinke thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman , whom the LORD hath appointed out for my masters sonne .
And before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth , with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went downe vnto the well , and drew water : and I said vnto her , Let me drinke , I pray thee .
And she made haste , & let downe her pitcher from her shoulder , and saide , Drinke , and I will giue thy camels drinke also : so I dranke , and she made the camels drinke also .
And I asked her , and said , whose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahors sonne , whom Milcah bare vnto him : and I put the earering vpon her face , and the bracelets vpon her hands .
And I bowed downe my head , and worshipped the LORD , and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham , which had led mee in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter vnto his sonne .
And now if you wil deale kindly and truely with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me , that I may turne to the right hand , or to the left .
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said , The thing proceedeth from the LORD : we cannot speake vnto thee bad or good .
Behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and goe , and let her be thy masters sonnes wife , as the LORD hath spoken .
And it came to passe , that when Abrahams seruant heard their words , he worshipped the LORD , bowing himselfe to the earth .
And the seruant brought foorth iewels of siluer , and iewels of gold , and raiment , and gaue them to Rebekah : He gaue also to her brother , and to her mother precious things .
And they did eate and drinke , he and the men that were with him , and taried all night , and they rose vp in the morning , and he said , Send me away vnto my master .
And her brother and her mother said , Let the damsell abide with vs a few dayes , at the least ten ; after that , she shall goe .
And he said vnto them , Hinder me not , seeing the LORD hath prospered my way : send me away , that I may goe to my master .
And they said , wee will call the Damsell , and enquire at her mouth .
And they called Rebekah , and said vnto her , Wilt thou go with this man ? and she said , I will goe .
And they sent away Rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and Abrahams seruant , and his men .
And they blessed Rebekah , and said vnto her , Thou art our sister , bee thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possesse the gate of those which hate them .
¶ And Rebekah arose , and her damsels , & they rode vpon the camels , and followed the man : and the seruant tooke Rebekah , and went his way .
And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai - roi , for he dwelt in the South countrey .
And Isaac went out , to meditate in the field , at the euentide : and hee lift vp his eyes , and saw , and behold , the camels were comming .
And Rebekah lift vp her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she lighted off the camel .
For she had said vnto the seruant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet vs ? and the seruant had said , It is my master : therefore shee tooke a vaile and couered her selfe .
And the seruant tolde Isaac all things that he had done .

Then againe Abraham tooke a wife , & her name was Keturah .
And shee bare him Zimran , and Iokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah .
And Iokshan begat Sheba , and Dedan . And the sonnes of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim .
Then Abraham gaue vp the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of yeeres , and was gathered to his people .
And his sonnes Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the caue of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the sonne of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ;
The field which Abraham purchased of the sonnes of Heth : there was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
¶ And it came to passe after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his sonne Isaac , and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai - roi .
¶ Now these are the generations of Ishmael Abrahams sonne , whom Hagar the Egyptian Sarahs handmayd , bare vnto Abraham :
And these are the names of the sonnes of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations ; The first borne of Ishmael , Nebaioth , and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam , And Mishma , and Dumah , and Massa ,
Hadar , and Tema , Ietur , Naphish , and Kedemah .
These are the sonnes of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their townes and by their castels ; twelue princes according to their nations .
And these are the yeeres of the life of Ishmael ; an hundred and thirty and seuen yeeres : and he gaue vp the ghost and died , and was gathered vnto his people .
And they dwelt from Hauilah vnto Shur , that is before Egypt , as thou goest towards Assyria : and hee died in the presence of all his brethren .
¶ And these are the generations of Isaac , Abrahams sonne : Abraham begate Isaac .
And Isaac was fortie yeeres old when hee tooke Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife , because she was barren : and the LORD was intreated of him , and Rebekah his wife conceiued .
And the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? and shee went to enquire of the LORD .
And the LORD said vnto her , Two nations are in thy wombe , and two maner of people shall be separated from thy bowels : and the one people shalbe stronger then the other people : and the elder shall serue the yonger .
¶ And when her dayes to be deliuered were fulfilled , behold , there were twinnes in her wombe .
And the first came out red , all ouer like an hairy garment : and they called his name , Esau .
And after that came his brother out , and his hand tooke holde on Esaus heele ; and his name was called Iacob : and Isaac was threescore yeres old , when shee bare them .
And the boyes grew ; and Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the fielde : and Iacob was a plaine man , dwelling in tents .
And Isaac loued Esau , because he did eate of his venison : but Rebekah loued Iacob .
¶ And Iacob sod pottage : and Esau came from the field , and hee was faint .
And Esau said to Iacob , Feed me , I pray thee , with that same red pottage : for I am faint ; therefore was his name called Edom .
And Iacob said , Sell me this day thy birthright .
And Esau said , Behold , I am at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright doe to me ?
And Iacob said , Sweare to mee this day : and he sware to him : and he sold his birthright vnto Iacob .

And there was a famine in the land , besides the first famine that was in the dayes of Abraham . And Isaac went vnto Abimelech King of the Philistims , vnto Gerar .
And the LORD appeared vnto him and said , Goe not downe into Egypt ; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of .
Soiourne in this land , and I wil be with thee , and will blesse thee : for vnto thee , and vnto thy seed I will giue all these countreys , and I wil performe the othe , which I sware vnto Abraham thy father .
And I wil make thy seed to multiply as the starres of heauen , and will giue vnto thy seed all these countreys : and in thy Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed :
Because that Abraham obeyed my voyce , and kept my charge , my Commandements , my Statutes and my Lawes .
¶ And Isaac dwelt in Gerar .
And the men of the place asked him of his wife : and he said , She is my sister : for he feared to say , She is my wife ; lest , said he , the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah , because shee was faire to looke vpon .
And it came to passe when he had bene there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistims looked out at a window , and saw , and behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
And Abimelech called Isaac and said , Behold , of a suretie she is thy wife : and how saidst thou , She is my sister ? And Isaac said vnto him , Because I said , Lest I die for her .
And Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done vnto vs ? one of the people might lightly haue lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest haue brought guiltinesse vpon vs .
And Abimelech charged all his people , saying , Hee that toucheth this man or his wife , shall surely bee put to death .
For he had possession of flocks , and possession of heards , and great store of seruants , and the Philistims enuied him .
For all the wels which his fathers seruants had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father , the Philistims had stopped them , & filled them with earth .
And Abimelech said vnto Isaac , Goe from vs : for thou art much mightier then we .
¶ And Isaac departed thence , and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar , and dwelt there .
And Isaac digged againe the wels of water , which they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father : for the Philistims had stopped them after the death of Abraham , and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
And Isaacs seruants digged in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
And the heardmen of Gerar did striue with Isaacs heardmen , saying , The water is ours ; and hee called the name of the well , Esek , because they stroue with him .
And they digged another well , and stroue for that also : and hee called the name of it , Sitnah .
And he remoued from thence , and digged another well , and for that they stroue not : and he called the name of it Rehoboth : and he said , For now the LORD hath made roome for vs , and we shall be fruitfull in the land .
And he went vp from thence to Beer - sheba .
And the LORD appeared vnto him the same night , and saide , I am the God of Abraham thy father : feare not , for I am with thee , and will blesse thee , and multiply thy seede , for my seruant Abrahams sake .
And he builded an altar there , and called vpon the name of the LORD , and pitched his tent there : and there Isaacs seruants digged a well .
¶ Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar , and Ahuzzath one of his friends , and Phichol the chiefe captaine of his armie .
And Isaac saide vnto them , Wherefore come ye to me , seeing ye hate me , and haue sent me away from you ?
And they said , we saw certainly that the LORD was with thee : and wee said , Let there be now an othe betwixt vs , euen betwixt vs and thee , and let vs make a couenant with thee ,
That thou wilt doe vs no hurt , as we haue not touched thee , and as we haue done vnto thee nothing but good , and haue sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
And he made them a feast , and they did eate and drinke .
And they rose vp betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
And it came to passe the same day , that Isaacs seruants came , and tolde him concerning the well which they had digged , and said vnto him , we haue found water .
And he called it Shebah : therefore the name of the citie is Beer - sheba vnto this day .
¶ And Esau was forty yeeres old , when he tooke to wife Iudith , the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite :
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dimme , so that he could not see , hee called Esau his eldest son , and said vnto him , My sonne . And hee said vnto him , Behold , here am I .
And he said , Behold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death .
Now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiuer , and thy bow , and goe out to the field , and take mee some venison .
And make me sauoury meat , such as I loue , and bring it to mee , that I may eate , that my soule may blesse thee before I die .
And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his sonne : and Esau went to the fielde to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
¶ And Rebekah spake vnto Iacob her sonne , saying , Behold , I heard thy father speake vnto Esau thy brother , saying ,
Bring me venison , and make mee sauoury meat , that I may eate , and blesse thee before the LORD , before my death .
Now therefore , my sonne , obey my voyce , according to that which I command thee .
Goe now to the flocke , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goates , and I will make them sauoury meat for thy father , such as he loueth .
And thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eate , and that he may blesse thee , before his death .
And Iacob said to Rebekah his mother , Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man .
My father peraduenture will feele me , and I shall seeme to him as a deceiuer , and I shall bring a curse vpon me , and not a blessing .
And his mother said vnto him , Upon me be thy curse , my sonne : onely obey my voice , and go fetch me them .
And hee went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother , and his mother made sauoury meat , such as his father loued .
And Rebekah tooke goodly raiment of her eldest sonne Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them vpon Iacob her yonger sonne :
And shee put the skinnes of the kids of the goats vpon his hands , and vpon the smooth of his necke .
And she gaue the sauoury meate , and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her sonne Iacob .
¶ And he came vnto his father , and said , My father : And he said , Here am I : who art thou , my sonne ?
And Iacob said vnto his father , I am Esau , thy first borne ; I haue done according as thou badest mee : arise , I pray thee , sit , and eate of my venison , that thy soule may blesse me .
And Isaac said vnto his sonne , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my sonne ? And he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
And Isaac saide vnto Iacob , Come neere , I pray thee , that I may feele thee , my sonne , whether thou bee my very sonne Esau , or not .
And Iacob went neere vnto Isaac his father : and hee felt him , and said , The voyce is Iacobs voyce , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
And he discerned him not , because his hands were hairie , as his brother Esaus hands : So he blessed him .
And he said , Art thou my very sonne Esau ? and he said , I am .
And he said , Bring it neere to me , and I will eate of my sonnes venison , that my soule may blesse thee : and hee brought it neere to him , and he did eate : and he brought him wine , & he dranke .
And his father Isaac saide vnto him , Come neere now , and kisse me , my sonne .
And hee came neere , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my sonne is as the smell of a field , which the LORD hath blessed .
Therefore God giue thee of the dew of heauen , and the fatnesse of the earth , and plenty of corne and wine .
Let people serue thee , and nations bow downe to thee : bee lord ouer thy brethren , & let thy mothers sonnes bow downe to thee : Cursed bee euery one that curseth thee , and blessed be hee that blesseth thee .
¶ And it came to passe , as soone as Isaac had made an ende of blessing Iacob , and Iacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
And hee also had made sauoury meate , and brought it vnto his father , and said vnto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his sonnes venison , that thy soule may blesse me .
And Isaac his father said vnto him , Who art thou ? and he said , I am thy sonne , thy first borne Esau .
And Isaac trembled very exceedingly , and said , Who ? Where is he that hath taken venison , and brought it me , and I haue eaten of all before thou camest , and haue blessed him ? yea and he shalbe blessed .
And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said vnto his father , Blesse mee , euen me also , O my father .
And hee said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away thy blessing .
And he said , Is not he rightly naned Iacob ? for he hath supplanted me these two times : hee tooke away my birthright , and behold , now he hath taken away my blessing : and hee said , Hast thou not reserued a blessing for mee ?
And Isaac answered and saide vnto Esau , Behold , I haue made him thy lord , and all his brethren haue I giuen to him for seruants : and with corne and wine haue I susteined him : and what shall I doe now vnto thee , my sonne ?
And Esau said vnto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? blesse mee , euen mee also , O my father . And Esau lift vp his voyce , and wept .
And Isaac his father answered , and said vnto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatnesse of the earth , and of the dew of heauen from aboue .
And by thy sword shalt thou liue , and shalt serue thy brother : and it shall come to passe when thou shalt haue the dominion , that thou shalt breake his yoke from off thy necke .
¶ And Esau hated Iacob , because of the blessing , wherewith his father blessed him : and Esau said in his heart , The dayes of mourning for my father are at hand ; then will I slay my brother Iacob .
And these words of Esau her elder sonne were told to Rebekah : And shee sent and called Iacob her yonger sonne , and said vnto him , Behold , thy brother Esau , as touching thee , doeth comfort himselfe , purposing to kill thee .
Now therefore my sonne , obey my voice : and arise , flee thou to Laban my brother , to Haran .
And tary with him a few dayes , vntill thy brothers furie turne away ;
Untill thy brothers anger turne away from thee , and hee forget that , which thou hast done to him : then I will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should I be depriued also of you both in one day ?
<NON-VERSE>
And Isaac called Iacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and saide vnto him , Thou shalt not take a wife , of the daughters of Canaan .
Arise , goe to Padan Aram , to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father , and take thee a wife from thence , of the daughters of Laban thy mothers brother .
And God Almighty blesse thee , and make thee fruitfull , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people :
And giue thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee and to thy seede with thee , that thou mayest inherit the lande wherein thou art a stranger , which God gaue vnto Abraham .
And Isaac sent away Iacob , and hee went to Padan - Aram vnto Laban , sonne of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Iacobs and Esaus mother .
¶ When Esau sawe that Isaac had blessed Iacob , and sent him away to Padan - Aram , to take him a wife from thence ; and that as he blessed him , he gaue him a charge , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan ;
And that Iacob obeyed his father , and his mother , and was gone to Padan - Aram ;
And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father .
Then went Esau vnto Ishmael , and tooke vnto the wiues which hee had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams sonne , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
¶ And Iacob went out from Beer - sheba , and went toward Haran .
And hee lighted vpon a certaine place , and taried there all night , because the sunne was set : and hee tooke of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillowes , and lay downe in that place to sleepe .
And he dreamed , and beholde , a ladder set vp on the earth , and the top of it reached to heauen : and beholde the Angels of God ascending and descending on it .
And behold , the LORD stood aboue it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I giue it , and to thy seede .
And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the West , and to the East , and to the North , and to the South : and in thee , and in thy seed , shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
And behold , I am with thee , and will keepe thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee againe into this land : for I will not leaue thee , vntill I haue done that which I haue spoken to thee of .
¶ And Iacob awaked out of his sleepe , and he said , Surely the LORD is in this place , and I knew it not .
And he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ? this is none other , but the house of God , and this is the gate of heauen .
And Iacob rose vp earely in the morning , and tooke the stone that hee had put for his pillowes , and set it vp for a pillar , and powred oile vpon the top of it .
And hee called the name of that place Beth - el : but the name of that citie was called Luz , at the first .
And Iacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keepe me in this way that I goe , and will giue me bread to eate , and raiment to put on ,
So that I come againe to my fathers house in peace : then shall the LORD be my God .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Iacob went on his iourney , and came into the land of the people of the East .
And he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and loe , there were three flocks of sheepe lying by it : for out of that wel they watered the flocks : and a great stone was vpon the welles mouth .
And thither were all the flockes gathered , and they rolled the stone from the wels mouth , & watered the sheepe , and put the stone againe vpon the wels mouth in his place .
And Iacob said vnto them , My brethren , whence be ye ? and they saide , Of Haran are we .
And he said vnto them , Know ye Laban the sonne of Nahor ? And they sayde , We knowe him .
And he said vnto them , Is hee well ? and they said , He is well : and behold , Rachel his daughter commeth with the sheepe .
And hee said , Loe , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattell should be gathered together : water yee the sheepe , and goe and feed them .
And they said , We cannot , vntill all the flockes bee gathered together , and till they rolle the stone from the welles mouth : then wee water the sheepe .
¶ And while hee yet spake with them , Rachel came with her fathers sheepe : for she kept them .
And it came to passe , when Iacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother , and the sheepe of Laban his mothers brother ; that Iacob went neere , and rolled the stone from the wels mouth , and watered the flocke of Laban his mothers brother .
And Iacob kissed Rachel , and lifted vp his voyce , and wept .
And Iacob told Rachel , that hee was her fathers brother , and that hee was Rebekahs sonne : and she ranne , and told her father .
¶ And Laban said vnto Iacob , Because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serue me for nought ? tell me , what shall thy wages be ?
And Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the yonger was Rachel .
Leah was tender eyed : but Rachel was beautiful and well fauoured .
And Iacob loued Rachel , and said , I will serue thee seuen yeeres for Rachel thy yonger daughter .
And Laban said , It is better that I giue her to thee , then that I should giue her to another man : abide with mee .
And Iacob serued seuen yeeres for Rachel : and they seemed vnto him but a few dayes , for the loue hee had to her .
¶ And Iacob said vnto Laban , Giue me my wife ( for my dayes are fulfilled ) that I may goe in vnto her .
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
And it came to passe in the euening , that he tooke Leah his daughter , and brought her to him , and he went in vnto her .
And Laban gaue vnto his daughter Leah , Zilpah his mayde , for a handmayd .
And it came to passe , that in the morning , behold it was Leah : and he said to Laban , What is this thou hast done vnto mee ? did not I serue with thee for Rachel ? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ?
And Laban said , It must not be so done in our countrey , to giue the yonger , before the first borne .
And Laban gaue to Rachel his daughter , Bilhah his handmayd , to be her mayd .
And hee went in also vnto Rachel , and he loued also Rachel more then Leah , and serued with him yet seuen other yeeres .
¶ And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated , hee opened her wombe : but Rachel was barren .
And Leah conceiued and bare a sonne , and shee called his name Reuben : for she said , Surely , the LORD hath looked vpon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will loue me .
And shee conceiued againe , and bare a sonne , and saide , Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated , hee hath therefore giuen mee this sonne also , and she called his name Simeon .
And shee conceiued againe , and bare a sonne , and said , Now this time will my husband be ioyned vnto me , because I haue borne him three sonnes : therefore was his name called Leui .
<NON-VERSE>
And when Rachel saw that shee bare Iacob no children , Rachel enuied her sister , and said vnto Iacob , Giue mee children , or els I die .
And Iacobs anger was kindled against Rachel , and he said , Am I in Gods stead , who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the wombe ?
And she said , Behold my mayde Bilhah : goe in vnto her , and she shall beare vpon my knees , that I may also have children by her .
And shee gaue him Bilhah her handmayd to wife : and Iacob went in vnto her .
And Bilhah conceiued and bare Iacob a sonne .
And Rachel said , God hath iudged me , and hath also heard my voyce , and hath giuen me a sonne ; therefore called she his name Dan .
And Bilhah Rachels mayd conceiued againe , and bare Iacob a second sonne .
And Rachel saide , With great wrastlings haue I wrastled with my sister , and I haue preuailed : and she called his name Naphtali .
When Leah saw that she had left bearing , shee tooke Zilpah her mayde , and gaue her Iacob to wife .
And Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iacob a sonne .
And Leah said , A troupe commeth : and she called his name Gad .
And Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iacob a second sonne .
And Leah said , Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name Asher .
¶ And Reuben went in the dayes of wheat haruest , & found Mandrakes in the field , and brought them vnto his mother Leah . Then Rachel saide to Leah , Giue me , I pray thee , of thy sonnes Mandrakes .
And shee said vnto her , Is it a small matter , that thou hast taken my husband ? and wouldst thou take away my sonnes Mandrakes also ? and Rachel said , Therefore hee shall lye with thee to night , for thy sonnes Mandrakes .
And Iacob came out of the field in the euening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in vnto mee : for surely I haue hired thee with my sonnes Mandrakes . And hee lay with her that night .
And God hearkened vnto Leah , and she conceiued , and bare Iacob the fift sonne .
And Leah said , God hath giuen mee my hire , because I haue giuen my mayden to my husband : and she called his name Issachar .
And Leah conceiued againe , and bare Iacob the sixth sonne .
And Leah said , God hath endued me with a good dowry : Now will my husband dwel with me , because I haue borne him sixe sonnes : and shee called his name Zebulun .
And afterwardes shee bare a daughter , and called her name Dinah .
¶ And God remembred Rachel , and God hearkened to her , and opened her wombe .
And shee conceiued and bare a sonne , and said ; God hath taken away my reproch :
And shee called his name Ioseph , and saide , The LORD shall adde to me another sonne .
¶ And it came to passe when Rachel had borne Ioseph , that Iacob said vnto Laban , Send me away , that I may goe vnto mine owne place , and to my countrey .
Giue mee my wiues and my children , for whom I haue serued thee , and let me goe : for thou knowest my seruice which I haue done thee .
And Laban said vnto him , I pray thee , if I haue found fauour in thine eyes , tary : for I haue learned by experience , that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
And he said , Appoint me thy wages , and I will giue it .
And hee said vnto him , Thou knowest how I haue serued thee , and how thy cattell was with me .
For it was little which thou hadst before I came ; and it is now increased vnto a multitude ; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my comming : and now when shall I prouide for mine owne house also ?
And hee said , what shall I giue thee ? and Iacob said , Thou shalt not giue me any thing ; if thou wilt doe this thing for mee , I will againe feed and keepe thy flocke .
I will passe through all thy flocke to day , remoouing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattell : and all the browne cattell among the sheepe , and the spotted and speckled among the goates , and of such shalbe my hire .
So shall my righteousnesse answere for mee in time to come , when it shall come for my hire , before thy face : euery one that is not speckled and spotted amongst the goates , and browne amongst the sheepe , that shalbe counted stollen with me .
And Laban saide , Beholde , I would it might bee according to thy word .
And he remoued that day the hee goates that were ring - straked , and spotted , and all the shee goats that were speckled and spotted , and euery one that had some white in it , and all the browne amongst the sheepe , and gaue them into the hand of his sonnes .
And hee set three dayes iourney betwixt himselfe and Iacob : and Iacob fed the rest of Labans flocks .
And the flockes conceiued before the rods , and brought forth cattell ringstraked , speckled and spotted .
And Iacob did separate the lambes , and set the faces of the flockes toward the ring - straked , and all the browne in the flocke of Laban : and he put his owne flocks by themselues , and put them not vnto Labans cattell .
And it came to passe whensoeuer the stronger cattell did conceiue , that Iacob layd the rods before the eyes of the cattell in the gutters , that they might conceiue among the rods .
But when the cattel were feeble , hee put them not in : so the feebler were Labans , and the stronger Iacobs .
<NON-VERSE>
And he heard the words of Labans sonnes , saying , Iacob hath taken away all that was our fathers ; and of that which was of our fathers , hath hee gotten all this glory .
And Iacob behelde the countenance of Laban , and behold , it was not toward him as before .
And the LORD said vnto Iacob , Returne vnto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and I wil be with thee .
And Iacob sent and called Rachel and Leah , to the field vnto his flocke ,
And said vnto them , I see your fathers countenance , that it is not toward mee as before : but the God of my father hath bene with me .
And yee know , that with all my power I haue serued your father .
And your father hath deceiued mee , and changed my wages ten times : but God suffered him not to hurt me .
If hee said thus , The speckled shall be thy wages , then all the cattell bare speckled : and if he said thus , The ring - straked shalbe thy hire , then bare all the cattell ring - straked .
Thus God hath taken away the cattell of your father , and giuen them to mee .
And it came to passe at the time that the cattell conceiued , that I lifted vp mine eyes and saw in a dreame , and behold , the rammes which leaped vpon the cattell were ring - straked , speckled and grisled .
And the Angel of God spake vnto me in a dreame , saying , Iacob ; And I said , Here am I .
And hee said , Lift vp now thine eyes , and see , all the rammes which leape vpon the cattell are ring - straked , speckled and grisled : for I haue seene all that Laban doeth vnto thee .
I am the God of Bethel , where thou annoyntedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow vnto mee : now arise , get thee out from this land , and returne vnto the land of thy kindred .
And Rachel and Leah answered , and said vnto him ; Is there yet any portion or inheritance for vs in our fathers house ?
Are we not counted of him strangers ? for he hath sold vs , and hath quite deuoured also our money .
For all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our childrens : now then whatsoeuer God hath said vnto thee , doe .
¶ Then Iacob rose vp , and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels .
And he caried away all his cattell , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattell of his getting , which hee had gotten in Padan Aram , for to goe to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
And Laban went to sheare his sheepe : and Rachel had stollen the Images that were her fathers .
And Iacob stale away vnawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
So hee fled with all that hee had , and he rose vp and passed ouer the Riuer , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
And it was tolde Laban on the third day , that Iacob was fled .
And hee tooke his brethren with him , and pursued after him seuen dayes iourney , and they ouertooke him in the mount Gilead .
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dreame by night , and saide vnto him , Take heed that thou speake not to Iacob either good or bad .
¶ Then Laban ouertooke Iacob . Now Iacob had pitched his tent in the mount : and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead .
And Laban said to Iacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast stollen away vnawares to me , and caried away my daughters , as captiues taken with the sword ?
Wherefore didst thou flie away secretly , and steale away from me , and didst not tell mee ? that I might haue sent thee away with mirth , and with songs , with tabret , and with harpe ,
And hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
It is in the power of my hand to doe you hurt : but the God of your father spake vnto mee yesternight , saying , Take thou heed , that thou speake not to Iacob either good or bad .
And now though thou wouldest needes bee gone , because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house ; yet wherefore hast thou stollen my gods ?
And Iacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peraduenture thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
With whomsoeuer thou findest thy gods , let him not liue : before our brethren discerne thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee : for Iacob knew not that Rachel had stollen them .
And Laban went into Iacobs tent , and into Leahs tent , and into the two maid seruants tents : but he found them not . Then went he out of Leahs tent , and entred into Rachels tent .
Now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the camels furniture , and sate vpon them : and Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
And shee said to her father , Let it not displease my lord , that I cannot rise vp before thee ; for the custome of women is vpon mee : and he searched , but found not the images .
¶ And Iacob was wroth , and chode with Laban : and Iacob answered and said to Laban , what is my trespasse ? what is my sinne , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuffe , what hast thou found of all thy houshold stuffe ? set it here before my brethren , and thy brethren , that they may iudge betwixt vs both .
Thus I was in the day , the drought consumed mee , and the frost by night , aud my sleep departed from mine eyes .
Thus have I bene twentie yeres in thy house : I serued thee fourteene yeeres for thy two daughters , and sixe yeres for thy cattel ; and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
Except the God of my father , the God of Abraham , and the feare of Isaac had bin with me , surely thou hadst sent me away now emptie : God hath seene mine affliction , and the labour of my hands , & rebuked thee yesternight .
¶ And Laban answered and said vnto Iacob , These daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and these cattell are my cattell , and all that thou seest , is mine : and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters , or vnto their children which they haue borne ?
Now therefore come thou , let vs make a couenant , I and thou : and let it be for a witnesse betweene me and thee .
And Iacob tooke a stone , and set it vp for a pillar .
And Iacob saide vnto his brethren , Gather stones : and they tooke stones , and made an heape , and they did eate there vpon the heape .
And Laban called it Iegar - Sahadutha : but Iacob called it Galeed .
And Laban said , This heape is a witnesse betweene mee and thee this day . Therefore was the name of it called Galeed ,
And Mizpah : for he said , The LORD watch betweene me and thee when we are absent one from another .
If thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wiues beside my daughters , no man is with vs ; See , God is witnesse betwixt mee and thee .
And Laban said to Iacob , Behold this heape , and behold this pillar , which I haue cast betwixt me and thee .
This heape be witnesse , and this pillar be witnesse , that I will not passe ouer this heape to thee , and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape , and this pillar vnto me , for harme .
The God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , iudge betwixt vs . And Iacob sware by the feare of his father Isaac .
Then Iacob offred sacrifice vpon the mount , and called his brethren to eate bread , and they did eate bread , and taried all night in the mount .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iacob went on his way , and the Angels of God met him .
And when Iacob saw them , he said , This is Gods hoste : and hee called the name of that place Mahanaim .
And Iacob sent messengers before him , to Esau his brother , vnto the land of Seir , the countrey of Edom .
And he commaunded them , saying , Thus shall ye speake vnto my lord Esau , Thy seruant Iacob saith thus , I haue soiourned with Laban , and stayed there vntill now .
And I haue oxen , and asses , flockes , and men seruants and women seruants : and I haue sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in thy sight .
¶ And the messengers returned to Iacob , saying , Wee came to thy brother Esau , and also he commeth to meet thee , and foure hundred men with him .
Then Iacob was greatly afraid , and distressed , and he diuided the people that was with him , and the flockes , and herdes , and the camels into two bands ,
And said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left , shall escape .
¶ And Iacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst vnto me , Returne vnto thy countrey , and to thy kinred , and I will deale well with thee :
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the trueth , which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant : for with my staffe I passed ouer this Iordan , and now I am become two bands .
Deliuer me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I feare him , lest he will come , and smite me , and the mother with the children .
And thou saidst , I will surely doe thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbred for multitude .
¶ And he lodged there that same night , and tooke of that which came to his hand , a present for Esau his brother :
Two hundred shee goats , and twentie hee goats , two hundred ewes , and twentie rammes ,
Thirtie milch camels with their colts , fortie kine , and ten bulles , twenty shee ashes , and ten foales .
And hee deliuered them into the hand of his seruants , euery droue by themselues , and said vnto his seruants , Passe ouer before me , and put a space betwixt droue and droue .
And he commanded the formost , saying , When Esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose are these before thee ?
Then thou shalt say , They be thy seruant Iacobs : it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau : and behold also , he is behind vs .
And so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droues , saying , On this maner shal you speake vnto Esau , when you find him .
And say ye moreouer , Beholde , thy seruant Iacob is behind vs : for he said , I will appease him with the present that goeth before me , and afterward I will see his face ; peraduenture he will accept of me .
So went the present ouer before him : and himselfe lodged that night in the company .
And hee rose vp that night , and tooke his two wiues , and his two women seruants , and his eleuen sonnes , and passed ouer the foord Iabbok .
And he tooke them , and sent them ouer the brooke , and sent ouer that hee had .
¶ And Iacob was left alone : and there wrestled a man with him , vntill the breaking of the day .
And when he saw , that he preuailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh : and the hollow of Iacobs thigh was out of ioynt , as hee wrestled with him .
And he said , Let me goe , for the day breaketh : and he said , I will not let thee goe , except thou blesse me .
And he said vnto him , what is thy name ? and he said , Iacob .
And he said , Thy name shall be called no more Iacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God , and with men , and hast preuailed .
And Iacob asked him , and saide , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name : and he said , wherefore is it , that thou doest aske after my name ? and he blessed him there .
And Iacob called the name of the place Peniel : for I haue seene God face to face , and my life is preserued .
And as he passed ouer Penuel , the sunne rose vpon him , and he halted vpon his thigh .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iacob lifted vp his eyes , and looked , and behold , Esau came , and with him foure hundreth men : and hee diuided the children vnto Leah , and vnto Rachel , and vnto the two handmaids .
And he put the handmaides , and their chidren foremost , and Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Ioseph hindermost .
And hee passed ouer before them , and bowed himselfe to the ground seuen times , vntill hee came neere to his brother .
And Esau ran to meete him , and imbraced him , and fell on his necke , and kissed him , and they wept .
And he lift vp his eyes , and sawe the women , and the children , and said , who are those with thee ? And he said , The children which God hath graciously giuen thy seruant .
Then the handmaidens came neere ; they and their children , and they bowed themselues .
And Leah also with her children came neere , and bowed themselues : and after came Ioseph neere and Rachel , and they bowed themselues .
And he said , What meanest thou by all this droue , which I met ? And he said , These are to find grace in the sight of my lord .
And Esau said , I haue enough : my brother , keepe that thou hast vnto thy selfe .
And Iacob saide , Nay , I pray thee : if now I haue found grace in thy sight , then receiue my present at my hand : for therefore I haue seene thy face , as though I had seene the face of God ; and thou wast pleased with me .
Take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt graciously with mee , and because I haue enough : and hee vrged him , and he tooke it .
And he said , Let vs take our iourney , and let vs goe , and I will goe before thee .
And hee said vnto him , My lord knoweth , that the children are tender , and the flockes and heards with yong are with mee : and if men should ouer - driue them one day , all the flocke will die .
Let my lord , I pray thee , passe ouer before his seruant , and I will leade on softly , according as the cattell that goeth before me , and the children be able to endure , vntill I come vnto my lord vnto Seir .
And Esau said , Let me now leaue with thee some of the folke that are with me : And hee said , What needeth it ? let me finde grace in the sight of my lord .
¶ So Esau returned that day , on his way vnto Seir .
And Iacob iourneyed to Succoth , and built him an house , and made boothes for his cattell : therefore the name of the place is called Succoth .
¶ And Iacob came to Shalem , a citie of Shechem , which is the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan Aram , and pitched his tent before the Citie .
And he bought a parcell of a field where hee had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor Shechems father , for an hundred pieces of money .

And Dinah the daughter of Leah , which shee bare vnto Iacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
And when Shechem the sonne of Hamor the Hiuite , prince of the countrey saw her , he tooke her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
And his soule claue vnto Dinah the daughter of Iacob , and hee loued the damsell , and spake kindly vnto the damsell .
And Shechem spake vnto his father Hamor , saying , Get mee this damsell to wife .
And Iacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter ( now his sonnes were with his cattel in the field ) and Iacob helde his peace vntill they were come .
¶ And Hamor the father of Shechem went out vnto Iacob to commune with him .
And the sonnes of Iacob came out of the field when they heard it , and the men were grieued : and they were very wroth , because hee had wrought folly in Israel , in lying with Iacobs daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
And Hamor communed with them , saying , The soule of my sonne Shechem longeth for your daughter : I pray you giue her him to wife .
And make ye mariages with vs , and giue your daughters vnto vs , and take our daughters vnto you .
And ye shall dwell with vs , and the land shall be before you : dwell and trade you therein , and get you possessions therein .
And Shechem said vnto her father , and vnto her brethren , Let mee finde grace in your eyes , and what yee shall say vnto me , I will giue .
Aske mee neuer so much dowrie and gift , and I will giue according as yee shall say vnto mee : but giue me the damsell to wife .
And the sonnes of Iacob answered Shechem , and Hamor his father deceitfully , and said , because he had defiled Dinah their sister .
And they saide vnto them , wee cannot doe this thing , to giue our sister to one that is vncircumcised : for that were a reproch vnto vs .
But in this will we consent vnto you : If ye will be as we be , that euery male of you be circumcised :
Then wil we giue our daughters vnto you , and we wil take your daughters to vs , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
But if ye will not hearken vnto vs , to be circumcised , then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
And their words pleased Hamor , and Shechem Hamors sonne .
And the yong man deferred not to doe the thing , because he had delight in Iacobs daughter : and he was more honourable then all the house of his father .
¶ And Hamor and Shechem his sonne came vnto the gate of their citie , and communed with the men of their citie , saying :
These men are peaceable with vs , therefore let them dwel in the land , and trade therein : for the land , behold , it is large enough for them : let vs take their daughters to vs for wiues , and let vs giue them our daughters .
Onely herein will the men consent vnto vs , for to dwell with vs to be one people , if euery male among vs bee circumcised , as they are circumcised .
Shall not their cattell , and their substance , and euery beast of theirs bee ours ? onely let vs consent vnto them , and they will dwell with vs .
And vnto Hamor and vnto Shechem his sonne , hearkened all that went out of the gate of his citie ; and euery male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his citie .
¶ And it came to passe on the thirde day when they were sore , that two of the sonnes of Iacob , Simeon and Leui , Dinahs brethren , tooke each man his sword and came vpon the citie boldly , and slew all the males .
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his sonne , with the edge of the sword , and tooke Dinah out of Shechems house , and went out .
The sonnes of Iacob came vpon the slaine , and spoiled the citie , because they had defiled their sister .
They tooke their sheepe , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the citie , and that which was in the field .
And all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wiues tooke they captiue , and spoiled euen all that was in the house .
And Iacob said to Simeon and Leui , Ye haue troubled me to make me to stinke among the inhabitants of the land , amongst the Canaanites , and the Perizzites : and I being few in number , they shall gather themselues together against me , and slay me , and I shal be destroyed , I and my house .

And God said vnto Iacob , Arise , goe vp to Bethel , and dwel there : and make there an Altar vnto God , that appeared vnto thee , when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother .
Then Iacob said vnto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and bee cleane , and change your garments ,
And let vs arise , and goe vp to Bethel , and I will make there an Altar vnto God , who answered me in the day of my distresse , and was with me in the way which I went .
And they gaue vnto Iacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their eare - rings which were in their eares , and Iacob hid them vnder the oke which was by Shechem .
And they iourneyed : and the terrour of God was vpon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sonnes of Iacob .
¶ So Iacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan ( that is Bethel ) hee and all the people that were with him .
And hee built there an Altar , and called the place El - Bethel , because there God appeared vnto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
But Deborah Rebekahs nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel vnder an oke : and the name of it was called Allon Bachuth .
¶ And God appeared vnto Iacob againe , when he came out of Padan Aram , and blessed him .
And God said vnto him , Thy name is Iacob : thy name shall not bee called any more Iacob , but Israel shall bee thy name ; and hee called his name Israel .
And God saide vnto him , I am God Almightie : be fruitfull and multiply : a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and Kings shall come out of thy loynes .
And the land which I gaue Abraham , and Isaac , to thee I will giue it , and to thy seed after thee will I giue the land .
And God went vp from him , in the place where he talked with him .
And Iacob set vp a pillar in the place where he talked with him , euen a pillar of stone : and hee powred a drinke offering thereon , and he powred oile thereon .
And Iacob called the name of the place where God spake with him , Bethel . ¶ And they iourneyed from Bethel : and there was but a litle way to come to Ephrath ; and Rachel traueiled , and she had hard labour .
And it came to passe when shee was in hard labour , that the midwife said vnto her , Feare not : thou shalt haue this sonne also .
And it came to passe as her soule was in departing , ( for she died ) that she called his name Ben - oni : but his father called him Beniamin .
And Rachel died , and was buried in the way to Ephrath , which is Bethlehem .
And Iacob set a pillar vpon her graue : that is the pillar of Rachels graue vnto this day .
¶ And Israel iourneyed and spread his tent beyond the towre of Edar .
And it came to passe when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went & lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine : and Israel heard it . Now the sonnes of Iacob were twelue .
The sonnes of Leah : Reuben Iacobs first borne , and Simeon , and Leui , and Iudah , and Issachar , and Zebulun .
The sonnes of Rachel : Ioseph , and Beniamin .

And Iacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
These are the generations of Iacob : Ioseph being seuenteene yeeres old , was feeding the flocke with his brethren , and the lad was with the sonnes of Bilhah , and with the sonnes of Zilpah , his fathers wiues : and Ioseph brought vnto his father their euill report .
Now Israel loued Ioseph more then all his children , because he was the sonne of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
And when his brethren saw that their father loued him more then all his brethren , they hated him , and could not speake peaceably vnto him .
¶ And Ioseph dreamed a dreame , and he told it his brethren , and they hated him yet the more .
And he said vnto them , Heare , I pray you , this dreame which I haue dreamed .
For beholde , wee were binding sheaues in the field , and loe , my sheafe arose , and also stood vpright ; and behold , your sheaues stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheafe .
And his brethren saide to him , Shalt thou indeed reigne ouer vs ? or shalt thou indeed haue dominion ouer vs ? and they hated him yet the more , for his dreames , and for his words .
¶ And hee dreamed yet another dreame , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I haue dreamed a dreame more : and behold , the sunne and the moone , and the eleuen starres made obeisance to me .
And he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebuked him , and said vnto him , What is this dreame that thou hast dreamed ? shal I , and thy mother , and thy brethren indeed come to bow downe our selues to thee , to the earth ?
And Israel saide vnto Ioseph , Doe not thy brethren feed the flocke in Shechem ? Come , and I will send thee vnto them : & he said to him , Here am I .
And he said to him , Goe , I pray thee , see whether it bee well with thy brethren , and well with the flockes , and bring me word againe : so hee sent him out of the vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
¶ And a certaine man found him , and behold , hee was wandring in the field , and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
And he said , I seeke my brethren : tell me , I pray thee , where they feede their flockes .
And the man said , They are departed hence : for I heard them say , Let vs goe to Dothan . And Ioseph went after his brethren , and found them in Dothan .
And when they saw him a farre off , euen before he came neere vnto them , they conspired against him , to slay him .
And they said one to another , Behold , this dreamer commeth .
Come now therefore , and let vs slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some euill beast hath deuoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreames .
And Reuben heard it , and he deliuered him out of their hands , and said ; Let vs not kill him .
And Reuben saide vnto them , Shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wildernesse , and lay no hand vpon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliuer him to his father againe .
¶ And it came to passe when Ioseph was come vnto his brethren , that they stript Ioseph out of his coate , his coat of many colours that was on him .
And they tooke him and cast him into a pit : and the pit was emptie , there was no water in it .
And they sate downe to eat bread : and they lift vp their eyes and looked , and behold , a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead , with their camels , bearing spicery , & baulme , and myrrhe , going to cary it downe to Egypt .
And Iudah saide vnto his brethren , What profit is it if we slay our brother , and conceale his blood ?
Come , and let vs sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand bee vpon him : for he is our brother , and our flesh ; and his brethren were content .
Then there passed by Midianites merchant men , and they drew and lift vp Ioseph out of the pit , and sold Ioseph to the Ishmeelites for twentie pieces of siluer : and they brought Ioseph into Egypt .
¶ And Reuben returned vnto the pit , and behold , Ioseph was not in the pit : and he rent his clothes .
And hee returned vnto his brethren and said , The childe is not , and I , whither shall I goe ?
And they tooke Iosephs coat , and killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood .
And they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father , and said , This haue we found : know now whether it bee thy sonnes coat or no .
And he knew it , and said , It is my sonnes coat : an euil beast hath deuoured him ; Ioseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
And Iacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth vpon his loines , & mourned for his sonne many dayes .
And all his sonnes , and all his daughters rose vp to comfort him : but he refused to be comforted : and he said , For I will goe downe into the graue vnto my sonne , mourning ; thus his father wept for him .

And it came to passe at that time , that Iudah went downe from his brethren , and turned in to a certaine Adullamite , whose name was Hirah :
And she yet againe conceiued and bare a sonne , and called his name Shelah : and hee was at Chezib , when shee bare him .
And Iudah tooke a wife for Er his first borne , whose name was Tamar .
And Er , Iudahs first borne was wicked in the sight of the LORD , and the LORD slew him .
And Iudah said vnto Onan , Goe in vnto thy brothers wife , and marrie her , and raise vp seed to thy brother .
And Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to passe when hee went in vnto his brothers wife , that hee spilled it on the ground , least that hee should giue seed to his brother .
And the thing which he did , displeased the LORD : wherefore hee slew him also .
Then said Iudah to Tamar his daughter in law , Remaine a widow at thy fathers house , til Shelah my sonne be growen : ( for he said , Lest peraduenture he die also as his brethren did ) and Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house .
¶ And in processe of time , the daughter of Shuah Iudahs wife died : and Iudah was comforted , and went vp vnto his sheepe - shearers to Timnath , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
And it was told Lamar , saying , Behold , thy father in law goeth vp to Timnath to sheare his sheepe .
And shee put her widowes garments off from her , and couered her with a vaile , and wrapped her selfe , and sate in an open place , which is by the way to Timnath : for shee sawe that Shelah was growen , and she was not giuen vnto him to wife .
When Iudah saw her , he thought her to be an harlot : because she had couered her face .
And hee turned vnto her by the way , and said , Goe to , I pray thee , let me come in vnto thee : ( for he knew not that she was his daughter in law ) and she said , what wilt thou giue mee , that thou mayest come in vnto me ?
And hee said , I will send thee a kid from the flocke : and shee saide , Wilt thou giue mee a pledge , till thou send it ?
And he said , What pledge shall I giue thee ? And she said , Thy signet , and thy bracelets , and thy staffe , that is in thine hand : and he gaue it her , & came in vnto her , and she conceived by him .
And shee arose and went away , and laid by her vaile from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
And Iudah sent the kidde by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive his pledge from the womans hand : but he found her not .
Then hee asked the men of that place , saying , where is the harlot , that was openly by the way side ? And they said , There was no harlot in this place .
And he returned to Iudah , and said , I cannot finde her : and also the men of the place said , That there was no harlot in this place .
And Iudah said , Let her take it to her , lest we bee shamed : behold , I sent this kidde , and thou hast not found her .
¶ And it came to passe about three moneths after , that it was tolde Iudah , saying , Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot , and also behold , she is with child by whoredom : and Iudah said , Bring her foorth , and let her be burnt .
When she was brought forth , she sent to her father in law , saying , By the man whose these are , am I with child : and shee said , Discerne , I pray thee , whose are these , the signet , and bracelets , and staffe .
And Iudah acknowledged them , and said , She hath bin more righteous then I : because that I gaue her not to Shelah my sonne : and he knew her againe no more .
¶ And it came to passe in the time of her trauaile , that beholde , twinnes were in her wombe .
And it came to passe when shee trauailed , that the one put out his hand , and the midwife tooke and bound vpon his hand a skarlet threed , saying , This came out first .
And it came to passe as he drewe backe his hand , that behold , his brother came out : and she said , how hast thou broken foorth ? this breach bee vpon thee : Therefore his name was called Pharez .

And Ioseph was brought downe to Egypt , and Potiphar an Officer of Pharaoh , captaine of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hand of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him downe thither .
And the LORD was with Ioseph , and hee was a prosperous man , and hee was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
And his master sawe that the LORD was with him , and that the LORD made all that he did , to prosper in his hand .
And Ioseph found grace in his sight , and he serued him ; and hee made him ouerseer ouer his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
And it came to passe from the time that hee had made him overseer in his house , and ouer all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptians house for Iosephs sake : and the blessing of the LORD was vpon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
And he left all that he had , in Iosephs hand : and he knew not ought he had , saue the bread which he did eate : and Ioseph was a goodly person , and well fauoured .
¶ And it came to passe after these things , that his masters wife cast her eyes vpon Ioseph , and shee said , Lie with me .
But he refused , and said vnto his masters wife , Behold , my master wotteth not what is with mee in the house , and he hath committed all that he hath , to my hand .
There is none greater in this house then I : neither hath hee kept backe any thing from me , but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I doe this great wickednesse , and sinne against God ?
And it came to passe as she spake to Ioseph day by day , that hee hearkened not vnto her , to lie by her , or to bee with her .
And it came to passe about this time , that Ioseph went in to the house , to doe his busines , and there was none of the men of the house there within .
And shee caught him by his garment , saying , Lie with me : and he left his garment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
And it came to passe , when she saw that hee had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ;
That she called vnto the men of her house , and spake vnto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew vnto vs , to mocke vs : he came in vnto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice .
And it came to passe , when hee heard that I lifted vp my voice , and cried , that he left his garment with mee , and fled , and got him out .
And she laid vp his garment by her , vntill her lord came home .
And she spake vnto him , according to these words , saying , The Hebrew seruant which thou hast brought vnto vs , came in vnto me to mocke me .
And it came to passe as I lift vp my voice , and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
¶ But the LORD was with Ioseph , and shewed him mercie , and gaue him fauour in the sight of the keeper of the prison . And the keeper of the prison committed to Iosephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison , and whatsoeuer they did there , he was the doer of it :
<NON-VERSE> And it came to passe after these things , that the Butler of the King of Egypt , and his Baker , had offended their lord the King of Egypt .
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers , against the chiefe of the Butlers , and against the chiefe of the Bakers .
And he put them in ward in the house of the captaine of the guard , into the prison , the place where Ioseph was bound . And the captaine of the guard charged Ioseph with them , and he serued them , and they continued a season in warde .
¶ And they dreamed a dreame both of them , each man his dreame in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dreame , the Butler and the Baker of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
And Ioseph came in vnto them in the morning , and looked vpon them , and behold , they were sad .
And he asked Pharaohs officers that were with him in the warde of his lords house , saying , wherefore looke ye so sadly to day ?
And they said vnto him , we haue dreamed a dreame , and there is no interpreter of it . And Ioseph said vnto them , Doe not interpretations belong to God ? tell me them , I pray you .
And the chiefe Butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph , and said to him ; In my dreame , beholde , a vine was before mee :
And in the vine were three branches , and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot foorth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes .
And Pharaohs cup was in my hand , and I tooke the grapes and pressed them into Pharaohs cup : and I gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand .
And Ioseph said vnto him , This is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three dayes ,
Yet within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thine head , and restore thee vnto thy place , and thou shalt deliuer Pharaohs cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his Butler .
But thinke on me , when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindenesse , I pray thee , vnto mee , and make mention of me vnto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house .
For indeed I was stollen away out of the land of the Hebrewes : and here also haue I done nothing , that they should put me into the dungeon .
When the chiefe Baker saw , that the interpretation was good , he said vnto Ioseph , I also was in my dreame , and behold , I had three white baskets on my head .
And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner of bake - meats for Pharaoh , and the birds did eat them out of the basket vpon my head .
And Ioseph answered , and said , This is the interpretation thereof : the three baskets are three dayes :
Yet within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree , and the birds shall eate thy flesh from off thee .
¶ And it came to passe the third day , which was Pharaohs birth day , that hee made a feast vnto all his seruaunts : and he lifted vp by the head of the chiefe Butler , and of the chiefe Baker among his seruants .
And he restored the chiefe Butler vnto his Butlership againe , and hee gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand .
But he hanged the chiefe Baker , as Ioseph had interpreted to them .

And it came to passe at the end of two ful yeeres , that Pharaoh dreamed : and beholde , hee stood by the riuer .
And behold , there came vp out of the riuer seuen well fauoured kine , and fat fleshed , and they fed in a medow .
And behold , seuen other kine came vp after them out of the riuer , ill fauoured and leane fleshed , and stood by the other kine , vpon the brinke of the riuer .
And the ill fauoured and leane fleshed kine , did eate vp the seuen well fauoured and fat kine : So Pharaoh awoke .
And hee slept and dreamed the second time : and beholde , seuen eares of corne came vp vpon one stalke , ranke and good .
And beholde , seuen thinne eares and blasted with the Eastwind , sprang vp after them .
And the seuen thinne eares deuoured the seuen ranke and full eares : and Pharaoh awoke , and behold , it was a dreame .
And it came to passe in the morning , that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all the Magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh tolde them his dreame ; but there was none that could interprete them vnto Pharaoh .
¶ Then spake the chiefe Butler vnto Pharaoh , saying , I doe remember my faults this day .
Pharaoh was wroth with his seruants , and put mee in warde , in the captaine of the guards house , both mee , and the chiefe Baker .
And we dreamed a dreame in one night , I and he : we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dreame .
And there was there with vs a yong man an Hebrew , seruant to the captaine of the guard : and wee told him , and he interpreted to vs our dreames , to each man according to his dreame , he did interpret .
And it came to passe , as he interpreted to vs , so it was ; mee he restored vnto mine office , and him he hanged .
¶ Then Pharaoh sent and called Ioseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : And he shaued himselfe , and changed his raiment , and came in vnto Pharaoh .
And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph , I haue dreamed a dreame , and there is none that can interpret it : and I haue heard say of thee , that thou canst vnderstand a dreame , to interpret it .
And Ioseph answered Pharaoh , saying ; It is not in me : God shall giue Pharaoh an answere of peace .
And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph ; In my dreame , behold , I stood vpon the banke of the riuer .
And behold , there came vp out of the riuer seuen kine , fat fleshed and well fauoured , and they fed in a medow .
And behold , seuen other kine came vp after them , poore and very ill fauoured , and leane fleshed , such as I neuer saw in all the land of Egypt for badnes .
And the leane , & the ill fauoured kine , did eate vp the first seuen fat kine .
And when they had eaten them vp , it could not bee knowen that they had eaten them , but they were still ill fauoured , as at the beginning : So I awoke .
And I saw in my dreame , and behold , seuen eares came vp in one stalke , full and good .
And behold , seuen eares withered , thin & blasted with the East wind , sprung vp after them .
And the thin eares deuoured the seuen good eares : and I told this vnto the magicians , but there was none that could declare it to me .
¶ And Ioseph said vnto Pharaoh , the dreame of Pharaoh is one ; God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to doe .
The seuen good kine are seuen yeeres : and the seuen good eares are seuen yeeres : the dreame is one .
And the seuen thin and ill fauoured kine that came vp after them , are seuen yeeres : and the seuen emptie eares blasted with the East wind , shall bee seuen yeeres of famine .
This is the thing which I haue spoken vnto Pharaoh : what God is about to doe , he sheweth vnto Pharaoh .
Behold , there come seuen yeeres of great plentie , throughout all the land of Egypt .
And there shall arise after them , seuen yeeres of famine , and all the plentie shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt : and the famine shall consume the land .
And the plentie shal not be knowen in the land , by reason of that famine following : for it shalbe very grieuous .
And for that the dreame was doubled vnto Pharaoh twice , it is because the thing is established by God : and God will shortly bring it to passe . Now therfore let Pharaoh looke out a man discreet and wise , and set him ouer the land of Egypt .
Let Pharaoh doe this , and let him appoint officers ouer the land , & take vp the fift part of the land of Egypt , in the seuen plenteous yeeres .
And let them gather all the food of those good yeeres that come , and lay vp corne vnder the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keepe food in the cities .
And that food shall be for store to the land , against the seuen yeeres of famine , which shall bee in the land of Egypt , that the land perish not through the famine .
¶ And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his seruants .
And Pharaoh said vnto his seruants , Can we find such a one , as this is , a man in whom the spirit of God is ?
And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph , Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this , there is none so discreete and wise , as thou art :
Thou shalt be ouer my house , and according vnto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater then thou .
And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph , See , I haue set thee ouer all the land of Egypt .
And Pharaoh tooke off his ring from his hand , & put it vpon Iosephs hand , and arayed him in vestures of fine linnen , and put a gold chaine about his necke .
And he made him to ride in the second charet which he had : and they cried before him , Bow the knee : and he made him ruler ouer all the land of Egypt .
And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph , I am Pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift vp his hand or foote , in all the land of Egypt .
And Pharaoh called Iosephs name , Zaphnath - Paaneah , and he gaue him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti - pherah , priest of On : and Ioseph went out ouer all the lande of Egypt .
( ¶ And Ioseph was thirtie yeeres old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt ) and Ioseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went thorowout all the land of Egypt .
And in the seuen plenteous yeres the earth brought forth by handfuls .
And he gathered vp all the foode of the seuen yeeres , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid vp the foode in the cities : the foode of the field which was round about euery citie , laid he vp in the same .
And Ioseph gathered corne as the sand of the sea , very much , vntill he left numbring : for it was without number .
And vnto Ioseph were borne two sonnes , before the yeeres of famine came : which Asenath the daughter of Poti - pherah , Priest of On bare vnto him .
And Ioseph called the name of the first borne Manasseh : for God , said hee , hath made me forget all my toile , and all my fathers house .
And the name of the second called he Ephraim : for God hath caused mee to be fruitfull in the land of my affliction .
¶ And the seuen yeeres of plenteousnesse , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
And the seuen yeeres of dearth beganne to come according as Ioseph had saide , and the dearth was in all lands : but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
And when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread : and Pharaoh said vnto all the Egyptians , Goe vnto Ioseph : what he saith to you , doe .
And the famine was ouer all the face of the earth ; and Ioseph opened all the storehouses , and solde vnto the Egyptians : and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
<NON-VERSE>
Now when Iacob saw that there was corne in Egypt , Iacob said vnto his sonnes , Why doe ye looke one vpon an other ?
And hee said , Beholde , I haue heard that there is corne in Egypt : get you downe thither and buy for vs from thence , that we may liue , and not die .
¶ And Iosephs ten brethren went downe to buy corne in Egypt .
But Beniamin Iosephs brother , Iacob sent not with his brethren : for he said , Lest peraduenture mischiefe befall him .
And the sonnes of Israel came to buy corne among those that came : for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
And Ioseph was the gouernour ouer the land , and hee it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Iosephs brethren came , & bowed downe themselues before him , with their faces to the earth .
And Ioseph saw his brethren , and he knew them , but made himselfe strange vnto them , and spake roughly vnto them ; and hee saide vnto them , Whence come ye ? And they said , From the land of Canaan , to buy food .
And Ioseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
And Ioseph remembred the dreames which hee dreamed of them , and said vnto them , Ye are spies : to see the nakednes of the land you are come .
And they said vnto him , Nay , my lord , but to buy food are thy seruants come .
We are all one mans sonnes , we are true men : thy seruants are no spies .
And he said vnto them , Nay : but to see the nakednesse of the land , you are come .
And they said , Thy seruants are twelue brethren , the sonnes of one man in the land of Canaan : and behold , the yongest is this day with our father , and one is not .
And Ioseph said vnto them , That is it that I spake vnto you , saying , Ye are spies .
Hereby ye shall be proued : by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not goe foorth hence , except your yongest brother come hither .
Send one of you , and let him fetch your brother , and ye shalbe kept in prison , that your wordes may be proued , whether there be any trueth in you : or els by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies .
And he put them all together into warde , three dayes .
And Ioseph said vnto them the third day , This doe , and liue : for I feare God .
If ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison : goe ye , carry corne for the famine of your houses .
But bring your yongest brother vnto mee , so shall your wordes be verified , and yee shall not die : and they did so .
¶ And they said one to another , We are verily guiltie concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soule , when he besought vs , and we would not heare : therefore is this distresse come vpon vs .
And Reuben answered them , saying , Spake I not vnto you , saying , Doe not sinne against the childe , and ye would not heare ? therefore behold also , his blood is required .
And they knew not that Ioseph vnderstood them : for hee spake vnto them by an interpreter .
And hee turned himselfe about from them and wept , and returned to them againe , and communed with them , and tooke from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
¶ Then Ioseph commanded to fill their sackes with corne , and to restore euery mans money into his sacke , and to giue them prouision for the way : and thus did he vnto them .
And they laded their asses with the corne , and departed thence .
And as one of them opened his sacke , to giue his asse prouender in the Inne , he espied his money : for behold , it was in his sackes mouth .
And he said vnto his brethren , My money is restored , and loe , it is euen in my sacke : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to an other , What is this that God hath done vnto vs ?
¶ And they came vnto Iacob their father , vnto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell vnto them , saying ;
The man who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to vs , and tooke vs for spies of the countrey .
And we said vnto him , We are true men ; we are no spies .
We be twelue brethren , sonnes of our father : one is not , and the yongest is this day with our father , in the land of Canaan .
And the man the lord of the countrey said vnto vs , Hereby shall I know that ye are true men : leaue one of your brethren here with me , and take foode for the famine of your housholds , and be gone .
And bring your yongest brother vnto me : then shall I know that you are no spies , but that you are true men : so will I deliuer you your brother , and ye shall traffique in the land .
¶ And it came to passe as they emptied their sacks , that behold , euery mans bundle of money was in his sacke : and when both they and their father saw the bundels of money , they were afraid .
And Iacob their father said vnto them , We haue ye bereaued of my children : Ioseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye wil take Beniamin away : all these things are against me .
And Reuben spake vnto his father , saying ; Slay my two sonnes , if I bring him not to thee : deliuer him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee againe .
<NON-VERSE>
And the famine was sore in the land .
And it came to passe when they had eaten vp the corne , which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said vnto them , Goe againe , buy vs a little foode .
And Iudah spake vnto him , saying , The man did solemnly protest vnto vs , saying , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you . If thou wilt send our brother with vs , we will goe downe and buy thee food .
But if thou wilt not send him , we will not goe downe : for the man saide vnto vs , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
And Israel said , Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ?
And they said , The man asked vs straitly of our state , and of our kindred , saying , Is your father yet aliue ? haue yee another brother ? and we tolde him according to the tenour of these words : Could we certainely knowe that he would say , Bring your brother downe ?
And Iudah said vnto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and wee will arise and go , that we may liue , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
I will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if I bring him not vnto thee , and set him before thee , then let me beare the blame for euer .
For except we had lingred , surely now wee had returned this second time .
And their father Israel said vnto them , If it must bee so now , doe this : take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels , and carie downe the man a Present , a litle balme , and a litle honie , spices , and myrrhe , nuts , and almonds .
And take double money in your hand , and the money that was brought againe in the mouth of your sackes : carie it againe in your hand , peraduenture it was an ouersight .
Take also your brother , and arise , goe againe vnto the man .
And God Almightie giue you mercie before the man , that he may send away your other brother , and Beniamin : If I be bereaued of my children , I am bereaued .
¶ And the men tooke that Present , and they tooke double money in their hand , and Beniamin , and rose vp , and went downe to Egypt , and stood before Ioseph .
And when Ioseph sawe Beniamin with them , hee said to the ruler of his house , Bring these men home , and slay , and make ready : for these men shall dine with me at noone .
And they came neere to the steward of Iosephs house , and they communed with him at the doore of the house ,
And said , O Sir , we came indeed downe at the first time to buy food .
And it came to passe when wee came to the Inne , that wee opened our sackes , and behold , euery mans money was in the mouth of his sacke , our money in ful weight : and we haue brought it againe in our hand .
And other money haue wee brought downe in our handes to buy food : we cannot tell who put our money in our sackes .
And he said , Peace be to you , feare not : your God , and the God of your father , hath giuen you treasure in your sackes : I had your money . And hee brought Simeon out vnto them .
And the man brought the men into Iosephs house , and gaue them water , and they washed their feete , and he gaue their asses prouender .
And they made ready the Present against Ioseph came at noone : for they heard that they should eate bread there .
¶ And when Ioseph came home , they brought him the Present which was in their hand , into the house , and bowed themselues to him to the earth .
And he asked them of their welfare , and said , Is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? Is he yet aliue ?
And they answered , Thy seruant our father is in good health , hee is yet aliue : & they bowed downe their heads , and made obeisance .
And he lift vp his eyes , and sawe his brother Beniamin , his mothers sonne , and said , Is this your yonger brother , of whom yee spake vnto mee ? and he said , God be gracious vnto thee , my sonne .
And Ioseph made haste : for his bowels did yerne vpon his brother : and he sought where to weepe , and hee entred into his chamber , & wept there .
And he washed his face , and went out , and refrained himselfe , and saide , Set on bread .
And they set on for him by himselfe , and for them by themselues , and for the Egyptians which did eate with him , by themselues : because the Egyptians might not eate bread with the Hebrewes : for that is an abomination vnto the Egyptians .
And they sate before him , the first borne according to his birthright , and the yongest according to his youth : and the men marueiled one at another .
<NON-VERSE>
And hee commaunded the steward of his house , saying , Fill the mens sackes with food , as much as they can carie , and put euery mans money in his sacks mouth .
And put my cup , the siluer cup , in the sackes mouth of the youngest , and his corne money : and he did according to the word that Ioseph had spoken .
Assoone as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they , and their asses .
And when they were gone out of the citie , and not yet farre off , Ioseph said vnto his steward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou doest ouertake them , say vnto them , Wherefore haue ye rewarded euill for good ?
Is not this it , in which my lord drinketh ? and whereby indeed he diuineth ? ye haue done euill in so doing .
¶ And he ouertooke them , and he spake vnto them these same words .
And they said vnto him , Wherefore saith my lord these words ? God forbid that thy seruants should doe according to this thing .
Behold , the money which wee found in our sackes mouthes , wee brought againe vnto thee , out of the land of Canaan : how then should wee steale out of thy lords house , siluer or golde ?
With whom soeuer of thy seruants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lords bondmen .
And he said , Now also let it be according vnto your wordes : hee with whom it is found , shall be my seruant : and ye shall be blamelesse .
Then they speedily tooke downe euery man his sacke to the ground , and opened euery man his sacke .
And he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the yongest : and the cup was found in Beniamins sacke .
Then they rent their clothes , and laded euery man his asse , and returned to the citie .
¶ And Iudah and his brethren came to Iosephs house : ( for he was yet there ) and they fell before him on the ground .
And Ioseph said vnto them , What deed is this that ye haue done ? wote ye not , that such a man as I can certainely diuine ?
And Iudah said , What shall wee say vnto my lord ? what shal we speake ? or how shall we cleare our selues ? God hath found out the iniquitie of thy seruants : beholde , wee are my lords seruants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
And he said , God forbid that I should doe so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shal be my seruant ; and as for you , get you vp in peace vnto your father .
¶ Then Iudah came neere vnto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy seruant , I pray thee , speake a word in my lords eares , & let not thine anger burne against thy seruant : for thou art euen as Pharaoh .
My lord asked his seruants , saying ; Haue ye a father , or a brother ?
And we said vnto my lord , Wee haue a father , an olde man , and a childe of his old age , a little one : and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loueth him .
And thou saidst vnto thy seruants , Bring him downe vnto mee , that I may set mine eyes vpon him .
And we said vnto my lord , The lad cannot leaue his father : for if hee should leaue his father , his father would die .
And our father said , Goe againe , and buy vs a little food .
And we saide , Wee cannot goe downe : if our yongest brother be with vs , then will we goe downe : for wee may not see the mans face , except our yongest brother be with vs .
And thy seruant my father said vnto vs , Ye know that my wife bare me two sonnes .
And the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torne in pieces : and I saw him not since .
And if ye take this also from me , and mischiefe befall him , ye shall bring downe my gray haires with sorrow to the graue .
Now therefore when I come to thy seruant my father , and the lad bee not with vs ; ( seeing that his life is bound vp in the lads life . )
It shall come to passe , when he seeth that the lad is not with vs , that he will die , and thy seruants shall bring downe the gray haires of thy seruant our father with sorrow to the graue .
For thy seruant became surety for the lad vnto my father , saying , If I bring him not vnto thee , then I shall beare the blame to my father , for euer .
Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy seruant abide in stead of the lad , a bondman to my lord , and let the lad goe vp with his brethren .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Ioseph could not refraine himselfe before all them that stood by him : and he cried , Cause euery man to goe out from me ; and there stood no man with him , while Ioseph made himselfe knowen vnto his brethren .
And he wept aloud : and the Egyptians , and the house of Pharaoh heard .
And Ioseph said vnto his brethren , I am Ioseph ; Doeth my father yet liue ? and his brethren could not answere him : for they were troubled at his presence .
And Ioseph said vnto his brethren , Come neere to me , I pray you : and they came neere ; and he said , I am Ioseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
Now therefore bee not grieued , nor angry with your selues , that yee sold me hither : for God did send me before you , to preserue life .
For these two yeeres hath the famine bene in the land : and yet there are fiue yeeres , in the which there shall neither be earing nor haruest .
And God sent me before you , to preserue you a posteritie in the earth , and to saue your liues by a great deliuerance .
So now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
Haste you , and goe vp to my father , and say vnto him , Thus saith thy sonne Ioseph ; God hath made me lord of all Egypt ; come downe vnto me , tary not .
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be neere vnto me , thou , and thy children , and thy childrens children , and thy flockes , and thy heards , and all that thou hast .
And there wil I nourish thee , ( for yet there are fiue yeeres of famine ) lest thou and thy houshold , and all that thou hast , come to pouertie .
And behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Beniamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh vnto you .
And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you haue seene , and ye shall haste , and bring downe my father hither .
And he fel vpon his brother Beniamins necke , and wept : and Beniamin wept vpon his necke .
Moreouer hee kissed all his brethren , and wept vpon them : and after that , his brethren talked with him .
¶ And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaohs house , saying , Iosephs brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his seruants .
Now thou art commanded , this doe yee ; Take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wiues , and bring your father , and come .
Also regard not your stuffe : for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours .
And the children of Israel did so : and Ioseph gaue them wagons , according to the commandement of Pharaoh , and gaue them prouision for the way .
To all of them he gaue each man changes of raiment : but to Beniamin hee gaue three hundred pieces of siluer , and fiue changes of raiment .
And to his father hee sent after this maner : ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten shee asses laden with corne , and bread and meat for his father by the way .
So he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and hee said vnto them , See that yee fall not out by the way .
¶ And they went vp out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan vnto Iacob their father ,
And told him , saying , Ioseph is yet aliue , and he is gouernour ouer all the land of Egypt . And Iacobs heart fainted , for he beleeued them not .
And they told him all the words of Ioseph , which hee had saide vnto them : and when hee saw the wagons which Ioseph had sent to carie him , the spirit of Iacob their father reuiued .
<NON-VERSE>
And Israel tooke his iourney with all that hee had , and came to Beersheba , and offered sacrifices vnto the God of his father Isaac .
And God spake vnto Israel in the visions of the night , and said , Iacob , Iacob . And he said , Here am I .
And he said , I am God , the God of thy father , feare not to goe downe into Egypt : for I will there make of thee a great nation .
I will goe downe with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee vp againe : and Ioseph shall put his hand vpon thine eyes .
And Iacob rose vp from Beersheba : and the sonnes of Israel caried Iacob their father , and their litle ones , and their wiues , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to cary him .
And they tooke their cattell , and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Iacob , and all his seed with him :
His sonnes , and his sonnes sonnes with him , his daughters , and his sonnes daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
¶ And these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Iacob and his sonnes : Reuben Iacobs first borne ;
And the sonnes of Reuben , Hanoch , and Phallu , and Hezron , and Carmi .

These are the sonnes of Rachel which were borne to Iacob : all the soules were fourteene . ¶ And the sonnes of Dan : Hushim .
¶ And the sonnes of Naphtali : Iahzeel , and Guni , and Iezer , and Shillem .
These are the sonnes of Bilhah , which Laban gaue vnto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these vnto Iacob : all the soules were seuen .
All the soules that came with Iacob into Egypt , which came out of his loines , besides Iacobs sonnes wiues , all the soules were threescore and sixe .
And the sonnes of Ioseph , which were borne him in Egypt , were two soules : all the soules of the house of Iacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
¶ And he sent Iudah before him vnto Ioseph , to direct his face vnto Goshen , and they came into the lande of Goshen .
And Ioseph made ready his charet , and went vp to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himselfe vnto him : and he fell on his necke , and wept on his necke a good while .
And Israel saide vnto Ioseph , Now let me die , since I haue seene thy face , because thou art yet aliue .
And Ioseph said vnto his brethren , and vnto his fathers house , I will goe vp , and shew Pharaoh , and say vnto him , My brethren , & my fathers house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come vnto me .
And the men are sheapheards , for their trade hath bene to feed cattell : and they haue brought their flocks , and their heards , and all that they haue .
And it shall come to passe when Pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , What is your occupation ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then Ioseph came and tolde Pharaoh , and saide , My father and my brethren , and their flockes , and their heards , and all that they haue , are come out of the land of Canaan : and behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
And hee tooke some of his brethren , euen fiue men , & presented them vnto Pharaoh .
And Pharaoh said vnto his brethren , What is your occupation ? And they said vnto Pharaoh , Thy seruants are shepheards , both wee and also our fathers .
They said moreouer vnto Pharaoh , For to soiourne in the land are we come : for thy seruants haue no pasture for their flockes , for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore we pray thee , let thy seruants dwel in the land of Goshen .
And Pharaoh spake vnto Ioseph , saying , Thy father and thy brethren are come vnto thee .
The land of Egypt is before thee : in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell , in the lande of Goshen let them dwell : and if thou knowest any man of actiuitie amongst them , then make them rulers ouer my cattell .
And Ioseph brought in Iacob his father , and set him before Pharaoh : and Iacob blessed Pharaoh . And Pharaoh said vnto Iacob , How old art thou ?
And Iacob said vnto Pharaoh , The dayes of the yeeres of my pilgrimage are an hundred & thirtie yeres : few and euill haue the dayes of the yeeres of my life bene , and haue not attained vnto the dayes of the yeeres of the life of my fathers , in the dayes of their pilgrimage .
And Iacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
¶ And Ioseph placed his father , and his brethren , and gaue them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
And Ioseph nourished his father and his brethren , and all his fathers houshold with bread , according to their families .
¶ And there was no bread in all the land : for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
And Ioseph gathered vp all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corne which they bought : and Ioseph brought the money into Pharaohs house .
And when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came vnto Ioseph , and said , Giue vs bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
And Ioseph said , Giue your cattell : and I will giue you for your catell , if money faile .
And they brought their cattel vnto Ioseph : and Ioseph gaue them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flockes , and for the cattell of the heards , and for the asses , and he fed them with bread , for all their cattel , for that yeere .
When that yeere was ended , they came vnto him the second yeere , and said vnto him , We will not hide it from my lord , how that our money is spent , my lord also had our heards of cattell : there is not ought left in the sight of my lord , but our bodies , and our lands .
And as for the people , he remoued them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt , euen to the other ende thereof .
Onely the land of the Priests bought he not : for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh , and did eate their portion which Pharaoh gaue them : wherefore they solde not their lands .
Then Ioseph said vnto the people , Behold , I haue bought you this day , and your land for Pharaoh : Loe , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
And it shall come to passe in the increase , that you shall giue the fift part vnto Pharaoh , and foure parts shall be your owne , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your litle ones .
And they said , Thou hast saued our liues : let vs find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaohs seruants .
And Ioseph made it a law ouer the land of Egypt vnto this day , that Pharaoh should haue the fift part : except the land of the priests onely , which became not Pharaohs .
¶ And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the countrey of Goshen , and they had possessions therein , and grew , and multiplied exceedingly .
But I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carie mee out of Egypt , and bury me in their burying place : and he said , I will doe as thou hast said .

And it came to passe after these things , that one told Ioseph , Behold , thy father is sicke : and he tooke with him his two sonnes , Manasseh and Ephraim .
And one told Iacob , and said , Behold , thy sonne Ioseph commeth vnto thee : and Israel strengthened himselfe , and sate vpon the bed .
And Iacob saide vnto Ioseph , God Almightie appeared vnto mee at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed mee ,
And said vnto me , Behold , I wil make thee fruitfull , and multiplie thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people , and will giue this land to thy seede after thee , for an euerlasting possession .
¶ And now thy two sonnes , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were borne vnto thee in the land of Egypt , before I came vnto thee into Egypt , are mine : as Reuben and Simeon , they shalbe mine .
And thy issue which thou begettest after them , shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
And as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan , in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come vnto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath , the same is Bethlehem .
And Israel behelde Iosephs sonnes , and said , Who are these ?
And Ioseph said vnto his father , They are my sonnes , whom God hath giuen me in this place : and he said , Bring them , I pray thee , vnto me , and I will blesse them .
( Now the eyes of Israel were dimme for age , so that he could not see , ) and hee brought them neere vnto him , and he kissed them , and imbraced them .
And Israel said vnto Ioseph , I had not thought to see thy face : and loe , God hath shewed me also thy seed .
And Ioseph brought them out from betweene his knees , and hee bowed himselfe with his face to the earth .
And Ioseph tooke them both , Ephraim in his right hand , toward Israels left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israels right hand , and brought them neere vnto him .
And Israel stretched out his right hand , and layd it vpon Ephraims head who was the yonger ; and his left hand vpon Manassehs head , guiding his hands wittingly : for Manasseh was the first borne .
¶ And he blessed Ioseph and said , God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walke , the God which fedde mee all my life long vnto this day ,
The Angel which redeemed mee from all euill , blesse the laddes , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac , and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
And when Ioseph saw that his father laide his right hand vpon the head of Ephraim , it displeased him : and he held vp his fathers hand , to remoue it from Ephraims head , vnto Manassehs head .
And Ioseph saide vnto his father , Not so my father : for this is the first borne ; put thy right hand vpon his head .
And his father refused , and said , I know it , my sonne , I know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truely his yonger brother shall be greater then he ; and his seede shall become a multitude of nations .
And he blessed them that day , saying , In thee shall Israel blesse , saying , God make thee as Ephraim , and as Manasseh : and he set Ephraim before Manasseh .
And Israel saide vnto Ioseph , Behold , I die : but God shall be with you , and bring you againe vnto the land of your fathers .

Gather your selues together , and heare ye sonnes of Iacob , and hearken vnto Israel your father .
¶ Reuben , thou art my first borne , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellencie of dignitie , and the excellencie of power :
Unstable as water , thou shalt not excell , because thou wentest vp to thy fathers bed : then defiledst thou it . He went vp to my couche .
¶ Simeon and Leui are brethren , instruments of crueltie are in their habitations .
O my soule , come not thou into their secret : vnto their assembly mine honour be not thou vnited : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfe will they digged downe a wall .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruell : I will diuide them in Iacob , and scatter them in Israel .
¶ Iudah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise : thy hand shall be in the necke of thine enemies , thy fathers children shall bow downe before thee .
Iudah is a Lyons whelpe : from the pray my sonne thou art gone vp : he stouped downe , hee couched as a Lyon , and as an old Lyon : who shall rouse him vp ?
The scepter shall not depart from Iudah , nor a Law - giuer from betweene his feete , vntill Shiloh come : and vnto him shall the gathering of the people be :
Binding his foale vnto the vine , and his asses colt vnto the choice vine ; he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes .
His eyes shall be red with wine , and his teeth white with milke .
¶ Zebulun shall dwell at the hauen of the sea , and hee shall be for an Hauen of ships : and his border shall be vnto Zidon .

And he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant : and bowed his shoulder to beare , and became a seruant vnto tribute .

Dan shalbe a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heeles , so that his rider shall fall backward .

¶ Gad , a troupe shall ouercome him : but he shall ouercome at the last .

¶ Ioseph is a fruitfull bough , euen a fruitfull bough by a well , whose branches runne ouer the wall .
The archers haue sorely grieued him , and shot at him , and hated him .
But his bow abode in strength , and the armes of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the mighty God of Iacob : from thence is the Sheapheard , the stone of Israel ,
Euen by the God of thy father who shall helpe thee , and by the Almightie , who shall blesse thee with blessings of heauen aboue , blessings of the deepe that lyeth vnder , blessings of the breasts and of the wombe .
The blessings of thy father haue preuailed aboue the blessings of my progenitors : vnto the vtmost bound of the euerlasting hils , they shall bee on the head of Ioseph , and on the crowne of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .
¶ Beniamin shall rauine as a wolfe : In the morning hee shall deuoure the pray , and at night he shall diuide the spoile .
¶ All these are the twelue tribes of Israel , and this is it that their father spake vnto them , and blessed them : euery one according to his blessing he blessed them .
And hee charged them and said vnto them , I am to bee gathered vnto my people : burie me with my fathers , in the caue that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
In the caue that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite , for a possession of a burying place .
( There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife , there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife , and there I buried Leah . )
The purchase of the field and of the caue that is therein , was from the children of Heth .

And Ioseph fell vpon his fathers face , and wept vpon him , and kissed him .
And Ioseph commanded his seruants the physicians to imbalme his father : and the physicians imbalmed Israel .
And fortie dayes were fulfilled for him , ( for so are fulfilled the dayes of those which are imbalmed ) and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten dayes .
And when the dayes of his mourning were past , Ioseph spake vnto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I haue found grace in your eyes , speake , I pray you , in the eares of Pharaoh , saying ,
My father made me sweare , saying , Loe , I die : in my graue which I haue digged for me , in the land of Canaan , there shalt thou bury me . Now therfore let me goe vp , I pray thee , and bury my father , and I will come againe .
And Pharaoh said , Goe vp , and bury thy father , according as he made thee sweare .
¶ And Ioseph went vp to bury his father : and with him went vp all the seruants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
And all the house of Ioseph , and his brethren , and his fathers house : onely their litle ones , and their flockes , and their heards , they left in the land of Goshen .
And there went vp with him both charets and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
And they came to the threshing floore of Atad , which is beyond Iordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seuen dayes .

And his sonnes did vnto him according as he commanded them .
For his sonnes caried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the caue of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place , of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
¶ And Ioseph returned into Egypt , he and his brethren , and all that went vp with him , to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
¶ And when Iosephs brethren saw that their father was dead , they said , Ioseph will peraduenture hate vs , and will certainely requite vs all the euill which we did vnto him .
And they sent a messenger vnto Ioseph , saying , Thy father did command before he died , saying ,
So shall ye say vnto Ioseph , Forgiue , I pray thee now , the trespasse of thy brethren , and their sinne : for they did vnto thee euill : And now wee pray thee , forgiue the trespasse of the seruants of the God of thy father . And Ioseph wept , when they spake vnto him .
And his brethren also went and fell downe before his face , and they said , Behold , we be thy seruants .
And Ioseph saide vnto them , Feare not : for am I in the place of God ?
But as for you , yee thought euill against me , but God meant it vnto good , to bring to passe , as it is this day , to saue much people aliue .

The burden which Habakkuk the Prophet did see .
O Lord , howe long shall I crie , and thou wilt not heare ! euen cry out vnto thee of violence , and thou wilt not saue ?
Why doest thou shew me iniquity , & cause me to behold grieuance ? for spoiling and violence are before me : & there are that raise vp strife and contention .
Therefore the Lawe is slacked , and iudgement doeth neuer goe foorth : for the wicked doeth compasse about the righteous : therfore wrong iudgement proceedeth .
¶ Behold ye among the heathen , and regard , and wonder marueilously : for I wil worke a worke in your daies , which yee will not beleeue , though it be tolde you .
For loe , I raise vp the Caldeans , that bitter and hastie nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possesse the dwelling places that are not theirs .
They are terrible and dreadfull : their iudgement and their dignity shal proceed of themselues .
Their horses also are swifter then the leopards , and are more fierce then the euening wolues : & their horsemen shall spread themselues , and their horsemen shall come from farre , they shall flie as the Eagle that hasteth to eate .
They shall come all for violence : their faces shall sup vp as the East winde , and they shall gather the captiuitie as the sand .
And they shal scoffe at the Kings , and the Princes shall bee a scorne vnto them : they shall deride euery strong holde , for they shall heape dust & take it .
Then shall his minde change , and he shall passe ouer , and offend , imputing this his power vnto his God .
¶ Art thou not from euerlasting , O Lord my God , mine Holy one ? we shall not die : O Lord , thou hast ordained them for iudgement , and O mightie God , thou hast established them for correction .
Thou art of purer eyes then to beholde euill , and canst not looke on ininquitie : wherefore lookest thou vpon them that deale treacherously , and holdest thy tongue when the wicked deuoureth the man that is more righteous then hee ?
And makest men as the fishes of the Sea , as the creeping things , that haue no ruler ouer them .
They take vp all of them with the angle : they catch them in their net , and gather them in their dragge ; therefore they reioyce and are glad .
Therefore they sacrifice vnto their net , and burne incense vnto their drag : because by them their portion is fat , and their meat plenteous .

And the Lord answered me and said , write the vision , and make it plaine vpon tables , that he may runne that readeth it .
For the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tary , wait for it , because it will surely come , it wil not tary .
Behold , his soule which is lifted vp , is not vpright in him ; but the iust shall liue by his faith .
¶ Yea also , because he transgresseth by wine , he is a proud man , neither keepeth at home , who enlargeth his desire as hell , and is as death , and cannot be satisfied , but gathereth vnto him all nations , & heapeth vnto him all people :
Shal not all these take vp a parable against him , and a tanting prouerbe against him , and say ; Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his : how long ? and to him that ladeth himselfe with thicke clay .
Shall they not rise vp suddenly that shall bite thee ? and awake , that shall vexe thee ? and thou shalt be for booties vnto them ?
Because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shal spoile thee : because of mens blood , and for the violence of the land , of the citie , and of all that dwell therein .
¶ Woe to him that coueteth an euill couetousnesse to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that hee may be deliuered from the power of euill .
Thou hast consulted shame to thy house , by cutting off many people , and hast sinned against thy soule .
For the stone shall crie out of the wall , and the beame out of the timber shall answere it .
¶ Woe to him that buildeth a towne with blood , and stablisheth a citie by iniquitie .
Behold , is it not of the Lord of hostes , that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shal wearie themselues for very vanitie ?
For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as the waters couer the Sea .
¶ Woe vnto him that giueth his neighbour drinke : that puttest thy bottell to him , and makest him drunken also ; that thou mayest looke on their nakednesse .
Thou art filled with shame for glory : drinke thou also , and let thy foreskin bee vncouered : the cup of the Lords right hand shall be turned vnto thee , and shamefull spewing shalbe on thy glory .

A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet vpon Sigionoth .
O Lord , I haue heard thy speach , and was afraide : O Lord , reuiue thy worke in the midst of the yeeres , in the midst of the yeeres make knowen ; in wrath remember mercy .
God came from Teman , and the holy on from mount Paran Selah . His glory couered the heauens and the earth was full of his praise .
And his brightnesse was as the light : he had hornes comming out of his hand , and there was the hiding of his power :
Before him went the pestilence , and burning coales went forth at his feete .
He stood and measured the earth : hee beheld and droue asunder the nations , and the euerlasting mountaines were scattered , the perpetuall hilles did bowe : his wayes are euerlasting .
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction : and the curtaines of the land of Midian did tremble .
Was the Lord displeased against the riuers ? was thine anger against the riuers ? was thy wrath against the Sea , that thou didst ride vpon thine horses , and thy charets of saluation ?
Thy bow was made quite naked according to the oathes of the tribes , euen thy word . Selah . Thou didst cleaue the earth with riuers .
The mountaines sawe thee , and they trembled : the ouerflowing of the water passed by : the deepe vttered his voyce , and lift vp his hands on high .
The Sunne and Moone stood still in their habitation : at the light of thine arrowes they went , and at the shining of thy glittering speare .
Thou didst march through the land in indignation , thou didst thresh the heathen in anger .
Thou wentest forth for the saluation of thy people , euen for saluation with thine Anointed , thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discouering the foundation vnto the necke . Selah .
Thou didst strike through with his staues the head of his villages : they came out as a whirle - winde to scatter me : their reioycing was as to deuoure the poore secretly .
Thou didst walke through the Sea with thine horses , through the heape of great waters .
When I heard , my belly trembled : my lips quiuered at the voice : rottennesse entred into my bones , and I trembled in my selfe , that I might rest in the day of trouble : when hee commeth vp vnto the people , he wil inuade them with his troupes .
¶ Although the fig tree shall not blossome , neither shall fruite bee in the vines : the labour of the Oliue shall faile , and the fields shal yeeld no meat , the flocke shall be cut off from the folde , and there shalbe no heard in the stalles :
Yet I will reioyce in the Lord : I will ioy in the God of my saluation .

In the second yeere of Darius the king , in the sixt moneth , in the first day of the moneth came the worde of the Lord by Haggai the Prophet vnto Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel , gouernour of Iudah , and to Iosuah the sonne of Iosedech the high priest , saying ;
Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes , saying ; This people say , The time is not come , the time that the Lords house should be built .
Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet , saying ;
Is it time for you , O yee , to dwell in your sieled houses , and this house lie waste ?
Nowe therefore thus saith the Lord of hostes ; Consider your wayes .
Yee haue sowen much and bring in litle : ye eate , but ye haue not inough : yee drinke , but yee are not filled with drinke : yee cloth you , but there is none warme : and hee that earneth wages , earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes .
¶ Thus saith the Lord of hostes , Consider your wayes .
Goe vp to the mountaine , and bring wood , and build the house ; and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , saith the Lord .
Ye looked for much , and loe it came to litle : and when yee brought it home , I did blow vpon it : Why , saith the Lord of hostes ? because of mine house that is waste , and yee runne euery man vnto his owne house .
Therefore the heauen ouer you is stayed from dew , and the earth is staied from her fruite .
And I called for a drought vpon the land and vpon the mountaines , and vpon the corne , and vpon the new wine , and vpon the oyle , and vpon that which the ground bringeth forth , & vpon men , and vpon cattell , and vpon all the labour of the hands .
¶ Then Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel , and Iosuah the sonne of Iosedech the high priest , with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voyce of the Lord their God , and the words of Haggai the Prophet ( as the Lord their God had sent him ) and the people did feare before the Lord .
Then spake Haggai the Lords messenger in the Lords message vnto the people , saying ; I am with you , saith the Lord .
And the Lord stirred vp the spirit of Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel gouernour of Iudah , and the spirit of Iosuah the sonne of Iosedech the high priest , and the spirit of all the remnant of the people , and they came and did worke in the house of the Lord of hostes their God :
<NON-VERSE>
In the seuenth moneth , in the one and twentith day of the moneth , came the word of the Lord by the Prophet Haggai , saying ;
Speake now to Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel , gouernour of Iudah , and to Iosuah the sonne of Iosedech the high priest , and to the residue of the people , saying ,
Who is left among you that sawe this house in her first glory ? and how do ye see it now ? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it , as nothing ?
Yet now be strong , O Zerubbabel , saith the Lord , and bee strong , O Ioshua , sonne of Iosedech the high Priest , and be strong all ye people of the land , saith the Lord , and worke : ( for I am with you , saith the Lord of hosts , )
According to the word that I couenanted with you , when ye came out of Egypt , so my Spirit remaineth among you , Feare ye not .
For thus saith the Lord of hosts , Yet once , it is a litle while , and I will shake the heauens , and the earth , and the sea , and the drie land .
And I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come , and I will fill this house with glory , saith the Lord of hosts .
The siluer is mine , and the gold is mine , saith the Lord of hosts .
The glory of this latter house shal be greater then of the former , saith the Lord of hostes : and in this place will I giue peace , saith the Lord of hostes .
¶ In the foure and twentieth day of the ninth moneth , in the second yeere of Darius , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the Prophet , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Aske now the priests concerning the law , saying ,
If one beare holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt doe touch bread or pottage , or wine , or oile , or any meate , shall it be holy ? and the priests answered and said , No .
Then said Haggai , If one that is vncleane by a dead body , touch any of these , shal it be vncleane ? and the priests answered and said , It shalbe vncleane .
Then answered Haggai , and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith the Lord , and so is euery worke of their hands , and that which they offer there , is vncleane . And now I pray you consider from this day and vpward , from before a stone was laid vpon a stone in the Temple of the Lord .
Since those dayes were , when one came to an heape of twentie measures , there were but ten : when one came to the presse - fatte for to draw out fiftie vessels out of the presse , there were but twentie .
I smote you with blasting , and with mildew , and with haile in all the labours of your hands : yet yee turned not to me , saith the Lord .
Consider now from this day , and vpward from the foure and twentieth day of the ninth moneth , euen from the day that the foundatio of the Lords Temple was laid , consider it .
Is the seed yet in the barne ? yea , as yet the vine and the fig tree , & the pomegranate , and the Oliue tree hath not brought foorth : from this day will I blesse you .
¶ And againe the worde of the Lord came vnto Haggai in the foure and twentieth day of the moneth , saying ,
Speake to Zerubbabel gouernor of Iudah , saying , I wil shake the heauens and the earth .
And I will ouerthrow the throne of kingdomes , and I will destroy the strength of the kingdomes of the heathen , and I will ouerthrow the charets , and those that ride in them , and the horses and their riders shall come downe , euery one by the sword of his brother .

God who at sundry times , and in diuers manners , spake in time past vnto the Fathers by the Prophets ,
Hath in these last dayes spoken vnto vs by his Sonne , whom he hath appointed heire of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ,
Who being the brightnesse of his glory , and the expresse image of his person , and vpholding all things by the word of his power , when hee had by himselfe purged our sinnes , sate down on the right hand of the Maiestie on high ,
Being made so much better then the Angels , as hee hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name then they .
For vnto which of the Angels said he at any time , Thou art my sonne , this day haue I begotten thee ? And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Sonne .
And againe , when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world , hee saith , And let all the Angels of God worship him .
And of the Angels he saith : Who maketh his Angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
But vnto the Sonne , he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for euer and euer : a scepter of righteousnesse is the scepter of thy kingdome .
Thou hast loued righteousnesse , and hated iniquitie , therefore God , euen thy God hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes .
And , thou Lord in the beginning hast layed the foundation of the earth : and the heauens are the works of thine hands .
They shall perish , but thou remainest : and they all shal waxe old as doth a garment .
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them vp , and they shall be changed , but thou art the same , and thy yeeres shall not faile ?
But to which of the Angels said hee at any time , Sit on my right hand , vntill I make thine enemies thy footstoole ?
<NON-VERSE>
Therefore we ought to giue the more earnest heede to the things which we haue heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
For if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast , and euery transgression and disobedience receiued a iust recompense of reward :
How shall we escape , if we neglect so great saluation , which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord , and was confirmed vnto vs by them that heard him ,
God also bearing them witnesse , both with signes & wonders , and with diuers miracles , and gifts of the holy Ghost , according to his owne will ?
For vnto the Angels hath he not put in subiection the world to come , whereof we speake .
But one in a certaine place testified , saying : What is man , that thou art mindfull of him : or the Sonne of man that thou visitest him ?
Thou madest him a little lower then the Angels , thou crownedst him with glory and honor , and didst set him ouer the workes of thy hands .
Thou hast put all things in subiection vnder his feete . For in that he put all in subiection vnder him , hee left nothing that is not put vnder him . But now wee see not yet all things put vnder him .
But wee see Iesus , who was made a little lower then the Angels , for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour , that hee by the grace of God should taste death for euery man .
For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sonnes vnto glory , to make the Captaine of their saluation perfect through sufferings .
For both hee that sanctifieth , and they who are sanctified , are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to cal them brethren ,
Saying , I will declare thy Name vnto my brethren , in the midst of the Church will I sing praise vnto thee .
And againe , I will put my trust in him : and againe , Behold , I , and the children which God hath giuen me .
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood , he also himselfe likewise took part of the same , that through death hee might destroy him that had the power of death , that is , the deuill :
And deliuer them , who through feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage .
For verely he tooke not on him the nature of Angels : but he tooke on him the seed of Abraham .
Wherfore in all things it behooued him to bee made like vnto his brethren , that he might be a mercifull and faithfull high Priest , in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sinnes of the people .
<NON-VERSE>
Wherfore holy brethren partakers of the heauenly calling , consider the Apostle and high Priest of our profession Christ Iesus ,
Who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithfull in all his house .
For this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses , in as much as he who hath builded the house , hath more honour then the house .
For euery house is builded by some man , but hee that built all things is God .
And Moses verely was faithfull in all his house as a seruant , for a testimonie of those things which were to be spoken after .
But Christ as a Sonne ouer his owne house , whose house are wee , if we hold fast the confidence , and the reioycing of the hope firme vnto the end .
Wherfore as the holy Ghost saith , To day if ye will heare his voyce ,
Harden not your hearts , as in the prouocation , in the day of temptation in the wildernesse :
When your fathers tempted me , prooued me , and saw my works fourty yeeres .
Wherefore I was grieued with that generation , and sayd , They doe alway erre in their hearts , and they haue not knowen my wayes .
So I sware in my wrath : they shall not enter into my rest .
Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe , in departing from the liuing God .
But exhort one another dayly , while it is called To day , least any of you be hardned through the deceitfulnesse of sinne .
For wee are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast vnto the end .
Whilest it is sayd , To day if yee will heare his voice , harden not your hearts , as in the prouocation .
For some when they had heard , did prouoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
But with whom was he grieued fourty yeeres ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wildernesse ?
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that beleeued not ?
<NON-VERSE>
Let vs therefore feare , lest a promise being left vs , of entring into his rest , any of you should seeme to come short of it .
For vnto vs was the Gospel preached , as well as vnto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
For we which haue beleeued do enter into rest , as hee said , As I haue sworne in my wrath , if they shall enter into my rest , although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
For he spake in a certaine place of the seuenth day on this wise : And God did rest the seuenth day from all his works .
And in this place againe : If they shall enter into my rest .
Seeing therfore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached , entred not in because of vnbeleefe :
Againe , hee limiteth a certaine day , saying in Dauid , To day , after so long a time ; as it is saide , To day if ye will heare his voyce , harden not your hearts .
For if Iesus had giuen them rest , then would he not afterward haue spoken of another day .
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God .
For he that is entred into his rest , hee also hath ceased from his owne works , as God did from his .
Let vs labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of vnbeleefe .
For the word of God is quicke and powerfull , and sharper then any two edged sword , pearcing euen to the diuiding asunder of soule and spirit , and of the ioynts and marrowe , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked , and opened vnto the eyes of him with whome wee haue to doe .
Seeing then that wee haue a great high Priest , that is passed into the heauens , Iesus the Sonne of God , let vs hold fast our profession .
For wee haue not an high Priest which cannot bee touched with the feeling of our infirmities : but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sinne .
<NON-VERSE>
For euery high Priest taken from among men , is ordeined for men in things pertaining to God , that hee may offer both giftes & sacrifices for sins .
Who can haue compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way , for that he himselfe also is compassed with infirmitie .
And by reason heereof hee ought as for the people , so also for himselfe , to offer for sinnes .
And no man taketh this honour vnto himselfe , but hee that is called of God , as was Aaron .
So also , Christ glorified not himselfe , to bee made an High Priest : but hee that saide vnto him , Thou art my Sonne , to day haue I begotten thee .
As he saith also in another place , Thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedec .
Who in the dayes of his flesh , when hee had offered vp prayers and supplications , with strong crying and teares , vnto him that was able to saue him from death , and was heard , in that he feared .
Though hee were a Sonne , yet learned hee obedience , by the things which he suffered :
And being made perfect , he became the authour of eternall saluation vnto all them that obey him ,
Called of God an high Priest after the order of Melchisedec :
Of whom we haue many things to say , and hard to be vttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing .
For when for the time yee ought to bee teachers , yee haue neede that one teach you againe which be the first principles of the Oracles of God , and are become such as haue need of milke , and not of strong meat .
For euery one that vseth milke , is vnskilful in the word of righteousnes : for he is a babe .
<NON-VERSE>
Therefore leauing the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let vs goe on vnto perfection , not laying againe the foundation of repentance from dead workes , and of faith towards God ,
Of the doctrine of Baptismes , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternall iudgement .
And this will we doe , if God permit .
For it is impossible for those who were once inlightned , and haue tasted of the heauenly gift , and were made partakers of the holy Ghost ,
And haue tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the world to come ;
If they shall fall away , to renue them againe vnto repentance : seeing they crucifie to themselues the Sonne of God afresh , and put him to an open shame .
For the earth which drinketh in the raine that commeth oft vpon it , and bringeth forth herbes meet for them by whome it is dressed , receiueth blessing from God .
But that which beareth thornes and briers , is reiected , and is nigh vnto cursing , whose end is to be burned .
But beloued , wee are perswaded better things of you , and things that accompany saluation , though we thus speake .
For God is not vnrighteous , to forget your worke and labour of loue , which yee haue shewed toward his Name , in that yee haue ministred to the Saints , and doe minister .
And wee desire , that euery one of you doe shewe the same diligence , to the full assurance of hope vnto the ende :
That yee be not slothfull , but followers of them , who through faith and patience inherite the promises .
For when God made promise to Abraham , because hee could sweare by no greater , he sware by himselfe ,
Saying , Surely , blessing I will blesse thee , and multiplying I wil multiply thee .
And so after he had patiently indured , he obtained the promise .
For men verily sweare by the greater , and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
Wherein God willing more abundantly to shewe vnto the heyres of promise the immutabilitie of his counsell , confirmed it by an oath :
That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lye , wee might haue a strong consolation , who haue fled for refuge to lay hold vpon the hope set before vs .
Which hope we haue as an anker of the soule both sure and stedfast , and which entreth into that within the vaile ,
<NON-VERSE>
For this Melchisedec king of Salem , Priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings , and blessed him :
To whom also Abraham gaue a tenth part of all : first being by interpretation king of righteousnesse , and after that also king of Salem , which is , king of peace .
Without father , without mother , without descent , hauing neither beginning of dayes nor end of life : but made like vnto the Sonne of God , abideth a Priest continually .
Now consider how great this man was , vnto whom euen the patriarch Abraham gaue the tenth of the spoiles .
And verily they that are of the sonnes of Leui , who receiue the office of the Priesthood , haue a commandement to take Tithes of the people according to the Law , that is of their brethren , though they come out of the loines of Abraham :
But he whose descent is not counted from them , receiued tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
And without all contradiction , the lesse is blessed of the better .
And here men that die receiue tithes : but there hee receiueth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liueth .
And as I may so say , Leui also who receiueth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham .
For hee was yet in the loynes of his Father when Melchisedec met him .
If therefore perfection were by the Leuiticall Priesthood ( for vnder it the people receiued the Law ) what further neede was there , that another Priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not bee called after the order of Aaron ?
For the Priesthood being chaunged , there is made of necessitie a change also of the Law .
For hee of whom these things are spoken , pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gaue attendance at the Altar .
For it is euident that our Lorde sprang out of Iuda , of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning Priesthood .
And it is yet farre more euident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another Priest ,
Who is made not after the Law of a carnall commandement , but after the power of an endles life .
For hee testifieth ; Thou art a Priest for euer , after the order of Melchisedec .
For there is verily a disanulling of the commandement going before , for the weakenesse and vnprofitablenesse thereof .
For the Law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did : by the which wee draw nigh vnto God . And in as much as not without an othe he was made Priest ,
( For those Priests were made without an oath : but this with an oath , by him that said vnto him , The Lord sware and wil not repent , thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedec )
By so much was Iesus made a suertie of a better Testament .
And they truely were many Priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death .
But this man because hee continueth euer , hath an vnchangeable Priesthood .
Wherefore he is able also to saue them to the vttermost , that come vnto God by him , seeing hee euer liueth to make intercession for them .
For such an high Priest became vs , who is holy , harmelesse , vndefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher then the heauens .
Who needeth not daily , as those high Priests , to offer vp sacrifice , first for his owne sins and then for the peoples : for this he did once , when he offered vp himselfe .
<NON-VERSE>
Now of the things which we haue spoken , this is the summe : wee haue such an high Priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Maiestie in the heauens :
A minister of the Sanctuary , and of the true Tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man .
For euery high Priest is ordeined to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessitie that this man haue somewhat also to offer .
For if he were on earth , he should not bee a Priest , seeing that there are Priests that offer gifts according to the Law :
Who serue vnto the example and shadow of heauenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle . For see ( saith he ) that thou make all things according to the paterne shewed to thee in the mount .
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministerie , by how much also he is the Mediatour of a better Couenant , which was established vpon better promises .
For if that first Couenant had bene faultles , then should no place haue bene sought for the second .
For finding fault with them , hee saith , Behold , the dayes come ( saith the Lord ) when I will make a new couenant with the house of Israel , and the house of Iudah .
Not according to the Couenant that I made with their fathers , in the day when I tooke them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , because they continued not in my Couenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
For this is the Couenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those dayes , saith the Lord : I wil put my Lawes into their minde , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shalbe to me a people .
And they shall not teach euery man his neighbour , and euery man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : For all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
For I will be mercifull to their vnrighteousnes , and their sins & their iniquities will I remember no more .
<NON-VERSE>
Then verily the first Couenant had also ordinances of diuine Seruice , and a worldly Sanctuary .
For there was a Tabernacle made , the first , wherein was the Candlesticke , and the Table , and the Shewbread , which is called the Sanctuarie .
And after the second vaile , the Tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all :
Which had the golden Censor , and the Arke of the Couenant ouerlayed round about with gold , wherein was the Golden pot that had Manna , and Aarons rod that budded , and the Tables of the Couenant .
And ouer it the Cherubims of glory shadowing the Mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speake particularly .
Now when these things were thus ordained , the Priestes went alwayes into the first Tabernacle , accomplishing the seruice of God .
But into the second went the high Priest alone once euery yeere , not without blood , which he offered for himselfe , and for the errors of the people .
The holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the Holiest of all , was not yet made manifest , while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing :
Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offred both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the seruice perfect , as pertayning to the conscience ,
Which stood onely in meates and drinkes , and diuers washings , and carnall ordinances imposed on them vntill the time of reformation .
But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building :
Neither by the blood of Goats and Calues : but by his owne blood hee entred in once into the Holy place , hauing obtained eternall redemption for vs .
For if the blood of Bulls , and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the vncleane , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit , offered himselfe without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead workes , to serue the liuing God ?
And for this cause hee is the Mediatour of the New Testament , that by meanes of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were vnder the first Testament , they which are called , might receiue the promise of eternall inheritance .
For where a Testament is , there must also of necessitie bee the death of the Testatour .
For a Testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all whilest the Testatour liueth .
Whereupon , neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood .
For when Moses had spoken euery precept to all the people according to the Law , he tooke the blood of Calues and of Goates , with water and scarlet wooll , and hysope , and sprinckled both the booke and all the people ,
Saying , This is the blood of the Testament which God hath enioyned vnto you .
Moreouer , hee sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle , and all the vessels of the Ministery .
And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood : and without shedding of blood is no remission .
It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heauens should bee purified with these , but the heauenly things themselues with better sacrifices then these .
For Christ is not entred into the Holy places made with handes , which are the figures of the true , but into heauen it selfe , now to appeare in the presence of God for vs .
Nor yet that he should offer himselfe often , as the high Priest entreth into the Holy place , euery yeere with blood of others :
For then must hee often haue suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world , hath he appeared to put away sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe .
And as it is appointed vnto men once to die , but after this the Iudgement :
<NON-VERSE>
For the Law hauing a shadow of good things to come , and not the very Image of the things , can neuer with those sacrifices which they offered yeere by yeere continually , make the commers thereunto perfect :
For then would they not haue ceased to be offered , because that the worshippers once purged , should haue had no more conscience of sinnes ?
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance againe made of sinnes euery yeere .
In burnt offerings , and sacrifices for sinne thou hast had no pleasure :
Then said I , Loe , I come . ( In the volume of the booke it is written of me ) to doe thy will , O God .
Aboue when hee said , Sacrifice , and offering , and burnt offerings , and offering for sinne thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein , which are offered by the Law :
Then said he , Loe , I come to doe thy will ( O God : ) He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
By the which will wee are sanctified , through the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once for all .
And euery Priest standeth dayly ministring and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can neuer take away sinnes .
But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes for euer , sate downe on the right hand of God ,
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstoole .
For by one offering hee hath perfected for euer them that are sanctified .
Whereof the holy Ghost also is a witnesse to vs : for after that he had said before ,
This is the Couenant that I wil make with them after those dayes , saith the Lord : I will put my Lawes into their hearts , and in their mindes will I write them :
And their sinnes and iniquities will I remember no more .
Now , where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sinne .
Hauing therefore , brethren , boldnesse to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Iesus ,
By a new and liuing way which hee hath consecrated for vs , through the vaile , that is to say , His flesh :
And hauing an high Priest ouer the house of God :
Let vs drawe neere with a true heart in full assurance of faith , hauing our hearts sprinkled from an euill conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
Let vs hold fast the profession of our faith without wauering ( for he is faithfull that promised )
And let vs consider one another to prouoke vnto loue , and to good workes :
Not forsaking the assembling of our selues together , as the manner of some is : but exhorting one another , and so much the more , as ye see the day approching .
For if we sinne wilfully after that we haue receiued the knowledge of the trueth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinnes ,
But a certaine fearefull looking for of iudgement , and fiery indignation , which shall deuoure the aduersaries .
Hee that despised Moses Lawe , died without mercy , vnder two or three witnesses .
Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye , shall hee be thought worthy , who hath troden vnder foote the Sonne of God , and hath counted the blood of the couenant wherwith he was sanctified , an vnholy thing , and hath done despite vnto the spirit of grace ?
For we know him that hath said , Uengeance belongeth vnto me , I wil recompence , saith the Lord : and again , The Lord shall iudge his people .
It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God .
But call to remembrance the former dayes , in which after yee were illuminated , ye indured a great fight of afflictions :
Partly whilest ye were made a gazing stocke both by reproches & afflictions , and partly whilest ye became companions of them that were so vsed .
For yee had compassion of me in my bonds , and tooke ioyfully the spoyling of your goods , knowing in your selues that yee haue in heauen a better and an induring substance .
Cast not away therfore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward .
For ye haue need of patience , that shall after ye haue done the will of God ye might receiue the promise .
For yet a litle while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tary .
Now the iust shall liue by faith : but if any man drawe backe , my soule shall haue no pleasure in him .
<NON-VERSE>
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the euidence of things not seen .
For by it the Elders obtained a good report .
Through faith we vnderstand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seene were not made of things which doe appeare .
By faith Abel offered vnto God a more excellent sacrifice then Kain , by which he obtained witnes that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead , yet speaketh .
By faith Enoch was translated , that he should not see death , and was not found , because God had translated him : For before his translation he had this testimonie , that he pleased God .
But without faith it is impossible to please him : for hee that commeth to God , must beleeue that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seeke him .
By faith Noah being warned of God of things not seene as yet , moued with feare , prepared an Arke to the sauing of his house , by the which he condemned the world , and became heire of the righteousnesse which is by faith .
By faith Abraham when he was called to goe out into a place which hee should after receiue for an inheritance , obeyed , and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
By faith hee soiourned in the land of promise , as in a strange countrey , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Iacob , the heires with him of the same promise .
For hee looked for a citie which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
Through faith also Sara her selfe receiued strength to conceiue seede , and was deliuered of a child when she was past age , because she iudged him faithful who had promised .
Therfore sprang there euen of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the starres of the skie in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
These all died in faith , not hauing receiued the promises , but hauing seene them a farre off , and were perswaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
For they that say such things , declare plainly that they seeke a countrey .
And truly if they had been mindfull of that countrey , from whence they came out , they might haue had opportunitie to haue returned :
But now they desire a better countrey , that is , an heauenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to bee called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
By faith Abraham when he was tried , offered vp Isaac : and he that had receiued the promises , offered vp his onely begotten sonne ,
Of whom it was said , That , in Isaac shall thy seed be called :
Accounting that God was able to raise him vp , euen from the dead : from whence also he receiued him in a figure .
By faith Isaac blessed Iacob and Esau concerning things to come .
By faith Iacob when hee was a dying , blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph , and worshipped leaning vpon the top of his staffe .
By faith , Ioseph when hee died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel : and gaue commandement concerning his bones .
By faith ; Moses when hee was borne was hid three moneths of his parents , because they saw he was a proper childe , and they not afraid of the Kings commandement .
By faith Moses when hee was come to yeeres , refused to bee called the sonne of Pharaohs daughter ,
Chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , then to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season :
Esteeming the reproch of Christ greater riches then the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect vnto the recompense of the reward .
By faith hee forsooke Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he indured , as seeing him who is inuisible .
Through faith he kept the Passeouer , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the first borne , should touch them .
By faith they passed through the red sea , as by drie land : which the Egyptians assaying to do , were drowned .
By faith the walles of Iericho fell downe , after they were compassed about seuen dayes .
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that beleeued not , when shee had receiued the spies with peace .
And what shall I more say ? for the time would faile mee to tell of Gideon , and of Barak , and of Sampson , and of Iephthah , of Dauid also and Samuel , and of the Prophets :
Who through faith subdued kingdomes , wrought righteousnesse , obteined promises , stopped the mouthes of Lions ,
Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakenesse were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
Women receiued their dead raised to life againe : and others were tortured , not accepting deliuerance , that they might obtaine a better resurrection .
And others had triall of cruell mockings and scourgings , yea moreouer , of bonds and imprisonment .
They were stoned , they were sawen asunder , were tempted , were slaine with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskinnes , and goat skins , being destitute , afflicted , tormented .
Of whome the world was not worthy : they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dennes and caues of the earth .
And these all hauing obtained a good report through faith , receiued not the promise :
<NON-VERSE>
Wherefore , seeing wee also are compassed about with so great a cloude of witnesses , let vs lay aside euery weight , & the sinne which doth so easily beset vs , and let vs runne with patience vnto the race that is set before vs ,
Looking vnto Iesus the Authour and finisher of our faith , who for the ioy that was set before him , endured the crosse , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
For consider him that indured such contradiction of sinners against himselfe , lest ye be wearied and faint in your mindes .
Yee haue not yet resisted vnto blood , striuing against sinne .
And ye haue forgotten the exhortation which speaketh vnto you as vnto children , My sonne , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him .
For whome the Lord loueth hee chasteneth , and scourgeth euery sonne whom he receiueth .
If yee endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sonnes : for what sonne is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
But if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sonnes .
Furthermore , wee haue had fathers of our flesh , which corrected vs , and we gaue them reuerence : shall we not much rather bee in subiection vnto the Father of Spirits , and liue ?
For they verily for a fewe dayes chastened vs after their owne pleasure , but hee for our profit , that we might bee partakers of his holinesse .
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be ioyous , but grieuous : neuerthelesse , afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruite of righteousnesse , vnto them which are exercised thereby .
Wherefore lift vp the handes which hang downe , and the feeble knees .
And make straight paths for your feete , lest that which is lame bee turned out of the way , but let it rather bee healed .
Followe peace with all men , and holinesse , without which no man shall see the Lord :
Looking diligently , lest any man faile of the grace of God , lest any roote of bitternesse springing vp , trouble you , and thereby many be defiled :
Lest there bee any fornicatour , or profane person , as Esau , who for one morsell of meat sold his birthright .
For yee know how that afterward when hee would haue inherited the blessing , hee was reiected : for hee found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with teares .
For yee are not come vnto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor vnto blacknesse , and darknes , and tempest ,
And the sound of a trumpet , and the voyce of wordes , which voyce they that heard , entreated that the word should not bee spoken to them any more .
For they could not indure that which was commaunded : And if so much as a beast touch the Mountaine , it shall be stoned , or thrust thorow with a dart .
And so terrible was the sight , that Moses sayde , I exceedingly feare , and quake .
But ye are come vnto mount Sion , and vnto the citie of the liuing God the heauenly Ierusalem , and to an innumerable company of Angels :
To the generall assembly , and Church of the first borne which are written in heauen , and to God the Iudge of all , and to the spirits of iust men made perfect :
And to Iesus the mediatour of the new Couenant , and to the blood of sprinckling , that speaketh better things then that of Abel .
See that yee refuse not him that speaketh : for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape if wee turne away from him that speaketh from heauen .
Whose voice then shooke the earth , but now he hath promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth onely , but also heauen .
And this word Yet once more , signifieth the remouing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remaine .
Let brotherly loue continue .
Bee not forgetfull to entertaine strangers , for thereby some haue entertayned Angels vnawares .
Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer aduersitie , as being your selues also in the body .
Mariage is honorable in all , and the bed vndefiled : but whoremongers , and adulterers God will iudge .
Let your conuersation bee without couetousnesse : and be content with such things as yee haue . For hee hath said , I will neuer leaue thee , nor forsake thee .
So that wee may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not feare what man shall doe vnto me .
Remember them which haue the rule ouer you , who haue spoken vnto you the word of God , whose faith follow , considering the end of their conuersation .
Iesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for euer .
Be not caried about with diuers and strange doctrines : for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace , not with meates , which haue not profited them that haue beene occupied therein .
Wee haue an altar whereof they haue no right to eate , which serue the Tabernacle .
For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the Sanctuary by the high Priest for sinne , are burnt without the campe .
Wherefore Iesus also , that hee might sanctifie the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
Let vs goe foorth therefore vnto him without the campe , bearing his reproch .
For here haue we no continuing citie , but we seeke one to come .
By him therefore let vs offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lippes , giuing thankes to his Name .
But to doe good , and to communicate forget not , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
Obey them that haue the rule ouer you , and submit your selues : for they watch for your soules , as they that must giue account , that they may doe it with ioy , and not with griefe : for that is vnprofitable for you .
Pray for vs : for we trust wee haue a good conscience in all things , willing to liue honestly .
But I beseech you the rather to doe this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
Now the God of peace , that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus , that great shepheard of the sheepe , through the blood of the euerlasting Couenant ,
Make you perfect in euery good worke to doe his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Iesus Christ , to whom be glorie for euer and euer . Amen .
And I beseech you brethren , suffer the word of exhortation , for I haue written a letter vnto you in few words .
Know yee , that our brother Timothie is set at libertie , with whom if he come shortly , I will see you .
Salute all them that haue the rule ouer you , and al the Saints . They of Italy salute you .

The word of the Lord that came vnto Hosea , the sonne of Beeri , in the dayes of Uzziah , Iotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah kings of Iudah , and in the dayes of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash king of Israel .
The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea : and the Lord sayd to Hosea , Goe , take vnto thee a wife of whoredomes , and children of whoredomes : for the land hath committed great whoredome , departing from the Lord .
So he went and tooke Gomer the daughter of Diblaim , which conceiued and bare him a sonne .
And the Lord said vnto him , Call his name Iezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will auenge the blood of Iezreel vpon the house of Iehu , and will cause to cease the kingdome of the house of Israel .
And it shall come to passe at that day , that I will breake the bow of Israel in the valley of Iezreel .
¶ And shee conceiued againe and bare a daughter , and God sayd vnto him , Call her name Lo - ruhamah : for I will no more haue mercy vpon the house of Israel : but I will vtterly take them away .
But I will haue mercy vpon the house of Iudah , and will saue them by the Lord their God , and will not saue them by vow , nor by sword , nor by battell , by horses nor by horsemen .
¶ Now when shee had weaned Lo - ruhamah , she couceiued and bare a sonne .
Then sayde God , Call his name Lo - ammi : for yee are not my people , and I will not be your God .
¶ Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which cannot bee measured nor numbred , and it shall come to passe , that in the place where it was said vnto them , Yee are not my people , there it shall be said vnto them , Ye are the sonnes of the liuing God .
<NON-VERSE>
Say ye vnto your brethren , Ammi , & to your sisters , Ruhamah :
Plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whordomes out of her sight , and her adulteries from betweene her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that shee was borne , and make her as a wildernesse , and set her like a drie land , and slay her with thirst .
And I will not haue mercy vpon her children , for they be the children of whordomes .
For their mother hath played the harlot : shee that conceiued them hath done shamefully : for shee sayd , I will goe after my louers , that giue me my bread and my water , my wooll and my flaxe , mine oyle , and my drinke .
¶ Therefore behold , I will hedge vp thy way with thornes , and make a wall , that she shall not find her pathes .
And she shall follow after her louers , but she shall not ouertake them , and she shall seeke them , but shall not find them : then shall she say , I will goe and returne to my first husband , for then was it better with me then now .
For she did not know that I gaue her corne , and wine , and oyle , and multiplied her siluer and gold , which they prepared for Baal .
Therefore will I returne , and take away my Corne in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and wil recouer my wooll and my flaxe giuen to couer her nakednesse .
And now will I discouer her lewdnesse in the sight of her louers , and none shall deliuer her out of mine hand .
I will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast daies , her new moones , and her Sabbaths , and all her solemne feasts .
And I will destroy her vines and her figge trees , whereof she hath said ; These are my rewards that my louers haue giuen me : and I will make them a forrest , and the beasts of the field shall eate them .
And I will visite vpon her the daies of Baalim , wherein she burnt incense to them , and she decked her selfe with her eare - rings , and her Iewels , and she went after her louers , and forgate me , saith the Lord .
¶ Therefore behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wildernesse , and speake comfortably vnto her .
And I wil giue her , her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a doore of hope , and she shall sing there , as in the dayes of her youth , and as in the day when she came vp out of the land of Egypt .
And it shall be at that day , saith the Lord , that thou shalt call mee Ishi ; and shalt call mee no more Baali .
For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth , & they shal no more be remembred by their name .
And in that day will I make a couenant for them with the beasts of the field , and with the foules of heauen , and with the creeping things of the ground : and I will breake the bow and the sword , and the battell out of the earth , and will make them to lie downe safely .
And I will betroth thee vnto me for euer ; yea , I will betroth thee vnto me in righteousnesse , and in iudgement , and in louing kindnesse , and in mercies .
I will euen betroth thee vnto me in faithfulnesse , and thou shalt know the Lord .
And it shall come to passe in that day , I will heare , saith the Lord , I will heare the heauens , and they shall heare the earth ,
And the earth shall heare the corne , and the wine , and the oyle , and they shall heare Iezreel .

Then said the Lord vnto me , Goe yet , loue a woman ( beloued of her friend , yet an adulteresse ) according to the loue of the Lord toward the children of Israel , who looke to other gods , and loue flagons of wine .
So I bought her to me for fifteene pieces of siluer , and for an homer of barley and an halfe homer of barley .
And I said vnto her , Thou shalt abide for me many dayes , thou shalt not play the harlot , & thou shalt not be for an other man , so will I also be for thee .
For the children of Israel shall abide many dayes without a King , and without a Prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an Ephod , and without Teraphim .
<NON-VERSE>
Heare the worde of the Lord , yee children of Israel : for the Lord hath a controuersie with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no trueth , nor mercie , nor knowledge of God in the land .
By swearing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adulterie , they breake out , and blood toucheth blood .
Therefore shall the land mourne , and euery one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beastes of the field , and with the foules of heauen , yea the fishes of the Sea also shall be taken away .
Yet let no man striue , nor reproue another : for this people are as they that striue with the priest .
Therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night , and I will destroy thy mother .
¶ My people are destroyed for lacke of knowledge : because thou hast reiected knowledge , I will also reiect thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the lawe of thy God , I wil also forget thy children .
As they were increased , so they sinned against me : therfore wil I change their glory into shame .
They eate vp the sinne of my people , and they set their heart on their iniquitie .
And there shall be like people , like priest : and I will punish them for their wayes , and reward them their doings . For they shall eate , and not haue enough : they shall commit whordome , and shall not increase , because they haue left off to take heed to the Lord .
They sacrifice vpon the tops of the mountaines , and burne incense vpon the hilles vnder okes and poplars , and elmes , because the shadowe thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredome , and your spouses shall commit adulterie .
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whordome , nor your spouses when they commit adulterie : for themselues are separated with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therfore the people that doth not vnderstand , shall fall .
¶ Though thou Israel play the harlot , yet let not Iudah offend , and come not ye vnto Gilgal , neither goe ye vp to Beth - auen , nor sweare , The Lord liueth :
For Israel slideth backe , as a backe sliding heifer : now the Lord will feede them as a lambe in a large place .
Ephraim is ioyned to idoles : let him alone .
Their drinke is sowre : they haue committed whordome continually : her rulers with shame doe loue , Giue ye .
<NON-VERSE>
Heare yee this , O priests , and hearken , ye house of Israel , and giue yee eare , O house of the king : for iudgement is toward you , because yee haue beene a snare on Mizpah , and a net spread vpon Tabor .
And the reuolters are profound to make slaughter , though I haue bene a rebuker of them all .
I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O Ephraim , thou committest whordome , and Israel is defiled .
They will not frame their doings to turne vnto their God : for the spirit of whoredomes is in the midst of them , and they haue not knowen the Lord .
And the pride of Israel doth testifie to his face : therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity : Iudah also shall fall with them .
They shall goe with their flocks , and with their heards to seeke the Lord : but they shall not finde him , he hath withdrawen himselfe from them .
They haue dealt treacherously against the Lord : for they haue begotten strange children , now shall a moneth deuoure them with their portions .
Blow yee the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah : cry alowd at Beth - auen : after thee , O Beniamin .
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel haue I made knowen that which shall surely be .
The Princes of Iudah were like them that remooue the bound : therefore I will powre out my wrath vpon them like water .
Ephraim is oppressed , and broken in iudgement : because he willingly walked after the commandement .
Therefore wil I be vnto Ephraim as a moth : and to the house of Iudah as rottennesse .
When Ephraim saw his sicknesse , and Iudah saw his wound : then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to king Iareb ; yet could he not heale you , nor cure you of your wound .
For I will bee vnto Ephraim as a Lion , and as a yong Lion to the house of Iudah : I , euen I wil teare and goe away : I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
<NON-VERSE>
Come , and let vs returne vnto the Lord : for hee hath torne , and hee will heale vs : he hath smitten , and he will binde vs vp .
After two daies will he reuiue vs , in the third day he will raise vs vp , and we shall liue in his sight .
Then shal we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared , as the morning ; & he shall come vnto vs , as the raine ; as the latter and former raine vnto the earth .
¶ O Ephraim , what shall I doe vnto thee ? O Iudah , what shall I do vnto thee ? for your goodnesse is as a morning cloud , and as the early dew it goeth away .
Therefore haue I shewed them by the Prophets : I haue slaine them by the wordes of my mouth , and thy iudgements are as the light that goeth foorth .
For I desired mercie , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of God more then burnt offerings .
But they like men haue transgressed the Couenant : there haue they dealt treacherously against me .
Gilead is a city of them that worke iniquitie ; and is polluted with blood .
And as troupes of robbers waite for a man , so the company of priestes murther in the way by consent : for they commit lewdnesse .
I haue seene an horrible thing in the house of Israel : there is the whoredome of Ephraim , Israel is defiled .
<NON-VERSE>
When I would haue healed Israel , then the iniquitie of Ephraim was discouered , and the wickednesse of Samaria : for they commit falsehood : and the thiefe commeth in , and the troupe of robbers spoileth without .
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember al their wickednesse : now their owne doings haue beset them about , they are before my face .
They make the king glad with their wickednesse , and the princes with their lies .
They are al adulterers , as an ouen heated by the baker : who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough , vntill it be leauened .
In the day of our King , the princes haue made him sicke with bottels of wine , he stretched out his hand with scorners .
For they haue made ready their heart like an ouen , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night , in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
They are all hot as an ouen , and haue deuoured their Iudges ; all their Kings are fallen , there is none among them that calleth vnto me .
Ephraim , he hath mixed himselfe among the people , Ephraim is a cake not turned .
Strangers haue deuoured his strength , and hee knoweth it not : yea , gray haires are here and there vpon him , yet he knoweth not .
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face , and they doe not returne to the Lord their God , nor seeke him for all this .
¶ Ephraim also is like a silly doue , without heart : they call to Egypt ; they goe to Assyria .
When they shall goe , I wil spread my net vpon them , I will bring them downe as the foules of the heauen : I will chastise them as their congregation hath heard .
Woe vnto them , for they haue fled from me : destruction vnto them , because they haue transgressed against me , though I haue redeemed them , yet they haue spoken lies against me .
And they haue not cryed vnto me with their heart , when they howled vpon their beds : they assemble themselues for corne and wine , and they rebell against me .
Though I haue bound , and strengthened their armes , yet doe they imagine mischiefe against me .
<NON-VERSE>
Set the Trumpet to thy mouth : hee shall come as an Eagle against the house of the Lord , because they haue transgressed my Couenant , and trespassed against my Lawe .
Israel shall crie vnto me , My God , we know thee .
Israel hath cast off the thing that is good : the enemie shall pursue him .
They haue set vp Kings , but not by me : they haue made Princes , and I knew it not : of their siluer and their golde haue they made them idoles , that they may be cut off .
¶ Thy calfe , O Samaria , hath cast thee off : mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it bee ere they attaine to innocencie ?
For from Israel was it also , the workeman made it , therefore it is not God : but the calfe of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
For they haue sowen the winde , and they shall reape the whirlewinde : it hath no stalke : the budde shall yeeld no meale : if so be it yeeld , the strangers shall swallow it vp .
Israel is swallowed vp , now shal they be among the Gentiles , as a vessell wherein is no pleasure .
For they are gone vp to Assyria , a wilde Asse alone by himselfe ; Ephraim hath hired louers .
Yea , though they haue hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the King of princes .
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sinne , altars shall be vnto him to sinne .
I haue written to him the great things of my Law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eate it ; but the Lord accepteth them not : now will he remember their iniquitie , and visite their sinnes : they shal returne to Egypt .
<NON-VERSE>
Reioyce not , O Israel , for ioy as other people : for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God , thou hast loued a reward vpon euery corne floore .
The floore and the winepresse shall not feede them , and the new wine shall faile in her .
They shal not dwel in the Lords land : but Ephraim shall returne to Egypt , and they shall eat vncleane things in Assyria .
They shall not offer wine offrings to the Lord : neither shall they be pleasing vnto him : their sacrifices shalbe vnto them as the bread of mourners : all that eate thereof shall be polluted : for their bread for their soule shall not come into the house of the Lord .
What will yee doe in the solemne day , and in the day of the feast of the Lord ?
For loe they are gone , because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them vp , Memphis shall burie them : the pleasant places for their siluer , netles shal possesse them : thornes shall be in their Tabernacles .
The dayes of visitation are come , the dayes of recompence are come , Israel shall know it ; the Prophet is a foole , the spirituall man is madde , for the multitude of thine iniquitie and the great hatred .
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the Prophet is a snare of a fouler in all his wayes , and hatred in the house of his God .
They haue deeply corrupted themselues as in the dayes of Gibeah : therefore he will remember their iniquitie , he will visite their sinnes .
I found Israel like grapes in the wildernesse : I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time : but they went to Baalpeor , and separated themselues vnto that shame , and their abominations were according as they loued .
As for Ephraim , their glory shall flee away like a bird : from the birth and from the wombe , and from the conception .
Though they bring vp their children , yet wil I bereaue them that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I depart from them .
Ephraim , as I saw Tyrus , is planted in a pleasant place : but Ephraim shall bring foorth his children to the murderer .
Giue them , O Lord : what wilt thou giue ? giue them a miscarying wombe , and drie breasts .
All their wickednesse is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for the wickednesse of their doings I will driue them out of mine house , I will loue them no more : all their princes are reuolters .
Ephraim is smitten , their roote is dried vp , they shall beare no fruite : yea though they bring foorth , yet wil I slay euen the beloued fruite of their wombe .
<NON-VERSE>
Israel is an empty vine , he bringeth forth fruite vnto himselfe : according to the multitude of his fruite , he hath increased the altars , according to the goodnesse of his land , they haue made goodly images .
Their heart is diuided : now shall they be found faultie : hee shall breake downe their altars : he shall spoile their images .
For now they shall say , We haue no King , because we feared not the Lord , What then should a King doe to vs ?
They haue spoken words , swearing falsely in making a couenant : thus iudgement springeth vp as hemlocke in the furrowes of the field .
The inhabitants of Samaria shall feare , because of the calues of Bethauen : for the people thereof shall mourne ouer it , and the priests thereof that reioyced on it , for the glory thereof , because it is departed from it .
It shall be also caried vnto Assyria for a present to King Iareb : Ephraim shall receiue shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his owne counsell .
As for Samaria , her King is cut off as the fome vpon the water .
The high places also of Auen , the sinne of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thorne and the thistle shall come vp on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountaines , Couer vs ; and to the hilles , Fall on vs .
O Israel , thou hast sinned from the dayes of Gibeah : there they stood : the battell in Gibeah against the children of iniquitie did not ouertake them .
It is in my desire that I should chastise them , and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselues in their two furrowes .
And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loueth to tread out the corne , but I passed ouer vpon her faire necke : I will make Ephraim to ride : Iudah shall plow , and Iacob shall breake his clods .
Sow to your selues in righteousnesse , reape in mercie : breake vp your fallow ground : for it is time to seeke the Lord , till he come and raine righteousnesse vpon you .
Ye haue plowed wickednesse , yee haue reaped iniquitie , ye haue eaten the fruite of lies : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mightie men .
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall bee spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth - arbel in the day of battell : the mother was dashed in pieces vpon her children .
<NON-VERSE>
When Israel was a childe , then I loued him , and called my sonne out of Egypt .
As they called them , so they went from them : they sacrificed vnto Baalim , and burnt incense to grauen images .
I taught Ephraim also to goe , taking them by their armes : but they knew not that I healed them .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of loue , and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their iawes , and I laid meat vnto them .
¶ He shall not returne into the land of Egypt ; but the Assyrian shall be his king , because they refused to returne
And the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and deuoure them , because of their own counsels .
And my people are bent to backesliding from mee : though they called them to the most High , none at all would exalt him .
How shall I giue thee vp , Ephraim ? how shall I deliuer thee , Israel ? how shall I make thee as Admah ? how shall I set thee as Zeboim ? mine heart is turned within mee , my repentings are kindled together .
I will not execute the fiercenes of mine anger , I will not returne to destroy Ephraim , for I am God , and not man , the Holy One in the midst of thee , and I will not enter into the citie .
They shal walke after the Lord : he shall roare like a lyon : when he shall roare , then the children shall tremble from the West .
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a doue out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the Lord .

¶ Hee tooke his brother by the heele in the wombe , and by his strength he had power with God .
Yea , he had power ouer the Angel and preuailed : hee wept and made supplication vnto him : he found him in Bethel , and there he spake with vs .
Euen the Lord God of hosts , the Lord is his memoriall .
Therefore turne thou to thy God : keepe mercie and iudgement , and wait on thy God continually .
¶ He is a merchant , the balances of deceit are in his hand : hee loueth to oppresse .
And Ephraim said , Yet I am become rich , I haue found mee out substance : in all my labours they shall finde none iniquitie in mee , that were sinne .
And I that am the Lord thy God from the lande of Egypt , will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the dayes of the solemne feast .
I haue also spoken by the prophets , and I haue multiplied visions , and vsed similitudes , by the ministerie of the prophets .
Is there iniquitie in Gilead ? surely they are vanitie , they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal , yea their altars are as heapes in the furrowes of the fields .

And now they sinne more and more , and haue made them molten images of their siluer , and idoles according to their owne vnderstanding , all of it the worke of the craftesmen : they say of them , Let the men that sacrifice , kisse the calues .
Therefore they shalbe as the morning cloud , and as the early dew it passeth away , as the chaffe that is driuen with a whirlewinde out of the floore , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt , and thou shalt know no God , but me : for there is no sauiour beside me .
¶ I did know thee in the wildernesse , in the land of great drought .
According to their pasture , so were they filled : they were filled , and their heart was exalted : therefore haue they forgotten me .
Therefore I will bee vnto them as a Lion , as a Leopard by the way will I obserue them .
I will meet them as a beare that is bereaued of her whelpes , and will rent the kall of their heart , and there will I deuoure them like a Lion : the wilde beast shall teare them .
¶ O Israel , thou hast destroied thy selfe , but in me is thine helpe .
I will be thy King : where is any other that may saue thee in all thy cities ? and thy Iudges of whom thou saidst , Giue me a King and Princes ?
I gaue thee a king in mine anger , and tooke him away in my wrath .
The iniquitie of Ephraim is bound vp : his sinne is hid .
The sorrowes of a traueiling woman shall come vpon him , he is an vnwise sonne , for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking foorth of children .
I will ransome them from the power of the graue : I will redeeme them from death : O death , I will be thy plagues , O graue , I will be thy destruction ; repentance shall be hid from mine eyes .

¶ I will heale their backsliding , I will loue them freely : for mine anger is turned away from him .
I wil be as the dew vnto Israel : hee shall grow as the lillie , and cast foorth his rootes as Lebanon .
His branches shall spread , and his beautie shalbe as the oliue tree , and his smell as Lebanon .
They that dwell vnder his shadow shall returne : they shall reuiue as the corne , & grow as the vine , the sent thereof shalbe as the wine of Lebanon .

¶ Heare the word of the Lord , ye rulers of Sodom , giue eare vnto the Law of our God , yee people of Gomorrah .
To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices vnto me , sayth the Lord ? I am full of the burnt offerings of rammes , and the fat of fedde beasts , and I delight not in the blood of bullockes , or of lambes , or of hee goates .
When ye come to appeare before mee , who hath required this at your hand , to tread my courts ?
Bring no more vaine oblations , incense is an abomination vnto me : the new Moones , and Sabbaths , the calling of assemblies I cannot away with ; it is iniquitie , euen the solemne meeting .
Your new Moones , and your appointed Feasts my soule hateth : they are a trouble vnto me , I am weary to beare them .

And it shall come to passe in the last dayes , that the mountaine of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountaines , and shall be exalted aboue the hilles ; and all nations shall flow vnto it .
And many people shall goe & say ; Come yee and let vs go vp to the mountaine of the Lord , to the house of the God of Iacob , and he will teach vs of his wayes , and we will walke in his pathes : for out of Zion shall goe forth the lawe , and the word of the Lord from Ierusalem .

¶ Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Iacob ; because they be replenished from the East , and are soothsayers like the Philistines , and they please themselues in the children of strangers .
Their land also is full of siluer and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures : their land is also full of horses ; neither is there any end of their charets .
Their land also is full of idoles : they worship the worke of their owne hands , that which their owne fingers haue made .
And the meane man boweth downe , and the great man humbleth himselfe ; therefore forgiue them not .
¶ Enter into the rocke , and hide thee in the dust , for feare of the Lord , and for the glory of his Maiestie .
The loftie lookes of man shalbe humbled , and the hautines of men shalbe bowed downe : and the Lord alone shalbe exalted in that day .
And vpon all the high mountaines , and vpon all the hilles that are lifted vp ,
And vpon euery high tower , and vpon euery fenced wall ,
And vpon all the ships of Tarshish , and vpon all pleasant pictures .
And the loftinesse of man shall be bowed downe , and the hautinesse of men shalbe made low : and the Lord alone shalbe exalted in that day .
And the idoles hee shall vtterly abolish .
And they shall goe into the holes of the rocks , and into the caues of the earth for feare of the Lord , and for the glory of his Maiestie ; when hee ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
In that day a man shall cast his idoles of siluer , and his idoles of golde which they made each one for himselfe to worship , to the moules and to the battes :
To go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rockes , for feare of the Lord , and for the glorie of his Maiestie ; when hee ariseth to shake terribly the earth .

Woe vnto the wicked , it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his handes shalbe giuen him .
¶ As for my people , children are their oppressours , and women rule ouer them : O my people , they which lead thee , cause thee to erre , and destroy the way of thy paths .
The Lord standeth vp to plead , and standeth to iudge the people .
The Lord will enter into iudgement with the ancients of his people , and the Princes thereof : for ye haue eaten vp the Uineyard ; the spoile of the poore is in your houses .
What meane yee that yee beat my people to pieces , and grinde the faces of the poore , saith the Lord God of hosts ? ¶ Moreouer the Lord saith ; Because the daughters of Zion are hautie , and walke with stretched forth necks , and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they goe , and making a tinkeling with their feet :
Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crowne of the head of the daughters of Zion , and the Lord will discouer their secret parts .
The rings , and nose - iewels , The changeable sutes of apparell , and the mantles , and the wimples , and the crisping pinnes ,
The glasses , and the fine linnen , and the hoods , and the vailes .
And it shall come to passe , that in steade of sweete smell , there shall bee stinke ; and in stead of a girdle , a rent ; and in stead of well set haire , baldnesse ; and in stead of a stomacher , a girding of sackecloth ; and burning , in stead of beautie .
Thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mightie in the warre .

And in that day seuen women shall take hold of one man , saying , We will eate our owne bread , & weare our owne apparell : onely let vs be called by thy name , to take away our reproch .
In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautifull and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shalbe excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel .
And it shall come to passe , that hee that is left in Zion , and hee that remaineth in Ierusalem , shall be called Holy , euen euery one that is written among the liuing in Ierusalem ,
When the Lord shall haue washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall haue purged the blood of Ierusalem from the middest thereof , by the spirit of iudgement , and by the spirit of burning .
And the Lord will create vpon euery dwelling place of mount Zion , and vpon her assemblies a cloude , and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night ; for vpon all the glory shall be a defence .

Now will I sing to my welbeloued , a song of my beloued touching his vineyard : my wellbeloued hath a vineyard in a very fruitfull hill .
And hee fenced it , and gathered out the stones thereof , and planted it with the choicest vine , and built a towre in the middest of it , and also made a winepresse therein : and he looked that it should bring foorth grapes , and it brought foorth wilde grapes .
And now , O inhabitants of Ierusalem , and men of Iudah , Iudge , I pray you , betwixt me and my Uineyard .
What could haue beene done more to my Uineyard , that I haue not done in it ? wherefore when I looked that it should bring foorth grapes , brought it foorth wilde grapes ?
And now goe to ; I will tell you what I will doe to my Uineyard , I will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eaten vp ; and breake downe the wall thereof , and it shall be troden downe .
And I will lay it waste ; it shall not be pruned , nor digged , but there shall come vp briars and thornes : I will also command the cloudes , that they raine no raine vpon it .
For the Uineyard of the Lord of hostes is the house of Israel , and the men of Iudah his pleasant plant : and he looked for iudgement , but beholde oppression ; for righteousnesse , but behold a crie .
¶ Woe vnto them that ioyne house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth .
In mine eares said the Lord of hostes , Of a trueth many houses shall be desolate , euen great and faire without inhabitant .
Yea ten acres of vineyard shall yeeld one Bath , and the seed of an Homer shall yeeld an Ephah .
¶ Woe vnto them that rise vp earely in the morning , that they may follow strong drink , that continue vntill night , till wine enflame them .
And the harpe and the viole , the tabret and pipe , and wine are in their feasts : but they regard not the worke of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
¶ Therefore my people are gone into captiuitie , because they haue no knowledge : and their honourable men are famished , aud their multitude dried vp with thirst .
Therefore hell hath enlarged her selfe , and opened her mouth without measure : and their glory , and their multitude , and their pompe , and hee that reioyceth , shall descend into it .
And the meane man shall bee brought downe , and the mightie man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the loftie shall be humbled .
But the Lord of hosts shalbe exalted in iudgement , and God that is holy , shall bee sanctified in righteousnesse .
Then shall the lambes feed after their maner , and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eate .
Woe vnto them that draw iniquitie with cords of vanitie , and sinne , as it were with a cart rope :
That say , Let him make speede , and hasten his worke , that we may see it : and let the counsell of the holy one of Israel draw nigh and come , that wee may know it .
¶ Woe vnto them that call euill good , and good euill , that put darkenes for light , and light for darkenesse , that put bitter for sweete , and sweete for bitter .
Woe vnto them that are wise in their owne eyes , and prudent in their owne sight .
Woe vnto them that are mightie to drinke wine , and men of strength to mingle strong drinke .
Which iustifie the wicked for reward , and take away the righteousnes of the righteous from him .
Therfore as the fire deuoureth the stubble , and the flame consumeth the chaffe , so their root shall be rottennes , and their blossome shall goe vp as dust : because they haue cast away the Lawe of the Lord of hosts , and despised the worde of the Holy One of Israel .
Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people , and he hath stretched foorth his hande against them , and hath smitten them : and the hilles did tremble , and their carkeises were torne in the midst of the streets : for all this , his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
¶ And he will lift vp an ensigne to the nations from farre , and wil hisse vnto them from the end of the earth : and behold , they shall come with speed swiftly .
None shalbe weary , nor stumble amongst them : none shall slumber nor sleepe , neither shall the girdle of their loynes be loosed , nor the latchet of their shooes be broken .
Whose arrowes are sharpe , and all their bowes bent , their horses hoofs shall bee counted like flint , and their wheeles like a whirlewind .
Their roaring shalbe like a lyon , they shall roare like yong lions : yea they shal roare and lay hold of the pray , and shall carie it away safe , and none shall deliuer it .

In the yeere that King Uzziah died , I saw also the Lord sitting vpon a throne , high and lifted vp , and his traine filled the Temple .
Aboue it stood the Seraphims : each one had sixe wings , with twaine he couered his face , and with twaine hee couered his feete , and with twaine hee did flie .
And one cryed vnto another , and sayd ; Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord of hostes , the whole earth is full of his glory .
And the posts of the doore moued at the voyce of him that cryed , and the house was filled with smoke .
¶ Then sayd I ; woe is me ; for I am vndone , because I am a man of vncleane lippes , and I dwell in the midst of a people of vncleane lippes : for mine eyes haue seene the king , the Lord of hostes .
Then flew one of the Seraphims vnto mee , hauing a liue - cole in his hand , which hee had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
And he laide it vpon my mouth , and sayd , Loe , this hath touched thy lippes , and thine iniquitie is taken away , and thy sinne purged .
Also I heard the voyce of the Lord , saying ; Whom shall I send , and who will goe for vs ? Then I saide ; Heere am I , send me .
¶ And he sayd , Goe and tell this people ; Heare yee indeede , but vnderstand not : and see yee indeed , but perceiue not .
Make the heart of this people fat , and make their eares heauy , and shut their eyes : lest they see with their eyes , and heare with their eares , and vnderstand with their heart , and conuert and be healed .
Then sayd I ; Lord , how long ? And hee answered , Untill the cities be wasted without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land be vtterly desolate ,
And the Lord haue remoued men farre away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .

And it came to passe in the dayes of Ahaz the sonne of Iotham , the sonne of Uzziah king of Iudah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah , the sonne of Remaliah king of Israel , went vp towards Ierusalem to warre against it , but could not preuaile against it .
And it was told the house of Dauid , saying , Syria is confederate with Ephraim : and his heart was moued , and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are mooued with the wind .
Then sayd the Lord vnto Isaiah ; Goe forth now to meete Ahaz , thou , & Shear - iashub thy sonne , at the end of the conduit of the vpper poole in the high way of the fullers field .
And say vnto him ; Take heede and be quiet : feare not , neither be faint hearted for the two tailes of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria , and of the sonne of Remaliah .
Because Syria , Ephraim , and the sonne of Remaliah haue taken euill counsell against thee , saying ;
Let vs goe vp against Iudah and vexe it , and let vs make a breach therein for vs , and set a king in the midst of it , euen the sonne of Tabeal .
Thus saith the Lord God ; It shall not stand , neither shall it come to passe .
For the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is Rezin , and within threescore and fiue yeeres shall Ephraim be broken , that it be not a people .
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs sonne : if yee will not beleeue , surely yee shall not be established .
¶ Moreouer the Lord spake againe vnto Ahaz , saying ;
Aske thee a signe of the Lord thy God ; aske it either in the depth , or in the height aboue .
But Ahaz sayd , I will not aske , neither will I tempt the Lord .
And he sayd ; Heare yee now , O house of Dauid ; Is it a small thing for you to wearie men , but will yee wearie my God also ?
Therefore the Lord himselfe shal giue you a signe : Behold , a Uirgine shall conceiue and beare a Sonne , and shall call his name Immanuel .
Butter and hony shall he eat , that hee may know to refuse the euill , and choose the good .
For before the childe shall know to refuse the euill and choose the good ; the land that thou abhorrest , shalbe forsaken of both her kings .

And it shall come to passe in that day , that the Lord shall hisse for the flie , that is in the vttermost part of the riuers of Egypt , and for the Bee that is in the land of Assyria .
And they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rockes , and vpon all thornes , and vpon all bushes .
In the same day shall the Lord shaue with a rasor that is hired , namely by them beyond the riuer , by the king of Assyria , the head , and the haire of the feet : and it shal also consume the beard .
And it shall come to passe in that day , that a man shal nourish a yong cow and two sheepe .
And it shall come to passe , for the abundance of milke that they shall giue , he shal eate butter : for butter and hony shall euery one eate , that is left in the land .

For before the childe shall haue knowledge to cry , My father and my mother , the riches of Damascus , and the spoile of Samaria shalbe taken away before the king of Assyria .

Say ye not , A confederacie to all them , to whom this people shall say , A confederacie ; neither feare yee their feare , nor be afraid .
Sanctifie the Lord of hostes himselfe , and let him bee your feare , and let him be your dread .
And he shalbe for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rocke of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a ginne , and for a snare to the inhabitants of Ierusalem .

¶ And when they shall say vnto you ; Seeke vnto them that haue familiar spirits , and vnto wizards that peepe and that mutter : should not a people seeke vnto their God ? for the liuing , to the dead ?
To the Law and to the Testimonie : if they speake not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
Neuerthelesse the dimnesse shall not be such as was in her vexation ; when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun , and the land of Naphtali , and afterward did more grieuously afflict her by the way of the Sea , beyond Iordan in Galile of the nations .
The people that walked in darknesse , haue seene a great light : they that dwel in the land of the shadow of death , vpon them hath the light shined .
Thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the ioy : they ioy before thee , according to the ioy in haruest , and as men reioyce when they diuide the spoile .

Therefore the Lord shall set vp the aduersaries of Rezin against him , and ioyne his enemies together .

Therfore the Lord shall haue no ioy in their yong men , neither shall haue mercy on their fatherlesse & widowes : for euery one is an hypocrite , and an euil doer , and euery mouth speaketh folly : for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .

Shall the axe boast it selfe against him that heweth therewith ? Or shal the sawe magnifie it selfe against him that shaketh it ? as if the rod should shake it selfe against them that lift it vp , or as if the staffe should lift vp it selfe , as if it were no wood .
Therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his fat ones leannesse , and vnder his glory hee shall kindle a burning , like the burning of a fire .
And the light of Israel shall bee for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burne and deuoure his thornes and his briers in one day :

They that see thee shal narrowly looke vpon thee , and consider thee , saying ; Is this the man that made the earth to tremble , that did shake kingdomes ?
That made the world as a wildernesse , and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners ?
All the kings of the nations , euen all of them lie in glory , euery one in his owne house .
But thou art cast out of thy graue , like an abominable branch : and as the raiment of those that are slaine , thrust through with a sword , that goe downe to the stones of the pit , as a carkeis troden vnder feete .
Thou shalt not be ioyned with them in buriall , because thou hast destroyed thy land , and slaine thy people : the seede of euill doers shall neuer be renowmed .
Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquitie of their fathers , that they doe not rise nor possesse the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
For I will rise vp against them , sayth the Lord of hostes , and cut off from Babylon the name , and remnant , and sonne and nephew , sayth the Lord .
I will also make it a possession for the Bitterne , and pooles of water : and I will sweepe it with the besome of destruction , sayth the Lord of hostes .
¶ The Lord of hostes hath sworne , saying ; Surely as I haue thought , so shall it come to passe ; and as I haue purposed , so shall it stand :
That I will breake the Assyrian in my land , and vpon my mountaines tread him vnder foote : then shall his yoke depart from off them , and his burden depart from off their shoulders .
This is the purpose , that is purposed vpon the whole earth : and this is the hand that is stretched out vpon all the nations .
For the Lord of hostes hath purposed , and who shall disanull it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turne it backe ?
In the yeere that king Ahaz died , was this burden .
¶ Reioyce not thou whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpents roote shall come foorth a cockatrice , and his fruite shall be a fierie flying serpent .
And the first borne of the poore shall feed , and the needy shall lie downe in safetie : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall slay thy remnant .
Howle , O gate , crie , O citie , thou whole Palestina art dissolued , for there shal come from the North a smoke , and none shall bee alone in his appointed times .

The burden of Moab : because in the night Ar of Moab is laide waste and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laide waste , and brought to silence :
Hee is gone vp to Baijth , and to Dibon , the high places , to weepe : Moab shall howle ouer Nebo , and ouer Medeba , on all their heads shalbe baldnesse , and euery beard cut off .
In their streetes they shall girde themselues with sackecloth : on the toppes of their houses , and in their streetes euery one shall howle , weeping abundantly .
And Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shalbe heard euen vnto Iahaz : therefore the armed souldiers of Moab shall crie out , his life shall be grieuous vnto him .
My heart shall cry out for Moab ; his fugitiues shall flee vnto Zoar , an heifer of three yeeres olde : for by the mounting vp of Luhith with weeping shall they goe it vp : for in the way of Horonaim , they shall raise vp a crie of destruction .
For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate : for the hay is withered away , the grasse faileth , there is no greene thing .
Therefore the abundance they haue gotten , and that which they haue laide vp , shall they cary away to the brooke of the willowes .
For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab : the howling thereof vnto Eglaim , and the howling thereof vnto Beer - Elim .

Send ye the lambe to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wildernesse , vnto the mount of the daughter of Zion .
For it shalbe that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest : so the daughters of Moab shalbe at the fordes of Arnon .
Take counsell , execute Iudgement , make thy shadow as the night in the middest of the nooneday , hide the outcastes , bewray not him that wandereth .
Let mine outcasts dwel with thee , Moab , be thou a couert to them from the face of the spoiler : for the extortioner is at an end , the spoiler ceaseth , the oppressours are consumed out of the land .
And in mercy shall the throne be established , and hee shal sit vpon it in trueth , in the tabernacle of Dauid , iudging and seeking iudgement , and hasting righteousnesse .
¶ We haue heard of the pride of Moab ( hee is very proud ) euen of his hautines , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
Therefore shall Moab howle for Moab , euery one shal howle : for the foundations of Kir - hareseth shall yee mourne , surely they are stricken .
For the fieldes of Heshbon languish , and the vine of Sibmah , the lords of the heathen haue broken downe the principall plants thereof , they are come euen vnto Iazer , they wandred through the wildernesse , her branches are stretched out , they are gone ouer the sea .
¶ Therefore I wil bewaile with the weeping of Iazer , the Uine of Sibmah I wil water thee with my teares , O Heshbon , and Elealeh : for the shouting for thy Summer fruits , and for thy haruest , is fallen .
And gladnesse is taken away , and ioy out of the plentifull field , and in the Uineyards there shalbe no singing , neither shal there be shouting : the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses ; I haue made their vintage shouting to cease .
Wherefore my bowels shal sound like an harpe for Moab , and mine inward parts for Kir - haresh .
¶ And it shal come to passe , when it is seene that Moab is weary on the high place , that hee shall come to his Sanctuary to pray : but hee shall not preuaile .
This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning Moab since that time .

The burden of Damascus : Behold , Damascus is taken away from being a citie , and it shalbe a ruinous heape .

And it shall be as when the haruest - man gathereth the corne , and reapeth the eares with his arme ; and it shalbe as he that gathereth eares in the valley of Rephaim .
And hee shall not looke to the altars , the worke of his handes , neither shall respect that which his fingers haue made , either the groues or the images . )
¶ In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough , and an vppermost branch , which they left , because of the children of Israel : and there shalbe desolation .
Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy saluation , and hast not beene mindfull of the rocke of thy strength : therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants , and shalt set it with strange slips .
In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make thy seede to flourish : but the haruest shall be a heape in the day of griefe , and of desperate sorrow . ¶ Woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise , like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing , like the rushing of mighty waters .
The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee farre off , and shalbe chased as the chaffe of the mountaines before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlewind .

All yee inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see yee , when hee lifteth vp an ensigne on the mountaines ; and when he bloweth a trumpet , heare yee .
For so the Lord sayd vnto me : I will take my rest , and I will consider in my dwelling place like a cleare heate vpon herbes , and like a cloud of dew in the heate of haruest .
For afore the haruest when the bud is perfect , and the sowre grape is ripening in the flowre ; hee shall both cut off the sprigges with pruning hookes , and take away and cut downe the branches .
They shalbe left together vnto the foules of the mountaines , and to the beasts of the earth : and the foules shall summer vpon them , and all the beastes of the earth shall winter vpon them .

The burden of Egypt : Behold , the Lord rideth vpon a swift cloude , and shall come into Egypt , and the idoles of Egypt shalbe moued at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight euery one against his brother , and euery one against his neighbour ; citie against citie , and kingdome against kingdome .
And the spirit of Egypt shall faile in the midst thereof , and I will destroy the counsell thereof : and they shall seeke to the idoles , and to the charmers , and to them that haue familiar spirits , and to the wizards .
And the Egyptians will I giue ouer into the hand of a cruell Lord ; and a fierce king shall rule ouer them , saith the Lorde , the Lord of hostes .
And the waters shall faile from the sea , and the riuer shalbe wasted , and dried vp .
And they shall turne the riuers farre away , and the brookes of defence shall be emptied and dried vp : the reeds and flagges shall wither .
The paper reeds by the brookes , by the mouth of the brookes , and euery thing sowen by the brooks shal wither , be driuen away , and be no more .
The fishers also shall mourne , and all they that cast angle into the brookes shall lament , and they that spread nets vpon the waters shall languish .
Moreouer they that worke in fine flaxe , and they that weaue net - works shall be confounded .
And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof , all that make sluces and ponds for fish .
¶ Surely the princes of Zoan are fooles , the counsell of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish : How say ye vnto Pharaoh , I am the sonne of the wise , the sonne of ancient kings ?
Where are they ? Where are thy wise men ? and let them tell thee now , and let them know , what the Lord of hosts hath purposed vpon Egypt .
The princes of Zoan are become fooles , the princes of Noph are deceiued , they haue also seduced Egypt , euen they that are the stay of the tribes thereof .
The Lord hath mingled a peruerse spirit in the midst thereof : and they haue caused Egypt to erre in euery worke thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit .
Neither shall there be any worke for Egypt , which the head or taile , branch or rush may doe .
In that day shall Egypt bee like vnto women : and it shall be afraid and feare , because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shaketh ouer it .
And the land of Iudah shall bee a terrour vnto Egypt , euery one that maketh mention thereof , shal be afraid in himselfe , because of the counsell of the Lord of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
¶ In that day shall fiue cities in the land of Egypt speake the language of Canaan , and sweare to the Lord of hostes : one shalbe called the citie of destruction .
In that day shall there be an Altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord .
And it shall be for a signe , and for a witnesse vnto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt : for they shall crie vnto the Lord , because of the oppressours , and he shal send them a Sauiour and a great One , and he shall deliuer them .
And the Lord shalbe knowen to Egypt , and the Egyptians shal know the Lord in that day , and shal do sacrifice and oblation , yea they shall vow a vowe vnto the Lord , and performe it .
And the Lord shall smite Egypt , he shall smite and heale it , and they shall returne euen to the Lord , and he shalbe intreated of them , and shall heale them .
¶ In that day shall there be a hie way out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria , and the Egyptians shall serue with the Assyrians .

At the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the sonne of Amoz , saying , Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loynes , and put off thy shooe from thy foot : and he did so , walking naked and bare foot .
And the Lord said , Like as my seruant Isaiah hath walked naked and bare foote three yeeres for a signe and wonder vpon Egypt and vpon Ethiopia :
So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners , and the Ethiopians captiues , yong and old , naked and bare foote , euen with their buttocks vncouered , to the shame of Egypt .
And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation , and of Egypt their glory .

The burden of the desert of the sea . As whirlewinds in the South passe thorough ; so it commeth from the desert , from a terrible land .
A grieuous vision is declared vnto me ; The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously , and the spoiler spoileth : Goe , vp O Elam : besiege , O Media : all the sighing thereof haue I made to cease . Therefore are my loynes filled with paine , pangs haue taken hold vpon me , as the pangs of a woman that trauelleth : I was bowed downe at the hearing of it , I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
My heart panted , fearefulnesse affrighted me : the night of my pleasure hath he turned into feare vnto me .
Prepare the table , watch in the watch - tower , eate , drinke : arise yee princes , and anoint the shield .
For thus hath the Lord sayd vnto me ; Goe , set a watchman , let him declare what he seeth .
And he saw a charet with a couple of horsemen , a charet of asses , and a charet of camels ; and hee hearkened diligently with much heede .
And he cryed ; A lyon : my Lord , I stand continually vpon the watch - tower in the day time , and I am set in my ward whole nights .
And behold , heere commeth a charet of men with a couple of horsemen : and he answered and sayd ; Babylon is fallen , is fallen , and all the grauen images of her Gods he hath broken vnto the ground .
O my threshing and the corne of my floore : that which I haue heard of the Lord of hostes the God of Israel , haue I declared vnto you .
¶ The burden of Dumah . Hee calleth to me out of Seir : Watchman , what of the night ? Watchman , what of the night ?

¶ The burden vpon Arabia . In the forest in Arabia shall yee lodge , O yee trauelling companies of Dedanim .
The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty , they preuented with their bread him that fled .
For they fled from the swords , from the drawen sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grieuousnesse of warre .
For thus hath the Lord sayd vnto me : Within a yeere , according to the yeeres of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall faile .

Thou that art full of stirres , a tumultuous citie , a ioyous citie : thy slaine men are not slaine with the sword , nor dead in battell .
All thy rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which haue fled from farre .
Therefore sayd I ; Looke away from me , I will weepe bitterly , labour not to comfort me ; because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people .
For it is a day of trouble , and of treading downe , and of perplexitie by the Lord God of hostes in the valley of vision , breaking downe the walles , and of crying to the mountaines .
And Elam bare the quiuer with charets of men and horsemen , and Kir vncouered the shield .
And it shall come to passe that thy choicest valleys shall be full of charets , and the horsemen shall set themselues in aray at the gate .
¶ And he discouered the couering of Iudah , and thou diddest looke in that day to the armour of the house of the forrest .
Ye haue seene also the breaches of the citie of Dauid , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower poole .
And ye haue numbred the houses of Ierusalem , and the houses haue yee broken downe to fortifie the wall .
Ye made also a ditch betweene the two walles , for the water of the olde poole : but ye haue not looked vnto the maker thereof , neither had respect vnto him that fashioned it long agoe .
And in that day did the Lord God of hostes call to weeping and to mourning , and to baldnesse , and to girding with sackecloth .
And behold ioy and gladnesse , slaying oxen and killing sheep , eating flesh , and drinking wine ; let vs eate and drinke , for to morrow we shall die .
And it was reuealed in mine eares by the Lord of hostes ; surely this iniquitie shall not be purged from you , till yee die , sayth the Lord God of hostes .
¶ Thus sayth the Lord God of hostes , Goe , get thee vnto this treasurer , euen vnto Shebna , which is ouer the house , and say ;
What hast thou here ? And whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as hee that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graueth an habitation for himselfe in a rocke ?
Behold ; the Lord will cary thee away with a mightie captiuitie , and will surely couer thee .
He will surely violently turne and tosse thee , like a ball into a large countrey : there shalt thou die , and there the charets of thy glory shall be the shame of thy Lords house .
And I will driue thee from thy station , and from thy state shall he pull thee downe .
¶ And it shall come to passe in that day , that I will call my seruant Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah :
And I will clothe him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy girdle , and I wil commit thy gouernment into his hand , and he shalbe a father to the inhabitants of Ierusalem , and to the house of Iudah .
And the key of the house of Dauid will I lay vpon his shoulder : so he shall open and none shall shut , and he shall shut and none shall open .
And I will fasten him as a naile in asure place , and he shalbe for a glorious throne to his fathers house .
And they shall hang vpon him all the glory of his fathers house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantitie : from the vessels of cups , euen to all the vessels of flagons .

And by great waters the seede of Sihor , the haruest of the riuer is her reuenew , and she is a mart of nations .
Be thou ashamed , O Zidon ; for the sea hath spoken , euen the strength of the sea , saying ; I trauell not , nor bring foorth children , neither doe I nourish vp yong men , nor bring vp virgines .
As at the report concerning Egypt , so shal they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre .
Passe ye ouer to Tarshish , howle ye inhabitants of the yle .
Is this your ioyous citie , whose antiquitie is of ancient dayes ? her owne feete shall cary her afarre off to soiourne .
Who hath taken this counsell against Tyre the crowning citie , whose merchants are princes , whose traffiquers are the honourable of the earth ?
The Lord of hostes hath purposed it , to staine the pride of all glory , and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth .
Passe through thy land as a riuer O daughter of Tarshish : there is no more strength .
He stretched out his hand ouer the sea , hee shooke the kingdomes : the Lord hath giuen a commandement against the merchant citie , to destroy the strong holdes thereof .
And he said , Thou shalt no more reioice , O thou oppressed virgin , daughter of Zidon : arise , passe ouer to Chittim , there also shalt thou haue no rest .
Behold , the land of the Caldeans , this people was not till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwel in the wildernesse : they set vp the towers thereof , they raised vp the palaces thereof , and he brought it to ruine .
Howle ye ships of Tarshish : for your strength is laid waste .
And it shall come to passe in that day , that Tyre shall be forgotten seuentie yeeres according to the dayes of one king : after the end of seuentie yeeres shall Tyre sing as an harlot .
Take an harpe , goe about the city thou harlot , that hast beene forgotten , make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembred .

The land shall be vtterly emptied , and vtterly spoiled : for the Lord hath spoken this word .
The earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughtie people of the earth doe languish .
The earth also is defiled vnder the inhabitants thereof : because they haue transgressed the lawes , changed the ordinance , broken the euerlasting couenant .
Therefore hath the curse deuoured the earth , and they that dwell therin are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
The new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merrie hearted doe sigh .
The mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that reioyce , endeth , the ioy of the harpe ceaseth .
They shall not drinke wine with a song , strong drinke shall bee bitter to them that drinke it .
The city of confusion is broken downe : euery house is shut vp , that no man may come in .
There is a crying for wine in the streets , all ioy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
In the citie is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
¶ When thus it shalbe in the midst of the land among the people : there shall be as the shaking of an oliue tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
They shal lift vp their voice , they shal sing , for the maiesty of the Lord , they shall crie aloud from the sea .
Wherefore , glorifie ye the Lord in the fires , euen the Name of the Lord God of Israel in the yles of the Sea .
¶ From the vttermost part of the earth haue we heard songs , euen glory to the righteous : but I said , My leannesse , my leannesse , woe vnto me : the treacherous dealers haue dealt treacherously , yea the treacherous dealers haue dealt very treacherously .
Feare , and the pit , & the snare are vpon thee , O inhabitant of the earth .
And it shall come to passe , that he who fleeth from the noise of the feare , shall fall into the pit ; and he that commeth vp out of the midst of the pit , shalbe taken in the snare : for the windowes from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth doe shake .
The earth is vtterly broken downe , the earth is cleane dissolued , the earth is moued exceedingly .
The earth shall reele to and fro , like a drunkard , and shall be remooued like a cottage , and the transgression thereof shall be heauie vpon it , and it shall fall , and not rise againe .
And it shall come to passe in that day , that the Lord shall punish the hoste of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth vpon the earth .

O Lord , thou art my God , I will exalt thee , I will praise thy Name ; for thou hast done wonderfull things ; thy counsels of old are faithfulnesse and trueth .
For thou hast made of a citie , an heape ; of a defenced city , a ruine : a palace of strangers , to be no citie , it shall neuer be built .
Therefore shall the strong people glorifie thee , the city of the terrible nations shall feare thee .
For thou hast bene a strength to the poore , a strength to the needy in his distresse , a refuge from the storme , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storme against the wall .
Thou shalt bring downe the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; euen the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible ones shalbe brought low .
¶ And in this mountaine shall the Lord of hostes make vnto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
And he wil destroy in this mountaine the face of the couering cast ouer all people , and the vaile that is spread ouer all nations .
He will swallow vp death in victorie , and the Lord God wil wipe away teares from off al faces , and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the Lord hath spoken it .
¶ And it shalbe said in that day , Loe , this is our God , we haue waited for him , and he will saue vs : this is the Lord , we haue waited for him , we wil be glad , and reioyce in his saluation .
For in this mountaine shall the hand of the Lord rest , and Moab shalbe troden downe vnder him , euen as straw is troden downe for the dounghill .

Trust ye in the Lord for euer : for in the Lord Iehouah is euerlasting strength .

The foote shall treade it downe , euen the feete of the poore , and the steps of the needie .
The way of the iust is vprightnesse : thou most vpright , doest weigh the path of the iust .
Yea in the way of thy Iudgements , O Lord , haue we waited for thee ; the desire of our soule is to thy Name , and to the remembrance of thee .
With my soule haue I desired thee in the night , yea with my spirit within me will I seeke thee early : for when thy iudgements are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learne righteousnesse .
Let fauour be shewed to the wicked , yet will hee not learne righteousnesse : in the land of vprightnesse will he deale vniustly , and will not behold the maiestie of the Lord .
Lord , when thy hand is lifted vp , they will not see : but they shall see , and be ashamed for their enuie at the people , yea the fire of thine enemies shall deuoure them .
¶ Lord , thou wilt ordaine peace for vs : for thou also hast wrought all our workes in vs .
O Lord our God , other lordes besides thee haue had dominion ouer vs : but by thee only will we make mention of thy Name .
They are dead , they shall not liue ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
Thou hast increased the nation , O Lord , thou hast increased the nation , thou art glorified ; thou hadst remooued it farre vnto all the ends of the earth .
Lord , in trouble haue they visited thee : they powred out a prayer when thy chastening was vpon them .
Like as a woman with childe that draweth neere the time of her deliuerie , is in paine and cryeth out in her pangs ; so haue wee beene in thy sight , O Lord .
Wee haue beene with childe , wee haue beene in paine , we haue as it were brought foorth winde , wee haue not wrought any deliuerance in the earth , neither haue the inhabitants of the world fallen .

Furie is not in mee : who would set the briars and thornes against me in battell ? I would goe through them , I would burne them together .
Or let him take holde of my strength , that he may make peace with me , and he shall make peace with me .
Hee shall cause them that come of Iacob to take roote : Israel shall blossome and budde , and fill the face of the world with fruite .
¶ Hath hee smitten him , as hee smote those that smote him ? or is hee slaine according to the slaughter of them that are slaine by him ?
In measure when it shooteth foorth , thou wilt debate with it : hee stayeth his rough winde in the day of the East winde .
By this therefore shall the iniquitie of Iacob be purged , and this is all the fruit , to take away his sinne : when he maketh all the stones of the Altar as chalke stones , that are beaten in sunder , the groues and images shall not stand vp .
Yet the defenced citie shall be desolate , and the habitation forsaken , and left like a wildernesse : there shall the calfe feede , and there shall he lie downe , and consume the branches thereof .
When the boughes thereof are withered , they shall be broken off : the women come and set them on fire : for it is a people of no vnderstanding : therefore hee that made them will not haue mercie on them , and hee that formed them , will shewe them no fauour .

And for a spirit of iudgement to him that sitteth in iudgement , and for strength to them that turne the battell to the gate .
¶ But they also haue erred through wine , and through strong drinke are out of the way : the priest and the prophet haue erred through strong drinke , they are swallowed vp of wine : they are out of the way through strong drinke , they erre in vision , they stumble in iudgement .
For all tables are full of vomite and filthinesse , so that there is no place cleane .
¶ Whome shall he teach knowledge ? and whom shall he make to vnderstand doctrine ? them that are weaned from the milke , and drawen from the breasts .
For precept must be vpon precept , precept vpon precept , line vpon line , line vpon line , here a litle , and there a litle .
For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speake to this people .
To whom he said , This is the rest wherwith ye may cause the weary to rest , and this is the refreshing , yet they would not heare .
But the word of the Lord was vnto them , precept vpon precept , precept vpon precept , line vpon line , line vpon line , here a litle and there a litle : that they might goe and fall backward , and be broken , and snared , and taken .
¶ Wherefore heare the worde of the Lord , yee scornefull men , that rule this people which is in Ierusalem .
Because ye haue said , Wee haue made a couenant with death , and with hell are we at agreement , when the ouerflowing scourge shall passe thorow , it shall not come vnto vs : for wee haue made lies our refuge , and vnder falsehood haue we hid our selues :
¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Beholde , I lay in Zion for a foundation , a stone , a tryed stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : hee that beleeueth , shall not make haste .
Iudgement also will I lay to the line , and righteousnesse to the plummet : and the haile shall sweepe away the refuge of lyes , and the waters shall ouerflow the hiding place .
¶ And your couenant with death shalbe disanulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the ouerflowing scourge shall passe thorough , then yee shalbe troden downe by it .
From the time that it goeth forth , it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it passe ouer , by day and by night , and it shalbe a vexation , onely to vnderstand the report .
For the bed is shorter , then that a man can stretch himselfe on it : and the couering narrower , then that he can wrap himselfe in it .
For the Lord shall rise vp as in mount Perazim , he shalbe wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may doe his worke , his strange worke ; and bring to passe his act , his strange act .
Now therefore be yee not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for I haue heard from the Lord God of hostes a consumption euen determined vpon the whole earth .
¶ Giue yee eare , and heare my voyce , hearken and heare my speach .
Doth the plowman plow all day to sow ? doth he open and breake the clods of his ground ?
When hee hath made plaine the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the fitches , and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principall wheate , and the appointed barly and the rye in their place ?
For his God doth instruct him to discretion , and doth teach him .
For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheele turned about vpon the cummin : but the fitches are beaten out with a staffe , and the cummin with a rodde .
Bread corne is bruised ; because he will not euer be threshing it , nor breake it with the wheele of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .

Woe to Ariel , to Ariel the citie where Dauid dwelt : adde yee yeere to yeere ; let them kill sacrifices .
Yet I will distresse Ariel , and there shalbe heauinesse and sorrow ; and it shall be vnto mee as Ariel .
And I will campe against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with a mount , and I will raise forts against thee .
And thou shalt bee brought downe , and shalt speake out of the ground , and thy speach shall be low out of the dust , and thy voyce shalbe as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speach shall whisper out of the dust .
Moreouer the multitude of thy strangers shalbe like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shalbe as chaffe , that passeth away ; yea it shalbe at an instant suddenly .
Thou shalt bee visited of the Lord of hostes with thunder , and with earthquake , and great noise , with storme and tempest , and the flame of deuouring fire .
¶ And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , euen all that fight against her and her munition , and that distresse her , shalbe as a dreame of a night vision .
It shall euen be as when a hungry man dreameth , and behold he eateth ; but he awaketh , and his soule is emptie : or as when a thirstie man dreameth , and behold he drinketh ; but hee awaketh , and behold he is faint , and his soule hath appetite : so shall the multitude of all the nations bee , that fight against mount Zion .
¶ Stay your selues and wonder , cry yee out , and cry : they are drunken , but not with wine , they stagger , but not with strong drinke .
For the Lord hath powred out vpon you the spirit of deepe sleepe , and hath closed your eyes : the Prophets and your rulers , the Seers hath hee couered .
And the vsion of all is become vnto you , as the wordes of a booke that is sealed , which men deliuer to one that is learned , saying , Reade this , I pray thee : and hee saith , I cannot , for it is sealed .
And the booke is deliuered to him that is not learned , saying , Reade this , I pray thee : and he saith , I am not learned .
¶ Wherefore the Lord said , Forasmuch as this people draw neere mee with their mouth , and with their lips doe honour me , but haue remoued their heart farre from me , and their feare towards mee is taught by the precept of men :
Therefore behold , I will proceed to do a marueilous worke amongst this people , euen a marueilous worke and a wonder : for the wisedome of their wise men shall perish , and the vnderstanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
Woe vnto them that seeke deepe to hide their counsell from the Lord , and their workes are in the darke , and they say , Who seeth vs ? and who knoweth vs ?
Surely your turning of things vpside downe shall be esteemed as the potters clay : for shall the worke say of him that made it , He made me not ? or shall the thing framed , say of him that framed it , He had no vnderstanding ?
Is it not yet a very litle while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitfull field shall be esteemed as a forrest ?
¶ And in that day shall the deafe heare the words of the booke , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscuritie , and out of darkenesse .
The meeke also shall increase their ioy in the Lord , and the poore among men shall reioice in the holy One of Israel .
For the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquitie are cut off :
That make a man an offendour for a word , and lay a snare for him that reproueth in the gate , and turne aside the iust for a thing of nought .
Therefore thus saith the Lord who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Iacob : Iacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now waxe pale .
But when hee seeth his children the worke of mine hands in the midst of him , they shall sanctifie my Name , and sanctifie the Holy One of Iacob , and shall feare the God of Israel .
<NON-VERSE>
Woe to the rebellious children , sayth the Lord , that take counsell , but not of mee ; and that couer with a couering , but not of my Spirit , that they may adde sinne to sinne :
That walke to goe downe into Egypt , ( and haue not asked at my mouth ) to strengthen themselues in the strength of Pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt .
Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame , and the trust in the shadow of Egypt , your confusion .
For his princes were at Zoan , and his ambassadors came to Hanes .
They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them , nor be an helpe nor profite , but a shame and also a reproch .
The burden of the beastes of the South : into the lande of trouble and anguish , from whence come the yong and old lyon , the viper , and fierie flying serpent , they will carie their riches vpon the shoulders of yong asses , and their treasures vpon the bunches of camels , to a people that shall not profite them .
For the Egyptians shall helpe in vaine , and to no purpose : Therefore haue I cried concerning this : Their strength is to sit still .
¶ Now goe , write it before them in a table , and note it in a booke , that it may bee for the time to come for euer and euer :
That this is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not heare the Law of the Lord :
Which say to the seers , See not ; and to the prophets , Prophecie not vnto vs right things : speake vnto vs smooth things , prophecie deceits .
Get ye out of the way : turne aside out of the path : cause the Holy one of Israel to cease from before vs .
Wherefore , thus saith the Holy one of Israel : Because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and peruersnesse , and stay thereon :
Therefore this iniquitie shalbe to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking commeth suddenly at an instant .
And he shall breake it as the breaking of the potters vessell , that is broken in pieces , he shall not spare ; so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it , a sheard to take fire from the hearth , or to take water withall out of the pit .
For thus saith the Lord God , the Holy one of Israel , In returning and rest shall ye be saued , in quietnesse and in confidence shalbe your strength , and ye would not :
But ye said ; No , for we will flee vpon horses ; therefore shall ye flee . And we will ride vpon the swift ; therefore shall they that pursue you , be swift .
One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one : at the rebuke of fiue , shall ye flee , till ye be left as a beacon vpon the top of a mountaine , and as an ensigne on a hill .
¶ And therefore wil the Lord wait that he may be gracious vnto you , and therefore wil he be exalted that he may haue mercy vpon you : for the Lord is a God of Iudgment . Blessed are all they that wait for him .
For the people shall dwel in Zion at Ierusalem : thou shalt weepe no more : hee will be very gracious vnto thee , at the voice of thy cry ; when he shall heare it , he will answere thee .
And though the Lord giue you the bread of aduersitie , and the water of affliction , yet shall not thy teachers be remooued into a corner any more : but thine eyes shall see thy teachers .
And thine eares shall heare a word behinde thee , saying ; This is the way , walke ye in it , when ye turne to the right hand , and when ye turne to the left .
Ye shall defile also the couering of thy grauen images of siluer , and the ornament of thy moulten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth , thou shalt say vnto it ; Get thee hence .
Then shall he giue the raine of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withall ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shalbe fat and plenteous : in that day shall thy cattell feed in large pastures .
The oxen likewise and the yong asses that eare the ground , shall eate cleane prouender which hath bene winnowed with the shouell and with the fanne .
And there shall be vpon euery high mountaine , and vpon euery high hill , riuers and streames of waters , in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall .
Moreouer the light of the Moone shalbe as the light of the Sunne , and the light of the Sunne shall be seuenfold , as the light of seuen dayes , in the day that the Lord bindeth vp the breach of his people , and healeth the stroke of their wound .
¶ Beholde , the Name of the Lord commeth from farre , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heauy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a deuouring fire .
And his breath as an ouerflowing streame , shall reach to the midst of the necke , to sift the nations with the sieue of vanitie : and there shalbe a bridle in the iawes of the people causing them to erre .
Yee shall haue a song as in the night , when a holy solemnitie is kept , and gladnesse of heart , as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountaine of the Lord , to the mighty one of Israel .
And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard , and shall shew the lighting downe of his arme , with the indignation of his anger , and with the flame of a deuouring fire , with scattering and tempest and hailestones .
For through the voyce of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten downe , which smote with a rod .
And in euery place where the grounded staffe shall passe , which the Lord shall lay vpon him , it shall be with tabrets and harpes : and in battels of shaking will he fight with it .
<NON-VERSE>
Woe to them that go down to Egypt for helpe , and stay on horses , and trust in charets , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are very strong : but they looke not vnto the Holy one of Israel , neither seeke the Lord .
Yet he also is wise , and will bring euill , and wil not call backe his words : but will arise against the house of the euill doers , and against the helpe of them that worke iniquitie .
Now the Egyptians are men and not God , and their horses flesh and not spirit : when the Lord shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and hee that is holpen shall fall downe , and they all shall faile together .
For thus hath the Lord spoken vnto me ; Like as the lyon and the yong lyon roaring on his pray , when a multitude of shepheards is called foorth against him , he will not be afraid of their voice , nor abase himselfe for the noyse of them : so shall the Lord of hostes come downe to fight for mount Zion , and for the hill thereof .
As birds flying , so wil the Lord of hostes defend Ierusalem , defending also hee will deliuer it , and passing ouer , he will preserue it .
¶ Turne yee vnto him from whom the children of Israel haue deeply reuolted .
For in that day euery man shall cast away his idoles of siluer , and his idoles of gold , which your owne hands haue made vnto you for a sinne .
¶ Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword , not of a mightie man ; and the sword , not of a meane man , shal deuoure him : but hee shall flee from the sword , and his young men shall be discomfited .
<NON-VERSE>
Behold , a King shal reigne in righteousnes , and princes shal rule in iudgement .
And a man shall be as an hiding place from the winde , and a couert from the tempest : as riuers of water in a drie place , as the shadow of a great rocke in a wearie land .
And the eyes of them that see , shall not be dimme ; and the eares of them that heare , shall hearken .
The heart also of the rash shall vnderstand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall bee readie to speake plainely .
The vile person shall be no more called liberall , nor the churle sayd to be bountifull .
For the vile person wil speake villenie , and his heart will worke iniquitie , to practise hypocrisie , and to vtter errour against the Lord , to make emptie the soule of the hungry , and hee will cause the drinke of the thirstie to faile .
The instruments also of the churle are euill : he deuiseth wicked deuices , to destroy the poore with lying wordes , euen when the needie speaketh right .
But the liberall deuiseth liberall things , and by liberall things shall hee stand .
¶ Rise vp ye women that are at ease : heare my voice , ye carelesse daughters , giue eare vnto my speech .
Many dayes and yeeres shall ye be troubled , yee carelesse women : for the vintage shall faile , the gathering shall not come .
Tremble yee women that are at ease : be troubled , ye carelesse ones , strip ye and make ye bare , and gird sackecloth vpon your loynes .
They shall lament for the teats , for the pleasant fieldes , for the fruitfull vine .
Upon the land of my people shall come vp thornes , and briars , yea vpon all the houses of ioy in the ioyous citie .
Because the palaces shall be forsaken , the multitude of the citie shall be left , the forts and towres shall be for dennes for euer , a ioy of wild asses , a pasture of flockes ;
Untill the spirit be powred vpon vs from on high , and the wildernesse be a fruitfull field , and the fruitfull field be counted for a forrest .
Then iudgement shall dwell in the wildernesse , and righteousnesse remaine in the fruitfull field .
And the worke of righteousnesse shalbe peace , and the effect of righteousnesse , quietnesse and assurance for euer .
And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwellings , and in quiet resting places :
When it shall haile , comming downe on the forrest ; and the citie shall be low in a low place .

Woe to thee that spoilest , and thou wast not spoiled ; and dealest treacherously , and they dealt not treacherously with thee : when thou shalt cease to spoile , thou shalt bee spoiled ; and when thou shalt make an end to deale treacherously , they shall deale treacherously with thee .
O Lord , be gratious vnto vs , we haue waited for thee : be thou their arme euery morning , our saluation also in the time of trouble .
At the noise of the tumult the people fled : at the lifting vp of thy selfe the nations were scattered .
And your spoile shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller : as the running to and fro of Locusts shall he runne vpon them .
The Lord is exalted : for hee dwelleth on high , he hath filled Zion with iudgement and righteousnesse .
And wisedome and knowledge shall be the stabilitie of thy times , and strength of saluation : the feare of the Lord is his treasure .
Behold , their valiant ones shall cry without : the ambassadours of peace shall weepe bitterly .
The high wayes lye waste ; the way faring man ceaseth : he hath broken the couenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth no man .
The earth mourneth and languisheth : Lebanon is ashamed and hewen downe : Sharon is like a wildernes , and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits .
Now will I rise , saith the Lord : now will I be exalted , now will I lift vp my selfe .
Yee shall conceiue chaffe , yee shall bring forth stubble : your breath as fire shall deuoure you .
And the people shalbe as the burnings of lyme : as thornes cut vp shall they be burnt in the fire .
¶ Heare yee that are farre off , what I haue done ; and yee that are neere , acknowledge my might .
The sinners in Zion are afraid , fearefulnesse hath surprised the hypocrites : who among vs shall dwell with the deuouring fire ? who amongst vs shall dwell with euerlasting burnings ?
He that walketh righteously , and speaketh vprightly , hee that despiseth the gaine of oppressions , that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes , that stoppeth his eares from hearing of blood , and shutteth his eyes from seeing euill :
He shall dwell on high : his place of defence shalbe the munitions of rocks , bread shalbe giuen him , his waters shall be sure .
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall behold the land that is very farre off .
Thine heart shall meditate terrour ; Where is the scribe ? where is the receiuer ? where is he that counted the towres ?
Thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech then thou canst perceiue ; of a stammering tongue , that thou canst not vnderstand .
Looke vpon Zion , the city of our solemnities : thine eyes shall see Ierusalem a quiet habitation , a tabernacle that shall not be taken downe , not one of the stakes thereof shall euer be remoued , neither shall any of the coardes thereof be broken .
But there the glorious Lord will be vnto vs a place of broad riuers and streames ; wherein shall goe no galley with oares , neither shall gallant ship passe thereby .
For the Lord is our Iudge , the Lord is our Lawgiuer , the Lord is our King , he wil saue vs .
Thy tacklings are loosed : they could not well strengthen their mast , they could not spread the saile : then is the praye of a great spoile diuided , the lame take the praye .

Come neere ye nations to heare , and hearken ye people : let the earth heare , and all that is therein , the world , and all things that come forth of it .
For the indignation of the Lord is vpon all nations , and his furie vpon all their armies : hee hath vtterly destroyed them , he hath deliuered them to the slaughter .
Their slaine also shalbe cast out , and their stinke shall come vp out of their carkeises , and the mountaines shalbe melted with their blood .
And all the hoste of heauen shalbe dissolued , and the heauens shalbe rouled together as a scrole : and all their hoste shall fall downe as the leafe falleth off from the Uine , and as a falling figge from the figge tree .
For my sword shall bee bathed in heauen : beholde , it shall come downe vpon Idumea , and vpon the people of my curse to iudgement .
The sword of the Lord is filled with blood , it is made fat with fatnesse , and with the blood of lambes and goates , with the fat of the kidneys of rammes : for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah , and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea .
And the Unicornes shall come downe with them , and the bullockes with the bulles , and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatnesse .
For it is the day of the Lords vengeance , and the yeere of recompences for the controuersie of Zion .
And the streames thereof shalbe turned into pitch , and the dust thereof into brimstone , and the land thereof shall become burning pitch .
It shal not be quenched night nor day , the smoke thereof shall goe vp for euer : from generation to generation it shall lye waste , none shal passe through it for euer and euer .
¶ The cormorant and the bitterne shall possesse it , the owle also and the rauen shall dwell in it , and he shall stretch out vpon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptinesse .
They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdome , but none shall bee there , and all her Princes shall bee nothing . And thornes shall come vp in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shalbe an habitation of dragons , and a court for owles .
The wilde beasts of the desert shall also meete with the wilde beasts of the Iland and the satyre shall cry to his felow , the shrichowle also shall rest there , & finde for her selfe a place of rest .
There shall the great owle make her nest , and lay and hatch , and gather vnder her shadow : there shall the vultures also be gathered , euery one with her mate .
¶ Seeke ye out of the booke of the Lord , and reade : no one of these shall faile , none shall want her mate : for my mouth , it hath commaunded , and his spirit , it hath gathered them .
<NON-VERSE>
The wildernesse and the solitarie place shall be glad for them : and the desert shall reioyce and blossome as the rose .
It shall blossome abundantly , and reioyce euen with ioy and singing : the glory of Lebanon shal be giuen vnto it , the excellencie of Carmel and Sharon : they shall see the glory of the Lord , and the excellencie of our God .
¶ Strengthen yee the weake hands , and confirme the feeble knees .
Say to them that are of a fearefull heart ; Be strong , feare not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , euen God with a recompence , he will come and saue you .
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the eares of the deafe shalbe vnstopped .
Then shall the lame man leape as an Hart , and the tongue of the dumbe sing : for in the wildernesse shall waters breake out , and streames in the desert .
And the parched ground shall become a poole , and the thirstie land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shalbe grasse with reeds and rushes .
And an high way shalbe there , and away , and it shall be called the way of holinesse , the vncleane shall not passe ouer it , but it shall be for those : the wayfaringmen , though fooles , shall not erre therein .
No lyon shalbe there ; nor any rauenous beast shall goe vp thereon , it shall not be found there : but the redeemed shall walke there .

Nowe it came to passe in the fourteenth yeere of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came vp against all the defenced cities of Iudah , and tooke them .
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh , from Lachish to Ierusalem , vnto king Hezekiah , with a great armie : and he stood by the conduit of the vpper poole in the high way of the fullers field .
Then came forth vnto him Eliakim Hilkiahs sonne , which was ouer the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Ioah Asaphs sonne the Recorder .
¶ And Rabshakeh sayd vnto them ; Say yee now to Hezekiah ; Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria ; What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
I say , ( sayest thou ) ( but they are but vaine words ) I haue counsell and strength for warre : Now on whom doest thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
Loe , thou trustest in the staffe of this broken reede , on Egypt ; whereon if a man leane , it will goe into his hand and pierce it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him .
But if thou say to me ; We trust in the Lord our God : Is it not he , whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and sayd to Iudah and to Ierusalem ; Yee shall worship before this altar ?
Now therefore giue pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will giue thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders vpon them .
How then wilt thou turne away the face of one captaine of the least of my masters seruants : and put thy trust on Egypt for charets and for horsemen ?
And am I now come vp without the Lord against this land to destroy it ? the Lord sayd vnto me ; Goe vp against this land and destroy it .
¶ Then sayd Eliakim and Shebna & Ioah vnto Rabshakeh ; Speake , I pray thee , vnto thy seruants in the Syrian language ; for we vnderstand it : and speake not to vs in the Iewes language , in the eares of the people that are on the wall .
¶ But Rabshakeh sayd ; Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee , to speake these words ? Hath he not sent me to the men that sit vpon the wall , that they may eate their owne dongue , and drinke their owne pisse with you ?
Then Rabshakeh stood , and cryed with a loud voice in the Iewes language , and sayd ; Heare ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
Thus saith the king ; Let not Hezekiah deceiue you , for he shall not be able to deliuer you .
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying ; The Lord will surely deliuer vs : this citie shall not be deliuered into the hand of the King of Assyria .
Hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus sayth the King of Assyria , Make an agreement with mee by a present , and come out to mee : and eate yee euery one of his vine , and euery one of his figgetree , and drinke yee euery one the waters of his owne cisterne :
Until I come and take you away to a land like your owne land , a land of corne and wine , a land of bread and vineyards :
Beware lest Hezekiah perswade you , saying ; The Lord will deliuer vs . Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
Where are the gods of Hamath , and Arphad ? where are the gods of Sepharuaim ? and haue they deliuered Samaria out of my hand ?
Who are they amongst all the gods of these landes , that haue deliuered their land out of my hand , that the Lord should deliuer Ierusalem out of my hand ?
But they held their peace , and answered him not a word : for the Kings commandement was , saying ; Answere him not .

And it came to passe when King Hezekiah heard it , that hee rent his clothes , and couered himselfe with sackecloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
And hee sent Eliakim , who was ouer the houshold , and Shebna the Scribe , and the Elders of the Priestes couered with sackecloth , vnto Isaiah the Prophet the sonne of Amoz .
And they sayd vnto him ; Thus sayth Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemie : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring foorth .
It may be the Lord thy God will heare the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproch the liuing God , and will reprooue the words which the Lord thy God hath heard : wherefore lift vp thy prayer for the remnant that is left .
So the seruants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
¶ And Isaiah sayd vnto them ; Thus shall yee say vnto your master , Thus sayth the Lord , Be not afraid of the wordes that thou hast heard , wherewith the seruants of the king of Assyria haue blasphemed me .
Behold , I will send a blast vpon him , and hee shall heare a rumour , and returne to his owne land , and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his owne land .
¶ So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for hee had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , Hee is come foorth to make warre with thee : and when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ;
Thus shall ye speake to Hezekiah King of Iudah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceiue thee , saying , Ierusalem shall not bee giuen into the hand of the king of Assyria .
Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria haue done to all lands by destroying them vtterly , and shalt thou be deliuered ?
Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed , as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ?
Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arphad , and the king of the citie of Sepharuaim , Hena and Iuah ?
¶ And Hezekiah receiued the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it , and Hezekiah went vp vnto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
And Hezekiah prayed vnto the Lord , saying ,
O Lord of hostes , God of Israel , that dwellest betweene the Cherubims , thou art the God , euen thou alone , of all the kingdomes of the earth , thou hast made heauen and earth .
Encline thine eare , O Lord , and heare , Open thine eyes , O Lord , and see , and heare all the wordes of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproch the liuing God .
Of a trueth , Lord , the kings of Assyria haue laid waste all the nations and their countreys ,
And haue cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of mens hands , wood and stone : therfore they haue destroyed them .
Now therefore , O Lord our God , saue vs from his hand , that all the kingdomes of the earth may knowe , that thou art the Lord , euen thou onely .
¶ Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent vnto Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Wheras thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria :
This is the worde which the Lord hath spoken concerning him : The virgin , the daughter of Zion hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorne , the daughter of Ierusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
Whom hast thou reproched and blasphemed ? and against whome hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted vp thine eyes on high ? euen against the Holy One of Israel .
By thy seruants hast thou reproched the Lord , and hast said , By the multitude of my charets am I come vp to the height of the mountaines , to the sides of Lebanon , and I wil cut downe the tall cedars thereof , and the choise firre trees thereof : and I will enter into the height of his border , and the forrest of his Carmel .
I haue digged and drunke water , and with the sole of my feete haue I dried vp all the riuers of the besieged places .
Hast thou not heard long agoe , how I haue done it , and of ancient times , that I haue formed it ? now haue I brought it to passe , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heapes .
Therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded : they were as the grasse of the field , and as the greene herbe , as the grasse on the house tops , and as corne blasted before it be growen vp .
But I know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy comming in , and thy rage against me .
Because thy rage against me , and thy tumult is come vp into mine eares : therefore will I put my hooke in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and I will turne thee backe by the way by which thou camest .
And this shall be a signe vnto thee , Ye shall eate this yeere such as groweth of it felfe : and the second yeere that which springeth of the same : and in the third yeere sow ye and reape , and plant vineyards , and eate the fruit thereof .
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah , shal againe take roote downeward , and beare fruite vpward .
For out of Ierusalem shall goe forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this .
Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this citie , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shields , nor cast a banke against it .
By the way that he came , by the same shall he returne , and shall not come into this citie , saith the Lord .
For I will defend this citie to saue it , for mine owne sake , and for my seruant Dauids sake .
Then the Angel of the Lord went forth , and smote in the campe of the Assyrians a hundred and fourescore and fiue thousand : and when they arose earely in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
¶ So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went , and returned , and dwelt at Nineueh .

In those daies was Hezekiah sicke vnto death : and Isaiah the Prophet the sonne of Amoz came vnto him , and said vnto him ; Thus saith the Lord , Set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not liue .
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall , and prayed vnto the Lord ,
And said , Remember now , O Lord , I beseech thee , how I haue walked before thee in trueth , and with a perfect heart , and haue done that which is good in thy sight : and Hezekiah wept sore .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah , saying ,
Goe and say to Hezekiah , Thus saith the Lord , the God of Dauid thy father ; I haue heard thy prayer , I haue seene thy teares : behold , I will adde vnto thy dayes fifteene yeeres .
And I will deliuer thee and this citie , out of the hand of the king of Assyria : and I will defend this citie .
And this shall be a signe vnto thee from the Lord , that the Lord will doe this thing that he hath spoken .
Behold , I will bring againe the shadow of the degrees which is gone downe in the Sunne - diall of Ahaz ten degrees backward : so the Sunne returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone downe .
¶ The writing of Hezekiah king of Iudah , when he had bene sicke , and was recouered of his sicknesse :
I saide in the cutting off of my dayes ; I shall goe to the gates of the graue : I am depriued of the residue of my yeeres .
I said , I shal not see the Lord , euen the Lord in the land of the liuing : I shal behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
Mine age is departed , and is remoued from me as a shepheards tent : I haue cut off like a weauer my life : he will cut mee off with pining sicknesse : from day euen to night wilt thou make an end of me .
I reckoned till morning , that as a Lyon so will hee breake all my bones : from day euen to night wilt thou make an end of me .
Like a crane or a swallow , so did I chatter ; I did mourne as a doue : mine eyes faile with looking vpward : O Lord , I am oppressed , vndertake for me .
What shall I say ? hee hath both spoken vnto mee , and himselfe hath done it : I shall goe softly , all my yeeres in the bitternesse of my soule .
O Lord , by these things men liue : and in all these things is the life of my spirit , so wilt thou recouer me , and make me to liue .
Behold , for peace I had great bitternesse , but thou hast in loue to my soule deliuered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sinnes behinde thy backe .
For the graue cannot praise thee , death cannot celebrate thee : they that goe downe into the pit cannot hope for thy trueth .
The liuing , the liuing , hee shall praise thee , as I doe this day : the father to the children shall make knowen thy trueth .
The Lord was ready to saue me : therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments , all the dayes of our life , in the house of the Lord .
For Isaiah had said , Let them take a lumpe of figges , and lay it for a plaister vpon the boile , and he shall recouer .

At that time Merodach Baladan the sonne of Baladan king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah : for hee had heard that he had bene sicke , and was recouered .
And Hezekiah was glad of them , and shewed them the house of his precious things , the siluer , and the golde , and the spices , and the precious oyntment , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found in his treasures : there was nothing in his house , nor in all his dominion , that Hezekiah shewed them not .
¶ Then came Isaiah the Prophet vnto King Hezekiah , and sayde vnto him , What sayd these men ? and from whence came they vnto thee ? And Hezekiah said , They are come from a farre countrey vnto me , euen from Babylon .
Then said hee , What haue they seene in thine house ? And Hezekiah answered , All that is in mine house haue they seene : there is nothing among my treasures , that I haue not shewed them .
Then sayde Isaiah to Hezekiah , Heare the word of the Lord of hostes .
Behold , the dayes come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers haue laide vp in store , vntill this day , shalbe caried to Babylon : nothing shalbe left , saith the Lord .
And of thy sonnes that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall bee Eunuches in the palace of the king of Babylon .

¶ The voyce of him that cryeth in the wildernesse , Prepare yee the way of the Lord , make straight in the desert a high way for our God .
Euery valley shalbe exalted , and euery mountaine and hill shalbe made low : and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plaine .
And the glory of the Lord shall be reuealed , and all flesh shall see it together : for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it .
The voyce sayd ; Cry . And hee sayd ; What shall I cry ? All flesh is grasse , and all the goodlinesse thereof is as the flowre of the field .
The grasse withereth , the flowre fadeth ; because the spirit of the Lord bloweth vpon it : surely the people is grasse .
The grasse withereth , the flowre fadeth : but the word of our God shall stand for euer .
¶ O Zion , that bringest good tydings , get thee vp into the high mountaine : O Ierusalem , that bringest good tidings , lift vp thy voyce with strength , lift it vp , be not afraid : say vnto the cities of Iudah ; Behold your God .
Behold , the Lord God will come with strong hand , and his arme shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his worke before him .
He shall feede his flocke like a shepheard : he shall gather the lambes with his arme ; and carie them in his bosome , and shall gently lead those that are with yoong .
¶ Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand ? and meted out heauen with the spanne , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountaines in scales , and the hilles in a balance ?
Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord , or , being his counseller , hath taught him ?
With whom tooke he counsell , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of iudgement ? and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of vnderstanding ?
Behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance : behold , hee taketh vp the yles as a very litle thing .
And Lebanon is not sufficient to burne , nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offring .
All nations before him are as nothing , and they are counted to him lesse then nothing , and vanitie .

Yea they shal not be planted , yea they shall not be sowen , yea their stocke shall not take roote in the earth : and he shall also blow vpon them , & they shall wither , and the whirlewinde shall take them away as stubble .
To whom then will ye liken me , or shal I be equall , saith the Holy One ?
Lift vp your eyes on high , and behold who hath created these things , that bringeth out their host by number : he calleth them all by names , by the greatnesse of his might , for that hee is strong in power , not one faileth .
Why sayest thou , O Iacob , and speakest O Israel , My way is hid from the Lord , and my iudgement is passed ouer from my God ?
¶ Hast thou not knowen ? hast thou not heard , that the euerlasting God , the Lord , the Creatour of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is wearie ? there is no searching of his vnderstanding .
He giueth power to the faint , and to them that haue no might , he increaseth strength .
Euen the youths shall faint , and be weary , and the yong men shall vtterly fall .

¶ Feare thou not , for I am with thee : be not dismaied , for I am thy God : I will strengthen thee , yea I will helpe thee , yea I will vphold thee with the right hand of my righteousnesse . Behold , all they that were incensed against thee , shalbe ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing , and they that striue with thee , shall perish .
Thou shalt seeke them , and shalt not find them , euen them that contended with thee : they that warre against thee shalbe as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand , saying vnto thee , Feare not , I will helpe thee .
Feare not , thou worme Iacob , and ye men of Israel : I will helpe thee , saith the Lord , and thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel .
Behold , I will make thee a new sharpe threshing instrument hauing teeth : thou shalt thresh the mountaines , and beate them small , and shalt make the hilles as chaffe .

When the poore and needie seeke water and there is none , and their tongue faileth for thirst , I the Lord will heare them , I the God of Israel will not forsake them .

I will plant in the wildernes the Cedar , the Shittah tree , and the Myrtle , and the Oyle tree : I will set in the desert the Firre tree , and the Pine and the Boxe tree together :
That they may see , and knowe , and consider , and vnderstand together , that the hand of the Lord hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it .
Produce your cause , saith the Lord , bring foorth your strong reasons , saith the King of Iacob .

A bruised reed shall he not breake , and the smoking flaxe shall hee not quench : he shall bring forth iudgment vnto trueth .
He shall not faile nor be discouraged , till he haue set iudgement in the earth : and the yles shall waite for his lawe .

To open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in darkenesse out of the prison house .
I am the Lord ; that is my name , and my glory will I not giue to another , neither my praise to grauen images .
Behold , the former things are come to passe , and new things doe I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
Sing vnto the Lord a newe song , and his praise from the end of the earth : yee that goe downe to the sea , and all that is therein ; the yles , and the inhabitants thereof .
Let the wildernes and the cities thereof lift vp their voyce , the villages that Kedar doeth inhabite : let the inhabitants of the rocke sing , let them shoute from the top of the mountaines .

The Lord shall goe foorth as a mighty man , he shall stirre vp iealousie like a man of warre : he shall cry , yea roare ; hee shall preuaile against his enemies .

Seeing many things , but thou obseruest not : opening the eares , but he heareth not .

Feare not , for I am with thee : I will bring thy seed from the East , and gather thee from the West .

He burneth part thereof in the fire : with part thereof he eateth flesh : he rosteth rost , and is satisfied : yea hee warmeth himselfe , and saith ; Aha , I am warme , I haue seene the fire .
And the residue thereof he maketh a God , euen his grauen image : hee falleth downe vnto it , and worshippeth it , and prayeth vnto it , and saith ; Deliuer me , for thou art my God .
They haue not knowen , nor vnderstood : for he hath shut their eyes , that they cannot see ; and their hearts , that they cannot vnderstand .
And none considereth in his heart , neither is there knowledge nor vnderstanding to say ; I haue burnt part of it in the fire , yea also I haue baked bread vpon the coales thereof : I haue rosted flesh and eaten it ; and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination ? shall I fall downe to the stocke of a tree ?

Bel boweth downe , Nebo stoupeth , their idoles were vpon the beasts , and vpon the cattell : your carriages were heauie loaden , they are a burden to the wearie beast .
They stoupe , they bow downe together , they could not deliuer the burden , but themselues are gone into captiuitie .
¶ Hearken vnto me , O house of Iacob , and al the remnant of the house of Israel , which are borne by me , from the belly , which are caried from the wombe .
And euen to your old age I am he , and euen to hoare haires will I cary you : I haue made , and I will beare , euen I wil cary and wil deliuer you .
¶ To whom wil ye liken me , and make me equall , and compare me , that we may be like ?
They lauish gold out of the bagge , and weigh siluer in the balance , and hire a goldsmith , and hee maketh it a god : they fall downe , yea they worship .
They beare him vpon the shoulder , they cary him and set him in his place , and hee standeth ; from his place shall he not remooue : yea one shall cry vnto him , yet can he not answere , nor saue him out of his trouble .
Remember this , and shew your selues men : bring it againe to minde , O ye transgressours .
Remember the former things of old , for I am God , and there is none else , I am God , and there is none like me ,
Declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , My counsell shall stand , and I wil doe all my pleasure :
Calling a rauenous bird from the East , the man that executeth my counsell from a farre countrey ; yea I haue spoken it , I will also bring it to passe , I haue purposed it , I will also doe it .
¶ Hearken vnto me , ye stout hearted , that are farre from righteousnesse .

Come downe and sit in the dust : O virgin daughter of Babylon , sit on the ground : there is no throne , O daughter of the Caldeans : for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate .
Take the milstones and grinde meale , vncouer thy lockes : make bare the legge : vncouer the thigh , passe ouer the riuers .
Thy nakednes shalbe vncouered , yea thy shame shalbe seene : I will take vengeance , and I will not meet thee as a man .
As for our redeemer , the Lord of hostes is his Name , the Holy one of Israel .
Sit thou silent , and get thee into darknes , O daughter of the Caldeans : for thou shalt no more be called the Ladie of kingdomes .
¶ I was wroth with my people : I haue polluted mine inheritance , and giuen them into thine hand : thou didst shew them no mercy ; vpon the ancient hast thou very heauily layed the yoke .
¶ And thou saydst , I shall bee a Ladie for euer : so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart , neither didst remember the later end of it .
Therefore heare now this , thou that art giuen to pleasures , that dwellest carelesly , that sayest in thine heart , I am , and none else besides mee , I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the losse of children .
But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day ; the losse of children , and widowhood ; they shall come vpon thee in their perfection , for the multitude of thy sorceries , and for the great abundance of thine inchantments .
¶ For thou hast trusted in thy wickednesse : thou hast said , None seeth me . Thy wisedome and thy knowledge , it hath peruerted thee , and thou hast said in thine heart , I am , and none else besides me .
¶ Therefore shall euill come vpon thee , thou shalt not know from whence it riseth : and mischiefe shall fall vpon thee , thou shalt not be able to put it off : and desolation shall come vpon thee suddenly , which thou shalt not know .
Stand now with thine inchantments , and with the multitude of thy sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profite , if so be thou mayest preuaile .
Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels : let now the astrologers , the starre - gazers , the monethly prognosticators stand vp , and saue thee from these things that shall come vpon thee .
Behold , they shall be as stubble : the fire shall burne them , they shall not deliuer themselues from the power of the flame : there shall not bee a coale to warme at , nor fire to sit before it .

Heare yee this , O house of Iacob , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come foorth out of the waters of Iudah ; which sweare by the Name of the Lord , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in trueth nor in righteousnes .
For they call themselues of the holy city , and stay themselues vpon the God of Israel , the Lord of hostes is his Name .
I haue declared the former things from the beginning : and they went foorth out of my mouth , and I shewed them , I did them suddenly , and they came to passe .
Because I knew that thou art obstinate , and thy necke is an yron sinew , and thy brow brasse :
I haue euen from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to passe I shewed it thee : lest thou shouldest say , Mine idole hath done them , and my grauen image , and my molten image hath commanded them .
Thou hast heard , see all this , and will not yee declare it ? I haue shewed thee new things from this time , euen hidden things , and thou didst not know them .
They are created now , and not from the beginning , euen before the day when thou heardest them not ; lest thou shouldest say , Behold , I knew them .
Yea thou heardest not , yea thou knewest not , yea from that time that thine eare was not opened : for I knew that thou wouldest deale very treacherously , and wast called a transgressour from the wombe .
¶ For my names sake will I deferre mine anger , and for my praise will I refraine for thee , that I cut thee not off .
Behold , I haue refined thee , but not with siluer ; I haue chosen thee in the fornace of affliction .
For mine owne sake , euen for mine owne sake will I doe it ; for how should my Name bee polluted ? And I will not giue my glory vnto another .
¶ Hearken vnto me , O Iacob , and Israel my called ; I am hee , I am the first , I also am the last .
Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spanned the heauens : when I call vnto them , they stand vp together .
All yee assemble your selues and heare : which among them hath declared these things ? the Lord hath loued him : hee will doe his pleasure on Babylon , and his arme shall be on the Caldeans .
I , euen I haue spoken , yea I haue called him : I haue brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
¶ Come ye neere vnto me ; heare ye this ; I haue not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I ; and now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me .
Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer , the holy one of Israel ; I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit , which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest goe .
O that thou haddest hearkened to my commandements ! then had thy peace beene as a riuer , and thy righteousnesse as the waues of the sea .
Thy seede also had beene as the sand , and the ofspring of thy bowels like the grauell thereof : his name should not haue beene cut off , nor destroyed from before me .
¶ Goe yee forth of Babylon : flee yee from the Caldeans , with a voyce of singing , declare yee , tell this , vtter it euen to the end of the earth : say yee ; The Lord hath redeemed his seruant Iacob .

Listen , O yles , vnto me , and hearken yee people from farre . The Lord hath called mee from the wombe , from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
And he hath made my mouth like a sharpe sword , in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made mee a polished shaft ; in his quiuer hath hee hid me ,
And sayd vnto me ; Thou art my seruant , O Israel , in whom I will be glorified .
Then I said ; I haue laboured in vaine , I haue spent my strength for nought , and in vaine , yet surely my iudgement is with the Lord , and my worke with my God .
¶ And now , saith the Lord that formed me from the wombe to be his seruant , to bring Iacob againe to him ; Though Israel be not gathered , yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord , and my God shall bee my strength .
And he said , It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my seruant to raise vp the tribes of Iacob , and to restore the preserued of Israel : I will also giue thee for a light to the Gentiles , that thou mayest be my saluation , vnto the end of the earth .
Thus saith the Lord the redeemer of Israel , and his holy one , to him whom man dispiseth , to him whom the nation abhorreth , to a seruant of rulers ; Kings shall see and arise , princes also shall worship , because of the Lord , that is faithfull , and the holy one of Israel , and he shall choose thee .
Thus saith the Lord , In an acceptable time haue I heard thee , and in a day of saluation haue I helped thee : and I will preserue thee , and giue thee for a couenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherite the desolate heritages :
That thou mayest say to the prisoners , Goe forth ; to them that are in darkenesse , Shewe your selues : they shall feede in the wayes , and their pastures shalbe in all high places .
They shall not hunger nor thirst , neither shall the heate nor sunne smite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , euen by the springs of water shall he guide them .
And I will make all my mountaines a way , and my high wayes shall be exalted .
Behold , these shall come from far : and loe , these from the North and from the West , and these from the land of Sinim .

But Zion said , The Lord hath forsaken me , and my Lord hath forgotten me .
Can a woman forget her sucking child , that she should not haue compassion on the sonne of her wombe ? yea they may forget , yet will I not forget thee .
Behold , I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my hands : thy walles are continually before mee .
Thy children shal make haste , thy destroyers , and they that made thee waste , shall goe forth of thee .
¶ Lift vp thine eyes round about , and behold : all these gather themselues together and come to thee : as I liue , saith the Lord , thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all , as with an ornament , and bind them on thee as a bride doeth .
For thy waste and thy desolate places , and the land of thy destruction shall euen now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants , and they that swallowed thee vp , shall bee farre away .
The children which thou shalt haue , after thou hast lost the other , shall say againe in thine eares , The place is too straight for me : giue place to mee that I may dwell .
Then shalt thou say in thine heart , Who hath begotten me these , seeing I haue lost my children and am desolate , a captiue and remouing to and fro ? and who hath brought vp these ? Beholde , I was left alone , these where had they beene ?
Thus saith the Lord God , Behold , I will lift vp mine hand to the Gentiles , and set vp my standerd to the people : and they shall bring thy sonnes in their armes : and thy daughters shal be caried vpon their shoulders .

¶ Shall the pray be taken from the mightie , or the lawfull captiue deliuered ?

Wherefore when I came was there no man ? when I called , was there none to answere ? Is my hand shortened at all , that it cannot redeeme ? or haue I no power to deliuer ? Beholde , at my rebuke I drie vp the sea : I make the riuers a wildernes : their fish stinketh , because there is no water , and dieth for thirst .
I clothe the heauens with blackenesse , and I make sackcloth their couering .
The Lord God hath giuen me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speake a worde in season to him that is wearie : hee wakeneth morning by morning , hee wakeneth mine eare to heare as the learned .
¶ The Lord God hath opened mine eare , and I was not rebellious , neither turned away backe .
I gaue my backe to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the haire : I hidde not my face from shame and spitting .
¶ For the Lord God will helpe me , therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore haue I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not bee ashamed .
He is neere that iustifieth me , who will contend with me ? let vs stand together : who is mine aduersarie ? let him come neere to me .
Behold , the Lord God wil helpe me , who is he that shall condemne mee ? Loe , they all shall waxe olde as a garment : the moth shall eate them vp .

For the Lord shall comfort Zion : he wil comfort all her waste places , and he wil make her wildernes like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the Lord : ioy and gladnesse shalbe found therein , thankesgiuing , and the voice of melody . ¶ Hearken vnto me , my people , and giue eare vnto me , O my nation : for a Law shall proceed from mee , and I will make my iudgement to rest for a light of the people .
My righteousnes is neere : my saluation is gone foorth , and mine armes shall iudge the people : the Iles shall wait vpon me , and on mine arme shall they trust .
Lift vp your eyes to the heauens , and looke vpon the earth beneath : for the heauens shall vanish away like smoke , and the earth shall waxe old like a garment , and they that dwel therein shall die in like maner : but my saluation shal be for euer , and my righteousnes shall not be abolished .

Art thou not it which hath dried the sea , the waters of the great deepe , that hath made the depthes of the sea a way for the ransomed to passe ouer ?
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall returne , and come with singing vnto Zion , and euerlasting ioy shalbe vpon their head : they shall obtaine gladnesse and ioy , and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
I , euen I am hee that comforteth you , who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the sonne of man which shall bee made as grasse ?
And forgettest the Lord thy maker that hath stretched foorth the heauens , and layed the foundations of the earth ? and hast feared continually euery day , because of the furie of the oppressour , as if hee were ready to destroy ? and where is the furie of the oppressour ?
The captiue exile hasteneth that he may be loosed , and that hee should not die in the pit , nor that his bread should faile .
But I am the Lord thy God , that diuided the sea , whose waues roared : the Lord of hosts is his Name .
And I haue put my wordes in thy mouth , and haue couered thee in the shadow of mine hand , that I may plant the heauens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and say vnto Zion , Thou art my people .
¶ Awake , awake , stand vp , O Ierusalem , which hast drunke at the hand of the Lord the cup of his furie ; thou hast drunken the dregges of the cup of trembling , and wrung them out .
There is none to guide her among all the sonnes whom shee hath brought foorth : neither is there any that taketh her by the hand , of all the sonnes that she hath brought vp .
These two things are come vnto thee ; who shall be sorie for thee ? desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
Thy sonnes haue fainted , they lie at the head of all the streetes as a wilde bull in a net ; they are full of the furie of the Lord , the rebuke of thy God .
¶ Therefore heare now this thou afflicted and drunken , but not with wine .
Thus saith thy Lord , the Lord and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people , Behold , I haue taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling , euen the dregges of the cup of my furie : thou shalt no more drinke it againe .

For thus sayth the Lord , Yee haue solde your selues for nought : and ye shall be redeemed without money .
For thus saith the Lord God , My people went downe aforetime into Egypt to soiourne there , and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause .
Now therefore , what haue I here , sayth the Lord , that my people is taken away for nought ? they that rule ouer them , make them to howle , sayth the Lord , and my Name continually euery day is blasphemed .
Therefore my people shall know my Name : therefore they shall know in that day , that I am he that doth speake . Behold , it is I .
¶ How beautifull vpon the mountaines are the feete of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace , that bringeth good tidings of good , that publisheth saluation , that sayth vnto Zion , Thy God reigneth ?

He is despised and reiected of men , a man ofsorrows , and acquainted with griefe : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; hee was despised , and wee esteemed him not .
¶ Surely he hath borne our griefes , and caried our sorrowes : yet we did esteeme him striken , smitten of God , and afflicted .
But he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was vpon him , and with his stripes we are healed .
All we like sheepe haue gone astray : we haue turned euery one to his owne way , and the Lord hath layd on him the iniquitie of vs all .
He was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lambe to the slaughter , and as a sheepe before her shearers is dumme , so he openeth not his mouth .
He was taken from prison , and from iudgement : and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the liuing , for the transgression of my people was he stricken .
And he made his graue with the wicked , and with the rich in his death , because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
¶ Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him , he hath put him to griefe : when thou shalt make his soule an offring for sinne , he shall see his seede , hee shall prolong his daies , and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand .
He shall see of the trauell of his soule , and shalbe satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righteous seruant iustifie many : for hee shall beare their iniquities .

Sing O barren thou that didst not beare ; breake forth into singing , and crie aloud thou that didst not trauell with child : for more are the children of the desolate then the children of the maried wife , saith the Lord .
Enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtaines of thine habitations : spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes .
For thou shalt breake forth on the right hand , and on the left ; and thy seed shall inherite the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
Feare not : for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded , for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
For thy maker is thine husband , ( the Lord of hostes is his name ; ) and thy redeemer the holy one of Israel , the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken , and grieued in spirit , and a wife of youth , when thou wast refused , saith thy God .
For a small moment haue I forsaken thee , but with great mercies will I gather thee .
In a litle wrath I hid my face from thee , for a moment ; but with euerlasting kindnesse will I haue mercie on thee , saith the Lord thy redeemer .
For this is as the waters of Noah vnto me : for as I haue sworne that the waters of Noah should no more goe ouer the earth ; so haue I sworne that I would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
For the mountaines shall depart , and the hilles be remoued , but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee , neither shall the couenant of my peace be remoued , saith the Lord , that hath mercie on thee .

Let the wicked forsake his way , & the vnrighteous man his thoughts : and let him returne vnto the Lord , and he will haue mercie vpon him , and to our God , for hee will abundantly pardon .
¶ For my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your wayes my wayes , saith the Lord .

For thus saith the Lord vnto the Eunuches that keep my Sabbaths , and choose the things that please mee , and take hold of my couenant :
Euen vnto them will I giue in mine house , and within my walles , a place and a name better then of sonnes and of daughters : I wil giue them an euerlasting name , that shal not be cut off .

Inflaming your selues with idoles vnder euery greene tree , slaying the children in the valleys vnder the cliftes of the rockes ?
Among the smooth stones of the streame is thy portion ; they , they are thy lot : euen to them hast thou powred a drinke offering , thou hast offered a meate offering . Should I receiue comfort in these ?
Upon a loftie and high mountaine hast thou set thy bed : euen thither wentest thou vp to offer sacrifice .
Behinde the doores also and the posts hast thou set vp thy remembrance : for thou hast discouered thy selfe to an other then mee , and art gone vp : thou hast enlarged thy bed , and made a couenant with them : thou louedst their bed where thou sawest it .
And thou wentest to the king with oyntment , and didst increase thy perfumes , and didst send thy messengers farre off , and didst debase thy selfe euen vnto hell .
Thou art wearied in the greatnesse of thy way ; yet saydst thou not , There is no hope : thou hast found the life of thine hand ; therefore thou wast not grieued .
And of whom hast thou bene afraid or feared , that thou hast lyed , and hast not remembred me , nor layed it to thy heart ? haue not I held my peace euen of old , and thou fearest me not ?

For I will not contend for euer , neither will I be alwayes wroth : for the spirit should faile before me , and the soules which I haue made .
For the iniquitie of his couetousnesse was I wroth , and smote him : I hid me , and was wroth , and hee went on frowardly in the way of his heart . I haue seene his wayes , and will heale him : I will leade him also , and restore comforts vnto him , and to his mourners .
I create the fruite of the lippes ; peace , peace to him that is farre off , and to him that is neere , sayth the Lord , and I will heale him .

¶ Wherefore haue wee fasted , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore haue wee afflicted our soule , & thou takest no knowledge ? Behold , in the day of your fast you find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
Behold , yee fast for strife and debate ; and to smite with the fist of wickednesse , yee shall not fast as yee doe this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
Is it such a fast that I haue chosen ? a day for a man to afflict his soule ? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush , and to spread sackecloth and ashes vnder him ? wilt thou call this a fast , and an acceptable day to the Lord ?
Is not this the fast that I haue chosen ? to loose the bandes of wickednesse , to vndoe the heauie burdens , and to let the oppressed goe free , and that ye breake euery yoke ?
Is it not , to deale thy bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poore that are cast out , to thy house ? when thou seest the naked , that thou couer him , and that thou hide not thy selfe from thine owne flesh ?
¶ Then shall thy light breake foorth as the morning , and thine health shall spring foorth speedily : and thy righteousnesse shall goe before thee , the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward .
Then shalt thou call , and the Lord shall answere ; thou shalt cry , and he shal say , Here I am : if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking vanitie :
And if thou draw out thy soule to the hungry , and satisfie the afflicted soule : then shall thy light rise in obscuritie , and thy darkenesse be as the noone day .
And the Lord shal guide thee continually , and satisfie thy soule in drought , and make fat thy bones : and thou shalt be like a watered garden , and like a spring of water , whose waters faile not .
And they that shall be of thee , shall builde the olde waste places : thou shalt raise vp the foundations of many generations ; and thou shalt be called , the repairer of the breach , the restorer of paths to dwell in .
¶ If thou turne away thy foote from the Sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my Holy day , and call the Sabbath a delight , the holy of the Lord , honourable , and shalt honour him , not doing thine owne wayes , nor finding thine owne pleasure , nor speaking thine owne wordes :
<NON-VERSE>
Beholde , the Lords hand is not shortened , that it cannot saue : neither his eare heauie , that it cannot heare .
But your iniquities haue separated betweene you and your God , and your sinnes haue hid his face from you , that he will not heare .
For your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquitie , your lippes haue spoken lies , your tongue hath muttered peruersnesse .
None calleth for iustice , nor any pleadeth for trueth : they trust in vanity and speake lies ; they conceiue mischiefe , and bring forth iniquitie .
They hatch cockatrice egges , and weaue the spiders web : he that eateth of their egges dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
Their webbes shall not become garments , neither shall they couer themselues with their workes : their workes are workes of iniquitie , and the act of violence is in their hands .
Their feete runne to euill , and they make haste to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity , wasting & destruction are in their paths .
The way of peace they know not , and there is no iudgement in their goings : they haue made them crooked pathes ; whosoeuer goeth therein , shall not know peace .
¶ Therefore is iudgement farre from vs , neither doth iustice ouertake vs : we waite for light , but behold obscuritie , for brightnesse , but we walke in darknesse .
We grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eies : we stumble at noone day as in the night , we are in desolate places as dead men .
We roare all like beares , and mourne sore like doues : we looke for iudgement , but there is none ; for saluation , but it is farre off from vs .
For our transgressions are multiplied before thee , and our sinnes testifie against vs : for our transgressions are with vs , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
In transgressing and lying against the Lord , and departing away from our God , speaking oppression and reuolt , conceiuing and vttering from the heart words of falshood .
And iudgement is turned away backward , and iustice standeth a farre off : for truth is fallen in the streete , and equitie cannot enter .
Yea truth faileth , and he that departeth from euill maketh himselfe a pray : and the Lord saw it , and it displeased him , that there was no iudgement .
¶ And hee saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessour . Therefore his arme brought saluation vnto him , and his righteousnesse , it sustained him .
For he put on righteousnesse as a brestplate , and an helmet of saluation vpon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeale as a cloake .
According to their deedes accordingly he will repay , furie to his aduersaries , recompence to his enemies , to the ylands he will repay recompence .
So shall they feare the name of the Lord from the West , and his glory from the rising of the sunne : when the enemie shall come in like a flood , the spirit of the Lord shall lift vp a standard against him .
¶ And the redeemer shall come to Zion , and vnto them that turne from transgression in Iacob , saith the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Arise , shine , for thy light is come , and the glory of the Lord is risen vpon thee .
For behold , the darknesse shall couer the earth , and grosse darknesse the people : but the Lord shall arise vpon thee , and his glory shall be seene vpon thee .
And the Gentiles shall come to thy light , and kings to the brightnesse of thy rising .
Lift vp thine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselues together , they come to thee : thy sonnes shall come from farre , and thy daughters shalbe nourced at thy side .
Then thou shalt see , and flow together , and thine heart shall feare and be inlarged , because the abundance of the Sea shalbe conuerted vnto thee , the forces of the Gentiles shall come vnto thee .
The multitude of camels shall couer thee , the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah : all they from Sheba shall come : they shal bring gold and incense , and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord .
All the flockes of Kedar shall be gathered together vnto thee , the rams of Nebaioth shall minister vnto thee : they shall come vp with acceptance on mine altar , and I wil glorifie the house of my glory .
Who are these that flie as a cloude , and as the doues to their windowes ?
Surely the yles shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring thy sonnes from farre , their siluer and their gold with them , vnto the Name of the Lord thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because he hath glorified thee .
And the sonnes of strangers shall build vp thy walles , and their kings shal minister vnto thee : for in my wrath I smote thee , but in my fauour haue I had mercie on thee .
Therefore thy gates shal be open continually , they shall not bee shut day nor night , that men may bring vnto thee the forces of the Gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
For the nation and kingdome that will not serue thee , shall perish , yea those nations shall be vtterly wasted .
The glory of Lebanon shal come vnto thee , the Firre tree , the Pine tree , and the Boxe together , to beautifie the place of my Sanctuarie , and I will make the place of my feete glorious .
The sonnes also of them that afflicted thee , shall come bending vnto thee : and all they that despised thee shal bow themselues downe at the soles of thy feet , and they shall call thee the citie of the Lord , the Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
Whereas thou hast bene forsaken and hated , so that no man went thorow thee , I will make thee an eternall excellencie , a ioy of many generations .
Thou shalt also sucke the milke of the Gentiles , and shalt sucke the brest of kings , and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Sauiour and thy Redeemer , the mightie One of Iacob .
For brasse I will bring gold , and for yron I will bring siluer , and for wood brasse , and for stones yron : I will also make thy officers peace , and thine exactours righteousnesse .
Uiolence shall no more be heard in thy land , wasting nor destruction within thy borders , but thou shalt call thy walles saluation , and thy gates praise .
The Sunne shall be no more thy light by day , neither for brightnesse shall the moone giue light vnto thee : but the Lord shall be vnto thee an euerlasting light , & thy God thy glory .
Thy Sunne shall no more goe downe , neither shall thy moone withdraw it selfe : for the Lord shall bee thine euerlasting light , and the dayes of thy mourning shall be ended .
Thy people also shall be all righteous : they shal inherit the land for euer , the branch of my planting , the worke of my hands , that I may be glorified .
<NON-VERSE>
The Spirit of the Lord God is vpon me , because the Lord hath anointed me , to preach good tidings vnto the meeke , hee hath sent me to binde vp the broken hearted , to proclaime libertie to the captiues , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound :
To proclaime the acceptable yere of the Lord , and the day of vengeance of our God , to comfort all that mourne :
To appoint vnto them that mourne in Zion , to giue vnto them beautie for ashes , the oyle of ioy for mourning , the garment of praise for the spirit of heauinesse , that they might be called trees of righteousnesse , the planting of the Lord , that he might be glorified .
¶ And they shall build the olde wastes , they shall raise vp the former desolations , and they shall repaire the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
And strangers shall stand and feed your flockes , and the sonnes of the alient shalbe your plowmen , and your Uine - dressers .
But ye shalbe named the Priests of the Lord : men shall call you the ministers of our God : ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory shall you boast your selues .
¶ For your shame you shall haue double ; and for confusion they shall reioyce in their portion : therefore in their land they shal possesse the double : euerlasting ioy shalbe vnto them .
For I the Lord loue Iudgement , I hate robbery for burnt offering , and I will direct their worke in trueth , and I will make an euerlasting Couenant with them .
And their seed shalbe knowen among the Gentiles , and their offspring among the people : All that see them , shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed .
I will greatly reioyce in the Lord , my soule shalbe ioyfull in my God : for he hath clothed me with the garments of saluation , he hath couered me with the robe of righteousnes , as a bridegrome decketh himselfe with ornaments , and as a bride adorneth herselfe with her iewels .
<NON-VERSE>
For Zions sake , wil I not hold my peace , and for Ierusalems sake I will not rest , vntill the righteousnesse thereof goe forth as brightnesse , and the saluation thereof as a lampe that burneth ;
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousnes , and all Kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the Lord shall name .
Thou shalt also be a crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord , and a royall diademe in the hand of thy God .
Thou shalt no more bee termed , Forsaken ; neither shall thy land any more be termed , Desolate : but thou shalt be called Hephzi - bah , and thy land , Beulah : for the Lord delighteth in thee , and thy land shalbe maried .
¶ For as a yong man marrieth a virgine , so shall thy sonnes marry thee : and as the bridegrome reioyceth ouer the bride , so shall thy God reioyce ouer thee .
I haue set watchmen vpon thy walles , O Ierusalem , which shall neuer hold their peace day nor night : ye that make mention of the Lord , keepe not silence :
And giue him no rest till he establish , and till hee make Ierusalem a praise in the earth .
The Lord hath sworne by his Right hand , and by the arme of his strength , Surely , I will no more giue thy corne to be meat for thine enemies , and the sonnes of the stranger shall not drinke thy wine , for the which thou hast laboured :
But they that haue gathered it shall eat it , and praise the Lord , and they that haue brought it together , shal drinke it in the Courts of my Holinesse .
¶ Goe through , goe through the gates : prepare you the way of the people : cast vp , cast vp the high way , gather out the stones , lift vp a standard for the people .
Behold , the Lord hath proclaimed vnto the end of the world , say ye to the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy saluation commeth ; behold , his reward is with him , and his worke before him .
<NON-VERSE>
Who is this that commeth from Edom , with died garments from Bozrah ? this that is glorious in his apparel , trauelling in the greatnesse of his strength ? I that speake in righteousnesse , mightie to saue .
Wherefore art thou red in thine apparell , and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat ?
I haue troden the winepresse alone , and of the people there was none with me : for I will tread them in mine anger , and trample them in my furie , and their blood shall be sprinkled vpon my garments , and I will staine all my raiment .
For the day of vengeance is in mine heart , and the yeere of my redeemed is come .
And I looked , and there was none to helpe ; and I wondered that there was none to vphold : therefore mine owne arme brought saluation vnto me , and my furie , it vpheld me .
And I will tread downe the people in mine anger , & make them drunke in my furie , and I will bring downe their strength to the earth .
¶ I will mention the louing kindnesses of the Lord , and the praises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on vs ; and the great goodnes towards the house of Israel , which he hath bestowed on them , according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his louing kindnesses .
For hee said , Surely they are my people , children that will not lie : so hee was their sauiour .
In all their affliction he was afflicted , and the Angel of his presence saued them : in his loue and in his pitie hee redeemed them , and he bare them , and caried them all the dayes of olde .
¶ But they rebelled , and vexed his holy spirit : therefore hee was turned to be their enemie , and he fought against them .
Then he remembred the dayes of old , Moses and his people , saying ; Where is hee that brought them vp out of the Sea , with the shepheard of his flocke ? where is hee that put his holy Spirit within him ?
That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arme , diuiding the water before them , to make himselfe an euerlasting name ?
That led them through the deepe as an horse in the wildernesse , that they should not stumble ?
As a beast goeth downe into the valley , the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest : so diddest thou leade thy people , to make thy selfe a glorious Name .
¶ Looke downe from heauen , and behold from the habitation of thy holinesse , and of thy glory : where is thy zeale and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels , and of thy mercies towards me ? are they restrained ?
Doubtlesse thou art our father , though Abraham be ignorant of vs , and Israel acknowledge vs not : thou , O Lord art our Father , our Redeemer , thy Name is from euerlasting .
¶ O Lord , why hast thou made vs to erre from thy wayes ? and hardened our heart from thy feare ? Returne for thy seruants sake , the tribes of thine inheritance .
The people of thy holinesse haue possessed it but a little while : our aduersaries haue troden downe thy Sanctuarie . <NON-VERSE>
Oh that thou wouldest rent the heauens , that thou wouldest come down , that the mountaines might flowe downe at thy presence ,
As when the melting fire burneth , the fire causeth the waters to boyle : to make thy Name knowen to thine aduersaries , that the nations may tremble at thy presence .
When thou diddest terrible things which wee looked not for , thou camest downe , the mountaines flowed downe at thy presence .
For since the beginning of the world men haue not heard , nor perceiued by the eare , neither hath the eye seene , O God , besides thee , what hee hath prepared for him that waiteth for him .
Thou meetest him that reioyceth , and worketh righteousnesse , those that remember thee in thy wayes : behold , thou art wroth , for we haue sinned : in those is continuance , and we shall be saued .
But we are al as an vncleane thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy ragges , and we all doe fade as a leafe , and our iniquities like the wind haue taken vs away .
And there is none that calleth vpon thy name , that stirreth vp himselfe to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid thy face from vs , and hast consumed vs because of our iniquities .
But now , O Lord , thou art our father : we are the clay , and thou our potter , and we all are the worke of thine hand .
¶ Be not wroth very sore , O Lord , neither remember iniquitie for euer : behold , see we beseech thee , we are all thy people .
Thy holy cities are a wildernesse , Zion is a wildernesse , Ierusalem a desolation .
Our holy and our beautifull house , where our fathers praised thee , is burnt vp with fire , and all our pleasant things are layed waste :
<NON-VERSE>
I am sought of them that asked not for me : I am found of them that sought me not : I said , Behold me , behold me , vnto a nation that was not called by my name .
I haue spread out my hands all the day vnto a rebellious people , which walketh in a way that was not good , after their owne thoughts :
A people that prouoketh mee to anger continually to my face , that sacrificeth in gardens , and burneth incense vpon altars of bricke :
Which remaine among the graues , and lodge in the monuments , which eate swines flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels :
Which say ; Stand by thy selfe , come not neere to me ; for I am holier then thou : these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
Behold , it is written before me : I will not keepe silence , but will recompence , euen recompence into their bosome ,
Your iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , ( saith the Lord ) which haue burnt incense vpon the mountaines , & blasphemed mee vpon the hils : therfore will I measure their former worke into their bosome .
¶ Thus saith the Lord , As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one saith , Destroy it not , for a blessing is in it : so wil I doe for my seruants sakes , that I may not destroy them all .
And I will bring forth a seede out of Iacob , and out of Iudah an inheritour of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my seruants shall dwell there .
And Sharon shall be a fold of flockes , and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie downe in , for my people that haue sought me .
¶ But yee are they that for sake the Lord , that forget my holy mountaine , that prepare a table for that troope , and that furnish the drinke offring vnto that number .
Therefore will I number you to the sword , and yee shall all bow downe to the slaughter : because when I called , yee did not answere ; when I spake , yee did not heare , but did euill before mine eyes , and did choose that wherein I delighted not :
Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , my seruants shall eate , but ye shall be hungry : behold , my seruants shall drinke , but yee shall be thirstie : behold , my seruants shall reioyce , but yee shall be ashamed .
Behold , my seruants shall sing for ioy of heart , but yee shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall howle for vexation of spirit .
And yee shall leaue your name for a curse vnto my chosen : for the Lord God shall slay thee , and call his seruants by another name :
That he who blesseth himselfe in the earth , shall blesse himselfe in the God of trueth ; and he that sweareth in the earth , shall sweare by the God of trueth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
And I wil reioyce in Ierusalem , and ioy in my people , and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
There shalbe no more thence an infant of dayes , nor an olde man , that hath not filled his dayes : for the childe shall die an hundreth yeeres olde : but the sinner being an hundreth yeres old , shalbe accursed .
And they shall builde houses , and inhabite them , and they shall plant vineyards , and eate the fruit of them .
They shal not build , and another inhabit : they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the daies of a tree , are the dayes of my people , and mine elect shal long enioy the worke of their hands .
They shall not labour in vaine , nor bring forth for trouble : for they are the seede of the blessed of the Lord , and their offspring with them .
And it shal come to passe , that before they call , I will answere , & whiles they are yet speaking , I will heare .
<NON-VERSE>
Thus sayth the Lord , The heauen is my throne , and the earth is my footestoole : where is the house that yee builde vnto mee ? and where is the place of my rest ?
For all those things hath mine hand made , and all those things haue beene , saith the Lord : but to this man wil I looke , euen to him that is poore and of a contrite spirit , and trembleth at my word .
He that killeth an oxe is as if he slue a man : he that sacrificeth a lambe , as if he cut off a dogs necke : he that offereth an oblation , as if he offered swines blood : he that burneth incense , as if he blessed an idole : yea , they haue chosen their owne wayes , and their soule delighteth in their abominations .
I also will chuse their delusions , and will bring their feares vpon them ; because when I called , none did answere , when I spake they did not heare : but they did euill before mine eyes , and chose that in which I delighted not .
¶ Heare the word of the Lord , ye that tremble at his word : Your brethren that hated you , that cast you out for my Names sake , sayd , Let the Lord be glorified : but he shal appeare to your ioy , and they shalbe ashamed .
A voice of noyse from the city , a voice from the Temple , a voice of the Lord , that rendreth recompense to his enemies .
Before she trauailed , she brought foorth : before her paine came , shee was deliuered of a man childe .
Who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seene such things ? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day , or shall a nation be borne at once ? for as soone as Zion traueiled , shee brought foorth her children .
Shall I bring to the birth , & not cause to bring forth , saith the Lord ? shall I cause to bring foorth , and shut the wombe , sayth thy God ?
Reioyce ye with Ierusalem , and be glad with her , all yee that loue her : reioyce for ioy with her , all yee that mourne for her :
That ye may sucke and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations : that ye may milke out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
For thus sayth the Lord , Behold , I will extend peace to her like a riuer , and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing streame : then shall ye sucke , ye shalbe borne vpon her sides , and be dandled vpon her knees .
As one whom his mother comforteth , so wil I comfort you : and ye shall be comforted in Ierusalem .
And when yee see this , your heart shall reioyce , and your bones shall flourish like an herbe : and the hand of the Lord shall be knowen towards his seruants , and his indignation towards his enemies .
For behold , the Lord wil come with fire , and with his charets like a whirlewinde , to render his anger with furie , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
For by fire and by his sword , will the Lord plead with all flesh : and the slaine of the Lord shalbe many .
They that sanctifie themselues , and purifie themselues in the gardens , behinde one tree in the midst , eating swines flesh , and the abomination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , saith the Lord .
For I know their works and their thoughts : it shall come that I will gather all nations and tongues , and they shall come and see my glorie .
And I will set a signe among them , and I will send those that escape of them vnto the nations , to Tarshish , Pul and Lud , that draw the bow , to Tubal and Iauan , to the Iles afarre off , that haue not heard my fame , neither haue seene my glory , and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles .
And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering vnto the Lord , out of all nations , vpon horses and in charets , and in litters , and vpon mules , and vpon swift beasts to my holie mountaine Ierusalem , saith the Lord ; as the children of Israel bring an offering in a cleane vessell , into the house of the Lord .
And I will also take of them for Priestes and for Leuites , saith the Lord .
For as the new heauens , and the new earth which I wil make , shall remaine before me , saith the Lord , so shall your seed and your name remaine .
And it shall come to passe , that from one new Moone to an other , and from one Sabbath to an other , shall all flesh come to worship before me , saith the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Iames a seruant of God , and of the Lord Iesus Christ , to the twelue Tribes which are scattered abroad , greeting .
My brethren , count it all ioy when ye fall into diuers temptations ,
Knowing this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience ,
But let patience haue her perfect worke , that ye may be perfect , and entier , wanting nothing .
If any of you lacke wisedome , let him aske of God , that giueth to all men liberally , and vpbraideth not : and it shalbe giuen him .
But let him aske in faith , nothing wauering : for he that wauereth is like a waue of the sea , driuen with the wind , and tossed . For let not that man thinke that he shall receiue any thing of the Lord .
A double minded man is vnstable in all his wayes .
For the Sunne is no sooner risen with a burning heate , but it withereth the grasse ; and the flowre thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his wayes .
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when hee is tried , hee shall receiue the crowne of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him .
Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God cannot be tempted with euill , neither tempteth he any man .
But euery man is tempted , when hee is drawen away of his owne lust , and entised .
Then when lust hath conceiued , it bringeth forth sinne : and sinne , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
Doe not erre , my beloued brethren .
Euery good gift , and euery perfect gift is from aboue , & commeth downe from the Father of lights , with whom is no variablenesse , neither shadow of turning .
Of his owne will begate hee vs , with the word of Trueth , that wee should bee a kinde of first fruites of his creatures .
Wherefore my beloued brethren , let euery man bee swift to heare , slow to speake , slow to wrath .
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousnesse of God .
Wherefore lay apart all filthinesse , and superfluitie of naughtinesse , & receiue with meeknesse the engrafted word , which is able to saue your soules .
But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers onely , receiuing your owne selues .
For if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like vnto a man beholding his naturall face in a glasse :
For hee beholdeth himselfe , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what maner of man he was .
But who so looketh into the perfect Law of libertie , and continueth therein , he being not a forgetfull hearer , but a doer of the worke , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
If any man among you seeme to be religious , & bridleth not his tongue , but deceiueth his owne heart , this mans religion is vaine .
<NON-VERSE>
My brethren , haue not the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ the Lord of glorie , with respect of persons .
For if there come vnto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poore man , in vile raiment :
And yee haue respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say vnto him , Sit thou here in a good place : and say to the poore , Stand thou there , or sit here vnder my footstoole :
Are yee not then partiall in your selues , and are become iudges of euill thoughts ?
Hearken , my beloued brethren , Hath not God chosen the poore of this world , rich in faith , and heires of the kingdome , which hee hath promised to them that loue him ?
But yee haue despised the poore . Doe not rich men oppresse you , and draw you before the Iudgement seats ?
Doe not they blaspheme that worthy Name , by the which ye are called ?
If ye fulfil the royall Law , according to the Scripture , Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe , ye doe well .
But if ye haue respect to persons , ye commit sinne , and are conuinced of the Law , as transgressours .
For whosoeuer shall keepe the whole Law , & yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
For he that said , Doe not commit adultery ; sayd also , Do not kill . Now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressour of the Law .
So speake ye , and so doe , as they that shall bee iudged by the Law of libertie .
For he shall haue iudgement without mercie , that hath shewed no mercy , & mercie reioyceth against iudgement .
What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say hee hath faith , and haue not workes ? can faith saue him ?
If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of dayly foode ,
And one of you say vnto them , Depart in peace , be you warmed & filled : notwithstanding ye giue them not those things which are needfull to the body : what doth it profit ?
Euen so faith , if it hath not works , is dead being alone .
Yea , a man may say , Thou hast faith , and I haue workes : shew mee thy faith without thy workes , and I will shew thee my faith by my workes .
Thou beleeuest that there is one God , thou doest well : the deuils also beleeue , and tremble .
But wilt thou knowe , O vaine man , that faith without workes is dead ?
Was not Abraham our father iustified by works , when hee had offered Isaac his sonne vpon the altar ?
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
And the Scripture was fullfiled which saith , Abraham beleeued God , and it was imputed vnto him for righteousnes : and he was called the friend of God .
Ye see then , how that by workes a man is iustified , and not by faith only .
Likewise also , was not Rahab the harlot iustified by works , when she had receiued the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
<NON-VERSE>
My brethren , bee not many masters , knowing that we shall receiue the greater condemnation .
For in many things we offend all . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
Behold , we put bittes in the horses mouthes , that they may obey vs , and we turne about their whole body .
Behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driuen of fierce windes , yet are they turned about with a very small helme , whithersoeuer the gouernour listeth .
Euen so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth great things : behold , how great a matter a litle fire kindleth .
And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquitie : so is the tongue amongst our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature , and it is set on fire of hell .
For euery kind of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind .
But the tongue can no man tame , it is an vnruly euill , ful of deadly poyson .
Therewith blesse wee God , euen the Father : and therewith curse wee men , which are made after the similitude of God .

But if ye haue bitter enuying and strife in your hearts glory not , and lie not against the trueth .
This wisedome descendeth not from aboue , but is earthly , sensuall , deuilish .
For where enuying and strife is , there is confusion , and euery euill worke .
But the wisedome that is from aboue , is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easie to be intreated , full of mercy , and good fruits , without partialitie , and without hypocrisie .

From whence come warres and fightings among you ? come they not hence , euen of your lusts , that warre in your members ?

Then said I , Ah Lord God , behold , I cannot speake , for I am a childe .
¶ But the Lord sayd vnto me , Say not , I am a childe : for thou shalt goe to all that I shall send thee , and whatsoeuer I command thee , thou shalt speake .

And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee the second time , saying ; What seest thou ? And I said ; I see a seething pot , and the face thereof was towards the North .
Then the Lord said vnto me ; Out of the North an euill shal breake foorth vpon all the inhabitants of the land .
For loe , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the North , saith the Lord , and they shall come , and they shall set euery one his throne at the entring of the gates of Ierusalem , and against all the walles thereof round about , & against all the cities of Iudah .

¶ For of old time I haue broken thy yoke , and burst thy bands , and thou saidst ; I will not transgresse : when vpon euery high hill , and vnder euery greene tree thou wandrest , playing the harlot .

For though thou wash thee with nitre , and take thee much sope , yet thine iniquitie is marked before me , saith the Lord GOD .

Lift vp thine eyes vnto the high places , and see where thou hast not bene lien with : in the wayes hast thou sate for them , as the Arabian in the wildernesse , and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredomes , and with thy wickednes .
Therefore the showres haue bin withholden , and there hath bene no latter raine , and thou haddest a whores forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .

And I said after she had done all these things ; Turne thou vnto me : but shee returned not , and her treacherous sister Iudah saw it .
And I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adulterie , I had put her away and giuen her a bill of diuorce : yet her treacherous sister Iudah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
And it came to passe thorow the lightnes of her whoredome , that shee defiled the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stockes .

And it shall come to passe when yee bee multiplied and increased in the land ; in those dayes , saith the Lord , they shal say no more ; The Arke of the Couenant of the Lord : neither shal it come to minde , neither shall they remember it , neither shall they visit it , neither shall that be done any more .
At that time they shall call Ierusalem the Throne of the Lord , and all the nations shalbe gathered vnto it , to the Name of the Lord , to Ierusalem : neither shall they walke any more after the imagination of their euill heart .
In those dayes the house of Iudah shall walke with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the North to the land that I haue giuen for an inheritance vnto your fathers .
But I said ; How shall I put thee among the children , and giue thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the hostes of nations ? and I said , Thou shalt call me ; My father , and shalt not turne away from me .
¶ Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband : so haue you dealt treacherously with mee , O house of Israel , saith the Lord .

Circumcise your selues to the Lord , and take away the foreskinnes of your heart , ye men of Iudah , and inhabitants of Ierusalem , lest my furie come forth like fire , and burne that none can quench it , because of the euill of your doings .

And it shall come to passe at that day , saith the Lord , that the heart of the King shall perish , and the heart of the Princes : and the Priests shalbe astonished , & the prophets shall wonder .
Then said I , Ah Lord God , surely thou hast greatly deceiued this people , and Ierusalem , saying , Ye shall haue peace , whereas the sword reacheth vnto the soule .
At that time shall it bee said to this people , and to Ierusalem ; A dry winde of the high places in the wildernes toward the daughter of my people , not to fanne , nor to cleanse .
Euen a full winde from those places shall come vnto mee : now also will I giue sentence against them .
Behold , hee shall come vp as cloudes , and his charets shall bee as a whirlewinde : his horses are swifter then Eagles : woe vnto vs , for wee are spoiled .

As keepers of a fielde are they against her round about ; because shee hath bene rebellious against mee , saith the Lord .
Thy way and thy doings haue procured these things vnto thee , this is thy wickednes because it is bitter , because it reacheth vnto thine heart .
¶ My bowels , my bowels , I am pained at my very heart , my heart maketh a noise in mee , I cannot hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soule , the sound of the Trumpet , the alarme of warre .
Destruction vpon destruction is cried , for the whole land is spoiled : suddenly are my tents spoiled , and my curtaines in a moment .
How long shal I see the standard and heare the sound of the Trumpet ?
For my people is foolish , they haue not knowen me , they are sottish children , and they haue none vnderstanding : they are wise to doe euill , but to doe good they haue no knowledge .

I beheld , and loe , the fruitfull place was a wildernesse , and all the cities thereof were broken downe at the presence of the Lord , and by his fierce anger .

For this shall the earth mourne , and the heauens aboue be blacke : because I haue spoken it , I haue purposed it , and will not repent , neither will I turne backe from it .
The whole citie shall flee , for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen , they shall goe into thickets , and climbe vp vpon the rockes : euery city shall be forsaken , and not a man dwell therein .
And when thou art spoiled , what wilt thou doe ? though thou clothest thy selfe with crimsin , though thou deckest thee with ornaments of golde , though thou rentest thy face with painting , in vaine shalt thou make thy selfe faire , thy louers will despise thee , they will seeke thy life .

Runne yee to and fro thorow the streetes of Ierusalem , and see now and knowe , and seeke in the broad places thereof , if ye can finde a man , if there be any that executeth iudgement , that seeketh the trueth , and I will pardon it .
And though they say , The Lord liueth , surely they sweare falsely .
O Lord , are not thine eyes vpon the trueth ? thou hast stricken them , but they haue not grieued ; thou hast consumed them , but they haue refused to receiue correction : they haue made their faces harder then a rocke , they haue refused to returne .
Therefore I said , Surely these are poore , they are foolish : for they know not the way of the Lord , nor the iudgement of their God .
I wil get me vnto the great men , and will speake vnto them , for they haue knowen the way of the Lord , and the iudgement of their God : but these haue altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bondes .
Wherfore a lyon out of the forrest shall slay them , and a wolfe of the euenings shall spoile them , a leopard shall watch ouer their cities : euery one that goeth out thence shalbe torne in pieces , because their transgressions are many , and their backeslidings are increased .
¶ How shall I pardon thee for this ? thy children haue forsaken mee , and sworne by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adulterie , and assembled themselues by troupes in the harlots houses .
They were as fed horses in the morning : euery one neighed after his neighbours wife :
Shall I not visit for these things , sayth the Lord , and shall not my soule bee auenged on such a nation as this ?
¶ Goe yee vp vpon her walles , and destroy , but make not a full ende : take away her battlements , for they are not the Lords .

Wherfore thus saith the Lord God of Hostes ; Because yee speake this word , behold , I will make my words in thy mouth , fire , and this people wood , and it shall deuoure them .
Loe , I will bring a nation vpon you from farre , O house of Israel , saith the Lord : it is a mighty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither vnderstandest what they say .
Their quiuer is as an open sepulchre , they are all mighty men .
And they shall eate vp thine haruest and thy bread , which thy sonnes and thy daughters should eate : they shall eate vp thy flockes and thine heards : they shall eate vp thy vines and thy figtrees : they shall impouerish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
Neuerthelesse in those daies , saith the Lord , I will not make a full end with you .
¶ And it shall come to passe when yee shall say ; Wherefore doth the Lord our God all these things vnto vs ? then shalt thou answere them ; Like as ye haue forsaken me , & serued strange Gods in your land ; so shall yee serue strangers in a land that is not yours .
Declare this in the house of Iacob , and publish it in Iudah saying ;
Heare now this , O foolish people , and without vnderstanding , which haue eyes and see not , which haue eares and heare not .
Feare yee not mee , saith the Lord ? Will yee not tremble at my presence , which haue placed the sand for the bound of the sea , by a perpetuall decree that it cannot passe it , and though the waues thereof tosse themselues , yet can they not preuaile , though they roare , yet can they not passe ouer it ?
But this people hath a reuolting and a rebellious heart : they are reuolted and gone .
Neither say they in their heart ; Let vs now feare the Lord our God , that giueth raine , both the former and the later in his season : he reserueth vnto vs the appointed weekes of the haruest .
¶ Your iniquities haue turned away these things , & your sinnes haue withholden good things from you .
For among my people are found wicked men : they lay waite as hee that setteth snares , they set a trap , they catch men .
As a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxen rich .
They are waxen fat , they shine : yea they ouerpasse the deedes of the wicked : they iudge not the cause , the cause of the fatherlesse , yet they prosper : and the right of the needy doe they not iudge .
Shall I not visit for these things , saith the Lord ? shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this ?

Be thou instructed , O Ierusalem , lest my soule depart from thee : lest I make thee desolate , a lande not inhabited .
¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , They shall throughly gleane the remnant of Israel as a vine : turne backe thine hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets .
To whome shall I speake and giue warning , that they may heare ? Behold , their eare is vncircumcised , and they cannot hearken : beholde , the word of the Lord is vnto them a reproch : they haue no delight in it .
Therefore I am full of the furie of the Lord : I am weary with holding in : I will powre it out vpon the children abroad , and vpon the assembly of yong men together : for euen the husband with the wife shall be taken , the aged with him that is full of dayes .
And their houses shall be turned vnto others , with their fields and wiues together : for I wil stretch out my hand vpon the inhabitants of the land , saith the Lord .
For from the least of them euen vnto the greatest of them , euery one is giuen to couetousnesse , and from the prophet euen vnto the priest , euery one dealeth falsly .
They haue healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people sleightly , saying , Peace , peace , when there is no peace .
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall : at the time that I visit them , they shall bee cast downe , saith the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord , Stand ye in the wayes and see , and aske for the old paths , where is the good way , and walke therein , and ye shall finde rest for your soules : but they said , We will not walke therein .

Heare , O earth , behold , I will bring euill vpon this people , euen the fruit of their thoughts , because they haue not hearkened vnto my wordes , nor to my law , but reiected it .
To what purpose commeth there to me incense from Sheba ? and the sweet cane from a farre countrey ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices sweet vnto me .
Therefore thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will lay stumbling blockes before this people , and the fathers and the sons together shall fall vpon them : the neighbor and his friend shall perish .
Thus saith the Lord , Behold , a people commeth from the North countrey , and a great nation shall bee raised from the sides of the earth .
They shall lay hold on bowe and speare : they are cruell , and haue no mercie : their voice roareth like the Sea , and they ride vpon horses , set in aray as men for warre against thee , O daughter of Zion .
We haue heard the fame thereof , our hands waxe feeble , anguish hath taken hold of vs , and paine as of a woman in trauaile .
Goe not forth into the field , nor walke by the way : for the sword of the enemie and feare is on euery side .
¶ O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallowe thy selfe in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an onely sonne , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come vpon vs .
I haue set thee for a towre , and a fortresse among my people : that thou mayest know and trie their way .

Stand in the gate of the Lords house , and proclaime there this word , and say , Heare the word of the Lord , all ye of Iudah , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel ; Amend your wayes , and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
Trust ye not in lying words , saying , The Temple of the Lord , the Temple of the Lord , the Temple of the Lord are these .
For if ye throughly amend your waies and your doings , if you throughly execute iudgement betweene a man and his neighbour :
If ye oppresse not the stranger , the fatherlesse and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walke after other gods to your hurt :
Then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gaue to your fathers , for euer and euer .
¶ Behold , ye trust in lying words , that cannot profit .
Will ye steale , murther , and commit adulterie , and sweare falsly , and burne incense vnto Baal , and walke after other gods , whom ye know not ;
And come and stand before me in this house , which is called by my Name , and say , We are deliuered , to do all these abominations ?
Is this house , which is called by my Name , become a denne of robbers in your eies ? Behold , euen I haue seen it , saith the Lord .
But goe yee now vnto my place which was in Shiloh , where I set my Name at the first , and see what I did to it , for the wickednesse of my people Israel .
And now because ye haue done all these workes , saith the Lord , and I spake vnto you , rising vp earely , and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not :
Therefore will I doe vnto this house , which is called by my Name , wherein yee trust , and vnto the place which I gaue to you , and to your fathers , as I haue done to Shiloh .
And I will cast you out of my sight , as I haue cast out all your brethren , euen the whole seed of Ephraim .
Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift vp cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me , for I will not heare thee .
¶ Seest thou not what they doe in the cities of Iudah , and in the streets of Ierusalem ?
The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , & the women knead their dough to make cakes to the Queene of heauen , and to powre out drinke offerings vnto other gods , that they may prouoke me to anger .
Doe they prouoke mee to anger , saith the Lord ? Doe they not prouoke themselues to the confusion of their owne faces ?
Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold , mine anger and my furie shalbe powred out vpon this place , vpon man & vpon beast , and vpon the trees of the field , and vpon the fruit of the ground , and it shall burne , and shall not be quenched .
¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel , Put your burnt offrings vnto your sacrifices , & eate flesh .
For I spake not vnto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices .
But this thing commaunded I them , saying , Obey my voice , and I wil be your God , and ye shalbe my people : and walke ye in all the wayes that I haue commanded you , that it may be well vnto you .
But they hearkened not , nor inclined their eare , but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their euill heart , and went backward , and not forward .
Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt vnto this day , I haue euen sent vnto you all my seruants the Prophets , daily rising vp early , and sending them .
Yet they hearkned not vnto me , nor inclined their eare , but hardened their neck , they did worse then their fathers .
Therefore thou shalt speake all these wordes vnto them , but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call vnto them , but they will not answere thee .
But thou shalt say vnto them ; This is a nation , that obeyeth not the voyce of the Lord their God , nor receiueth correction : trueth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
¶ Cut off thine haire , O Ierusalem , and cast it away , and take vp a lamentation on high places , for the Lord hath reiected , and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
For the children of Iudah haue done euill in my sight , saith the Lord : they haue set their abominations in the house which is called by my Name , to pollute it .
And they haue built the high places of Tophet which is in the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , to burne their sonnes and their daughters in the fire , which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
¶ Therefore behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Tophet , nor the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Tophet , till there be no place .
And the carkeises of this people shall be meate for the fowles of the heauen , and for the beasts of the earth , and none shall fray them away .
<NON-VERSE>
At that time , sayeth the Lord , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Iudah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the Priests , and the bones of the Prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Ierusalem out of their graues .
And they shall spread them before the Sunne , and the Moone , and all the hoste of heauen whom they haue loued , and whom they haue serued , and after whom they haue walked , and whom they haue sought , and whom they haue worshipped : they shall not be gathered , nor be buried , they shall be for doung , vpon the face of the earth .
And death shall bee chosen rather then life , by all the residue of them that remaine of this euill family , which remaine in all the places whither I haue driuen them , saith the Lord of hosts .
¶ Moreouer thou shalt say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord , Shall they fall , and not arise ? shall hee turne away , and not returne ?
Why then is this people of Ierusalem slidden backe , by a perpetual backesliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to returne .
I hearkened and heard , but they spake not aright : no man repented him of his wickednesse , saying , What haue I done ? euery one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battell .
Yea the Storke in the heauen knoweth her appointed times , and the turtle , and the crane , and the swallow obserue the time of their coming ; but my people know not the iudgement of the Lord .
How doe ye say , We are wise , and the Law of the Lord is with vs ? Loe , certainly , in vaine made he it , the pen of the scribes is in vaine .
The wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken ; loe , they haue reiected the word of the Lord , and what wisedome is in them ?
Therfore will I giue their wiues vnto others , & their fields to them that shall inherite them : for euery one from the least euen vnto the greatest is giuen to couetousnes , from the Prophet euen vnto the priest , euery one dealeth falsly .
For they haue healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace , when there is no peace .
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among them that fal , in the time of their visitation they shall be cast downe , saith the Lord .
¶ I will surely consume them , saith the Lord ; there shalbe no grapes on the vine , nor figges on the figtree , and the leafe shall fade , and the things that I haue giuen them , shall passe away from them .
Why doe wee sit still ? assemble your selues , and let vs enter into the defenced cities , and let vs be silent there : for the Lord our God hath put vs to silence , and giuen vs waters of gall to drink , because we haue sinned against the Lord .
We looked for peace , but no good came : and for a time of health , and behold trouble .
The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan : the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones , for they are come and haue deuoured the land , and all that is in it , the citie , and those that dwell therein .
For behold , I wil send serpents , cockatrices among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you ; saith the Lord .
¶ When I would comfort my selfe against sorrow , my heart is faint in me .
Behold the voice of the crie of the daughter of my people because of them that dwel in a farre countrey : Is not the Lord in Zion ? is not her king in her ? why haue they prouoked me to anger with their grauen images , and with strange vanities ?
The haruest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saued .
For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt , I am blacke : astonishment hath taken hold on me .
<NON-VERSE>
Oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountaine of teares , that I might weepe day and night for the slaine of the daughter of my people .
Oh that I had in the wildernesse a lodging place of wayfaring men , that I might leaue my people , and goe from them : for they be all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
And they bend their tongue like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the trueth vpon the earth : for they proceed from euil to euill , and they know not me , saith the Lord .
Take yee heede euery one of his neighbour , and trust yee not in any brother : for euery brother will vtterly supplant , and euery neighbour will walke with slanders .
And they will deceiue euery one his neighbour , and will not speake the trueth , they haue taught their tongue to speake lies , and weary themselues to commit iniquity .
Thine habitation is in the middest of deceit , through deceit they refuse to know me , sayth the Lord .
Therfore thus saith the Lord of hostes ; Behold , I will melt them , and trie them : for how shall I doe for the daughter of my people ?
Their tongue is as an arrowe shot out , it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he layeth his waite .
¶ Shall I not visit them for these things , saith the Lord ? shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this ?
For the mountaines will I take vp a weeping and wayling , and for the habitations of the wildernesse a lamentation , because they are burnt vp , so that none can passe through them , neither can men heare the voyce of the cattell , both the foule of the heauens , and the beast are fled , they are gone .
And I will make Ierusalem heapes , and a denne of dragons , and I wil make the cities of Iudah desolate , without an inhabitant .
¶ Who is the wise man that may vnderstand this , and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken , that hee may declare it ; for what the land perisheth , and is burnt vp like a wildernesse that none passeth through ?
And the Lord saith ; Because they haue forsaken my law , which I set before them , and haue not obeyed my voyce , neither walked therein ;
But haue walked after the imagination of their owne heart , & after Baalim , which their fathers taught them :
Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , Behold , I will feed them , euen this people with wormewood , and giue them water of gall to drinke .
I will scatter them also among the heathen , whome neither they nor their fathers haue knowen : and I wil send a sword after them , til I haue consumed them .
¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Consider yee , and call for the mourning women , that they may come , and send for cunning women , that they may come .
And let them make haste , and take vp a wailing for vs , that our eyes may run down with teares , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
For a voyce of wayling is heard out of Zion , How are we spoiled ? wee are greatly confounded , because wee haue forsaken the land , because our dwellings haue cast vs out .
Yet heare the word of the Lord , O ye women , & let your eare receiue the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and euery one her neighbour lamentation .
For death is come vp into our windowes , and is entred into our palaces , to cut off the children from without and the yong men from the streetes .
Speake , Thus saith the Lord , Euen the carkeises of men shall fall as dung vpon the open field , and as the handfull after the haruest man , and none shall gather them .
¶ Thus saith the Lord , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches .
But let him that glorieth , glory in this , that hee vnderstandeth and knoweth me , that I am the Lord which exercise louing kindnesse , iudgement and righteousnesse in the earth : for in these things I delight , saith the Lord .
¶ Behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that I will punish all them which are circumcised , with the vncircumcised ,
<NON-VERSE>
Heare ye the word which the Lord speaketh vnto you , O house of Israel .
Thus sayeth the Lord , Learne not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signes of heauen , for the heathen are dismayed at them .
For the customes of the people are vaine : for one cutteth a tree out of the forrest ( the worke of the handes of the workeman ) with the axe .
They decke it with siluer and with golde , they fasten it with nayles , and with hammers that it mooue not .
They are vpright as the palme tree , but speake not : they must needes bee borne , because they cannot goe : be not afraid of them , for they cannot doe euil , neither also is it in them to doe good .
Forasmuch as there is none like vnto thee , O Lord , thou art great , and thy Name is great in might .
Who would not feare thee , O King of nations ? for to thee doeth it appertaine : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdomes , there is none like vnto thee .
But they are altogether brutish and foolish : the stocke is a doctrine of vanities .
Siluer spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the worke of the workeman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the worke of cunning men .
But the Lord is the true God , he is the liuing God , and an euerlasting King : at his wrath the earth shal tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
Thus shal ye say vnto them , The Gods that haue not made the heauens , & the earth , euen they shall perish from the earth , & from vnder these heauens .
Hee hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisedome , and hath stretched out the heauens by his discretion .
When he vttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heauens , and hee causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth : hee maketh lightnings with raine , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
Euery man is brutish in his knowledge , euery founder is confounded by the grauen image : for his moulten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
They are vanity , and the worke of errours : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
The portion of Iacob is not like them : for he is the fourmer of all things , and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the Lord of hostes is his Name .
¶ Gather vp thy wares out of the land , O inhabitant of the fortresse .
For thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distresse them , that they may find it so .
¶ Woe is mee for my hurt , my wound is grieuous : but I sayd , Truely this is a griefe , and I must beare it .
My Tabernacle is spoyled , and all my cordes are broken : my children are gone foorth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch foorth my tent any more , and to set vp my curtaines .
For the Pastours are become brutish , and haue not sought the Lord : therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flockes shall be scattered .
Behold , the noise of the bruit is come , and a great commotion out of the North countrey , to make the cities of Iudah desolate , and a denne of dragons .
¶ O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himselfe : it is not in man that walketh , to direct his steps .
O Lord , correct mee , but with iudgement , not in thine anger , lest thou bring me to nothing .

The word that came to Ieremiah from the Lord , saying ,
Heare yee the words of this Couenant , and speake vnto the men of Iudah , and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem .
And say thou vnto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Cursed bee the man that obeyeth not the words of this Couenant ,
Which I commaunded your fathers in the day that I brought them foorth out of the land of Egypt , from the yron furnace , saying , Obey my voyce , and doe them , according to all which I command you : so shall yee be my people , and I will be your God .
That I may performe the othe which I haue sworne vnto your fathers , to giue them a land flowing with milke and honie , as it is this day : then answered I , and said , So bee it , O Lord .
Then the Lord said vnto me , Proclaime all these wordes in the cities of Iudah , and in the streets of Ierusalem , saying , Heare ye the words of this Couenant , and doe them .
For I earnestly protested vnto your fathers , in the day that I brought them vp out of the land of Egypt , euen vnto this day , rising earely and protesting , saying , Obey my voice .
Yet they obeyed not , nor inclined their eare : but walked euery one in the imagination of their euill heart : therefore I will bring vpon them all the words of this Couenant , which I commaunded them to doe ; but they did them not .
And the Lord said vnto me , A conspiracie is found among the men of Iudah , and among the inhabitants of Ierusalem .
They are turned backe to the iniquities of their forefathers , which refused to heare my wordes : and they went after other gods to serue them : the house of Israel , and the house of Iudah haue broken my Couenant , which I made with their fathers .
For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Iudah , and according to the number of the streetes of Ierusalem haue ye set vp altars to that shamefull thing , euen altars to burne incense vnto Baal .
Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift vp a cry or prayer for them : for I will not heare them in the time that they crie vnto mee for their trouble .
What hath my beloued to doe in mine house , seeing shee hath wrought lewdnesse with many ? and the holy flesh is passed from thee : when thou doest euill , then thou reioycest .
The Lord called thy name , A greene oliue tree , faire and of goodly fruite : with the noise of a great tumult hee hath kindled fire vpon it , and the branches of it are broken .
For the Lord of hostes that planted thee , hath pronounced euill against thee , for the euill of the house of Israel , and of the house of Iudah , which they haue done against themselues to prouoke mee to anger in offering incense vnto Baal .
¶ And the Lord hath giuen mee knowledge of it , and I knowe it , then thou shewedst me their doings .
But I was like a lambe or an oxe that is brought to the slaughter , and I knew not that they had deuised deuices against me , saying ; Let vs destroy the tree with the fruit thereof , and let vs cut him off from the land of the liuing , that his name may be no more remembred .
But , O Lord of hostes , that iudgest righteously , that tryest the reines , and the heart ; let me see thy vengeance on them , for vnto thee haue I reuealed my cause .
Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth , that seeke thy life , saying ; Prophecie not in the Name of the Lord , that thou die not by our hand :
Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , Behold , I wil punish them : the young men shall die by the sword , their sonnes and their daughters shall die by famine .
<NON-VERSE>
Righteous art thou , O Lord , when I pleade with thee : yet let mee talke with thee of thy iudgements : Wherefore doeth the way of the wicked prosper ? Wherefore are all they happie that deale very treacherously ?
Thou hast planted them , yea they haue taken root : they grow , yea they bring foorth fruit , thou art neere in their mouth , and farre from their reines .
But thou , O Lord , knowest me ; thou hast seene me , and tried mine heart towards thee : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
How long shall the land mourne , and the herbes of euery field wither , for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein ? the beasts are consumed , and the birds , because they said ; He shall not see our last end .
¶ If thou hast runne with the footmen , and they haue wearied thee , then how canst thou contend with horses ? And if in the land of peace , wherein thou trustedst , they wearied thee , then how wilt thou doe in the swelling of Iordan ?
For euen thy brethren and the house of thy father , euen they haue dealt treacherously with thee , yea they haue called a multitude after thee ; beleeue them not , though they speake faire words vnto thee .
¶ I haue forsaken mine house : I haue left mine heritage : I haue giuen the dearely beloued of my soule into the hand of her enemies .
Mine heritage is vnto me as a lyon in the forrest : it cryeth out against me , therefore haue I hated it .
Mine heritage is vnto mee as a speckled bird , the birdes round about are against her ; come yee , assemble all the beasts of the field , come to deuoure .
Many pastors haue destroyed my vineyard ; they haue troden my portion vnder foote : they haue made my pleasant portion a desolate wildernesse .
They haue made it desolate , and being desolate it mourneth vnto me ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man layeth it to heart .
The spoilers are come vpon all high places through the wildernesse : for the sword of the Lord shall deuoure from the one end of the land euen to the other end of the land : no flesh shall haue peace .
They haue sowen wheate , but shall reape thornes : they haue put themselues to paine , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of your reuenues , because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
¶ Thus saith the Lord against all mine euill neighbours , that touch the inheritance , which I haue caused my people Israel to inherit ; Behold , I will plucke them out of their land , and plucke out the house of Iudah from among them .
And it shall come to passe after that I haue plucked them out , I will returne , and haue compassion on them , and will bring againe euery man to his heritage , and euery man to his land .
And it shall come to passe , if they will diligently learne the wayes of my people to sweare by my name ( The Lord liueth , as they taught my people to sweare by Baal : ) then shall they be built in the middest of my people .

Thus saith the Lord vnto me ; Goe and get thee a linen girdle , and put it vpon thy loynes , and put it not in water .
So I got a girdle , according to the word of the Lord , and put it on my loines .
And the word of the Lord came vnto me the second time , saying ;
Take the girdle that thou hast got , which is vpon thy loines , and arise , goe to Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rocke .
So I went and hid it by Euphrates , as the Lord commaunded mee .
And it came to passe after many daies , that the Lord saide vnto me ; Arise , goe to Euphrates , and take the girdle from thence , which I commaunded thee to hide there .
Then I went to Euphrates and digged , and tooke the girdle from the place where I had hid it , and behold , the girdle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
Then the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Thus saith the Lord ; After this maner will I marre the pride of Iudah , and the great pride of Ierusalem .
This euill people which refuse to heare my words , which walke in the imagination of their heart , and walke after other Gods to serue them and to worship them , shall euen be as this girdle , which is good for nothing .
For as the girdle cleaueth to the loines of a man : so haue I caused to cleaue vnto me the whole house of Israel , and the whole house of Iudah , saith the Lord ; that they might bee vnto me for a people , and for a name , and for a praise , and for a glory : but they would not heare .
¶ Therefore thou shalt speake vnto them this word ; Thus saith the Lord God of Israel ; Euerie botle shalbe filled with wine : and they shall say vnto thee ; Doe we not certainly know , that euery botle shall be filled with wine ?
Then shalt thou say vnto them ; Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I will fill all the inhabitants of this land , euen the kings that sit vpon Dauids throne , and the priests and the prophets , and all the inhabitants of Ierusalem with drunkennesse .
And I will dash them one against another , euen the fathers and the sonnes together , saith the Lord : I wil not pitie nor spare , nor haue mercie , but destroy them .
¶ Heare ye and giue eare , bee not proud : for the Lord hath spoken .
Giue glory to the Lord your God before he cause darknesse , and before your feet stumble vpon the darke mountaines , and while yee looke for light , he turne it into the shadowe of death , and make it grosse darkenesse .
But if ye will not heare it , my soule shall weepe in secret places for your pride , and mine eye shall weepe sore , and run downe with teares , because the Lords flocke is caried away captiue .
Say vnto the king , and to the queene , Humble your selues , sit downe , for your principalities shall come downe , euen the crowne of your glory .
The cities of the South shall bee shut vp , and none shall open them , Iudah shall be caried away captiue all of it , it shall bee wholly caried away captiue .
Lift vp your eyes , and beholde them that come from the North , where is the flocke that was giuen thee , thy beautifull flocke ?
What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee ( for thou hast taught them to be captaines and as chiefe ouer thee ) shall not sorrowes take thee as a woman in trauaile ?
¶ And if thou say in thine heart , Wherefore come these things vpon me ? for the greatnesse of thine iniquitie are thy skirts discouered , and thy heeles made bare .
Can the Ethiopian change his skinne ? or the leopard his spots ? then may ye also doe good , that are accustomed to doe euill .
Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the winde of the wildernesse .
This is thy lot , the portion of thy measures from me , saith the Lord , because thou hast forgotten mee , and trusted in falshood .
Therefore will I discouer thy skirts vpon thy face , that thy shame may appeare .

The word of the Lord that came to Ieremiah concerning the dearth .
Iudah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish , they are blacke vnto the ground , and the crie of Ierusalem is gone vp .
And their nobles haue sent their litle ones to the waters , they came to the pits and found no water , they returned with the vessels emptie : they were ashamed and confounded , and couered their heads .
Because the ground is chapt , for there was no raine in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed , they couered their heads .
Yea the hinde also calued in the field , and forsooke it , because there was no grasse .
And the wilde asses did stand in the hie places , they snuffed vp the winde like dragons : their eyes did faile because there was no grasse .
¶ O Lord , though our iniquities testifie against vs , doe thou it for thy Names sake : for our back - slidings are many , we haue sinned against thee .
O the hope of Israel , the Sauiour thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man , that turneth aside to tarie for a night ?
Why shouldest thou bee as a man astonied , as a mightie man that cannot saue ? yet thou , O Lord , art in the midst of vs , and we are called by thy Name , leaue vs not .
¶ Thus saith the Lord vnto this people , Thus haue they loued to wander , they haue not refrained their feete , therefore the Lord doeth not accept them , hee will now remember their iniquitie , and visite their sinnes .
Then said the Lord vnto mee , Pray not for this people , for their good .
When they fast I will not heare their crie , and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation I wil not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
¶ Then said I Ah Lord God , behold , the prophets say vnto them ; Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye haue famine , but I will giue you assured peace in this place .
Then the Lord said vnto me , The prophets prophecie lies in my Name , I sent them not , neither haue I commanded them , neither spake vnto them : they prophecie vnto you a false vision and diuination , and a thing of nought , and the deceit of their heart .
Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophecie in my Name , and I sent them not , yet they say , Sword and famine shall not be in this land , By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed .
And the people to whom they prophecie , shall be cast out in the streets of Ierusalem , because of the famine and the sword , and they shall haue none to burie them , them , their wiues , nor their sonnes , nor their daughters : for I will powre their wickednesse vpon them .
¶ Therefore thou shalt say this word vnto them , Let mine eies runne downe with teares night and day , and let them not cease , for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grieuous blow .
If I goe forth into the field , then behold the slaine with the sword , and if I enter into the citie , then behold them that are sicke with famine , yea both the prophet and the priest goe about into a land that they know not .
Hast thou vtterly reiected Iudah ? hath thy soule loathed Zion ? why hast thou smitten vs , and there is no healing for vs ? we looked for peace , and there is no good , and for the time of healing , and behold trouble .
We acknowledge , O Lord , our wickednes , and the iniquitie of our fathers : for wee haue sinned against thee .
Do not abhorre vs , for thy Names sake , doe not disgrace the Throne of thy glorie : remember , breake not thy Couenant with vs .

Then said the Lord vnto me , Though Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my minde could not be toward this people , cast them out of my sight , and let them goe foorth .
And it shall come to passe if they say vnto thee , Whither shall wee goe foorth ? then thou shalt tell them ; Thus saith the Lord , Such as are for death to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword ; and such as are for the famine , to the famine ; and such as are for the captiuitie , to the captiuitie .
And I will appoint ouer them foure kindes , saith the Lord , the sword to slay , and the dogs to teare , and the foules of the heauen , and the beasts of the earth to deuoure and destroy .
And I will cause them to be remoued into all kingdomes of the earth , because of Manasseh the sonne of Hezekiah king of Iudah , for that which hee did in Ierusalem .
For who shall haue pitie vpon thee , O Ierusalem ? or who shall bemoane thee ? or who shall goe aside to aske how thou doest ?
Thou hast forsaken me , saith the Lord , thou art gone backward : therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee , I am wearie with repenting .
And I will fanne them with a fanne in the gates of the land : I will bereaue them of children , I wil destroy my people , sith they returne not from their waies .
Their widowes are increased to me aboue the sand of the seas : I haue brought vpon them against the mother of the yongmen , a spoiler at noone day : I haue caused him to fall vpon it suddenly , and terrors vpon the citie .
She that hath borne seuen , languisheth : she hath giuen vp the ghost : her sunne is gone down while it was yet day : shee hath bene ashamed and confounded , and the residue of them will I deliuer to the sword before their enemies , saith the Lord .
¶ Woe is mee , my mother , that that thou hast borne me a man of strife , and a man of contention to the whole earth : I haue neither lent on vsurie , nor men haue lent to me on vsurie , yet euery one of them doeth curse me .
The Lord said , Uerely it shall be well with thy remnant , verely I will cause the enemie to intreat thee well in the time of euill , and in the time of affliction .
Shall yron breake the Northren yron , and the steele ?
Thy substance and thy treasures will I giue to the spoile without price , and that for all thy sinnes , euen in all thy borders .
And I will make thee to passe with thine enemies , into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger , which shall burne vpon you .
¶ O Lord , thou knowest , remember me , and visit me , and reuenge me of my persecutors , take mee not away in thy long suffering : know that for thy sake I haue suffered rebuke .
Thy wordes were found , and I did eate them , and thy word was vnto mee , the ioy and reioycing of mine heart : for I am called by thy Name , O Lord God of hostes .
I sate not in the assembly of the mockers , nor reioyced : I sate alone because of thy hand : for thou hast filled me with indignation .
Why is my paine perpetuall ? and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed ? wilt thou be altogether vnto me as a lyar , and as waters that faile ?
¶ Therfore thus saith the Lord ; If thou returne , then will I bring thee againe , and thou shalt stand before me : and if thou take forth the precious from the vile , thou shalt be as my mouth : let them returne vnto thee , but returne not thou vnto them .
And I will make thee vnto this people a fenced brasen wall , and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not preuaile against thee : for I am with thee to saue thee , and to deliuer thee , sayth the Lord .

The word of the Lord came also vnto me , saying ;
Thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou haue sonnes nor daughters in this place .
For thus sayth the Lord concerning the sonnes and concerning the daughters that are borne in this place , and concerning their mothers that bare them , and concerning their fathers that begate them in this land :
They shal die of grieuous deaths , they shall not bee lamented , neither shall they be buried : but they shall be as doung vpon the face of the earth , and they shalbe consumed by the sword , and by famine , and their carkeises shall be meate for the foules of heauen , and for the beasts of the earth .
For thus sayth the Lord , Enter not into the house of mourning , neither goe to lament nor bemoane them : for I haue taken away my peace from this people , sayth the Lord , euen louing kindnesse and mercies .
Both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselues , nor make themselues balde for them .
Neither shall men teare themselues for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead , neither shall men giue them the cuppe of consolation to drinke for their father , or for their mother .
Thou shalt not also goe into the house of feasting , to sit with them to eat and to drinke .
For thus sayth the Lord of hostes , the God of Israel : Behold , I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes , and in your dayes , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladnesse , the voice of the bridegroome , and the voice of the bride .
¶ And it shal come to passe when thou shalt shewe this people all these wordes , and they shall say vnto thee ; Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced all this great euill against vs ? or what is our iniquitie ? or what is our sinne , that we haue committed against the Lord our God ?
Then shalt thou say vnto them ; Because your fathers haue forsaken me , saith the Lord , and haue walked after other Gods , and haue serued them , and haue worshipped them , and haue forsaken mee , and haue not kept my law :
And yee haue done worse then your fathers , ( for behold , yee walke euerie one after the imagination of his euill heart , that they may not hearken vnto me . )
Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that yee knowe not , neither yee , nor your fathers , and there shall yee serue other Gods day and night , where I will not shewe you fauour .
¶ Therefore behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be said ; The Lord liueth that brought vp the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
But , The Lord liueth , that brought vp the children of Israel from the land of the North , and from all the lands whither hee had driuen them : and I will bring them againe into their land , that I gaue vnto their fathers .
¶ Behold , I will send for many fishers , saith the Lord , and they shal fish them , and after will I send for manie hunters , and they shall hunt them from euery mountaine , and from euery hill , and out of the holes of the rockes .
For mine eyes are vpon all their waies : they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquitie hid from mine eies .
And first I will recompense their iniquitie , and their sinne double , because they haue defiled my land , they haue filled mine inheritance with the carkeises of their detestable and abominable things .
O Lord , my strength and my fortresse , and my refuge in the day of affliction ; the Gentiles shall come vnto thee from the ends of the earth , and shall say ; Surely our fathers haue inherited lyes , vanitie , and things wherein there is no profit .
Shall a man make Gods vnto himselfe , and they are no Gods ?

The sinne of Iudah is written with a pen of yron , and with the point of a diamond ; it is grauen vpon the table of their heart , and vpon the hornes of your altars :
Whilest their children remember their altars and their groues by the greene trees vpon the high hilles .
O my mountaine , in the field I will giue thy substance , and all thy treasures to the spoile , and thy high places for sinne , throughout all thy borders .
And thou , euen thy selfe shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gaue thee , and I will cause thee to serue thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not : for yee haue kindled a fire in mine anger , which shall burne for euer .
¶ Thus saith the Lord ; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man , and maketh flesh his arme , and whose heart departeth from the Lord .
For hee shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good commeth , but shall inhabite the parched places in the wildernesse , in a salt land and not inhabited .
Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord , and whose hope the Lord is .
For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters , and that spreadeth out her rootes by the riuer , and shall not see when heate commeth , but her leafe shall be greene , and shall not be carefull in the yeere of drought , neither shall cease from yeelding fruit .
¶ The heart is deceitfull aboue all things , and desperately wicked , who can know it ?
I the Lord search the heart , I try the reines , euen to giue euery man according to his waies , and according to the fruit of his doings .
As the partrich sitteth on egges , and hatcheth them not : so he that getteth riches and not by right , shall leaue them in the midst of his dayes , and at his end shall be a foole .
¶ A glorious high throne from the beginning , is the place of our Sanctuarie .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall bee written in the earth , because they haue forsaken the Lord the fountaine of liuing waters .
Heale me , O Lord , and I shall be healed : saue me , and I shalbe saued : for thou art my praise .
¶ Behold , they say vnto mee , Where is the word of the Lord ? let it come now .
As for me , I haue not hastened from being a pastour to follow thee , neither haue I desired the wofull day , thou knowest : that which came out of my lips , was right before thee .
Be not a terrour vnto me , thou art my hope in the day of euill .
Let them bee confounded that persecute me , but let not me be confounded : let them be dismayed , but let not me be dismayed : bring vpon them the day of euill , and destroy them with double destruction .
¶ Thus sayd the Lord vnto me , Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people , whereby the kings of Iudah come in , and by the which they goe out , and in all the gates of Ierusalem .
And say vnto them , Heare ye the word of the Lord , ye kings of Iudah , and all Iudah , and all the inhabitants of Ierusalem , that enter in by these gates .
Thus saith the Lord , Take heed to your selues , and beare no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Ierusalem .
Neither carie forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day , neither doe ye any worke , but hallowe ye the Sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
But they obeyed not , neither inclined their eare , but made their necke stiffe , that they might not heare nor receiue instruction .
And it shall come to passe , if yee diligently hearken vnto me , saith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this citie on the Sabbath day , but hallow the Sabbath day , to doe no worke therein :
Then shall there enter into the gates of this citie kings and princes sitting vpon the throne of Dauid , riding in charets and on horses , they and their princes , the men of Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem : and this citie shall remaine for euer .
And they shall come from the cities of Iudah , and from the places about Ierusalem , and from the lande of Beniamin , and from the plaine and from the mountaines , and from the South , bringing burnt offerings , and sacrifices , and meate offerings , and incense , and bringing sacrifices of praise vnto the house of the Lord .

The word which came to Ieremiah from the Lord saying ,
Arise and go downe to the potters house , & there I will cause thee to heare my words .
Then I went downe to the potters house , and behold , hee wrought a worke on the wheeles .
And the vessell that he made of clay , was marred in the hand of the potter ; so he made it againe another vessell as seemed good to the potter to make it . Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
O house of Israel , cannot I doe with you as this potter , saith the Lord ? Behold , as the clay is in the potters hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
At what instant I shall speake concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdome , to plucke vp and to pull downe , and to destroy it .
If that nation against whom I haue pronounced , turne from their euill , I will repent of the euill that I thought to doe vnto them .
And at what instant I shall speake concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdome to build and to plant it ;
If it doe euill in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then I will repent of the good ; wherewith I saide I would benefite them .
¶ Now therefore goe to , speake to the men of Iudah , and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem , saying , Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I frame euill against you , and deuise a deuice against you : returne ye now euery one from his euill way , and make your waies and your doings good .
And they said , There is no hope , but wee will walke after our owne deuices , and wee will euery one doe the imagination of his euil heart .
Therefore thus saith the Lord , Aske ye now among the heathen , who hath heard such things ? the Uirgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
Will a man leaue the snow of Lebanon which commeth from the rocke of the fielde ? or shall the colde flowing waters that come from another place , be forsaken ?
Because my people hath forgotten mee , they haue burnt incense to vanitie , and they haue caused them to stumble in their waies from the ancient paths , to walke in paths , in a way not cast vp ,
To make their land desolate and a perpetuall hissing : euery one that passeth thereby shall bee astonished , and wagge his head .
I will scatter them as with an East winde before the enemie : I will shew them the backe , and not the face , in the day of their calamitie .
¶ Then said they , Come , and let vs deuise deuices against Ieremiah : for the Law shall not perish from the Priest , nor counsell from the wise , nor the word from the prophet : Come and let vs smite him with the tongue , and let vs not giue heede to any of his wordes .
Giue heed to me , O Lord , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me .
Shall euill bee recompensed for good ? for they haue digged a pit for my soule : remember that I stood before thee to speake good for them , and to turne away thy wrath from them .
Therefore deliuer vp their children to the famine , and powre out their blood by the force of the sword , and let their wiues be bereaued of their children and be widowes , and let their men be put to death , let their yong men be slaine by the sword in battell .
Let a crie bee heard from their houses , when thou shalt bring a troupe suddenly vpon them , for they haue digged a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .

And goe forth vnto the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , which is by the entrie of the Eastgate , and proclaime there the words that I shall tell thee :
And say , Heare ye the word of the Lord , O kings of Iudah , and inhabitants of Ierusalem ; Thus saith the Lord of hostes , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring euill vpon this place , the which whosoeuer heareth , his eares shall tingle .
Because they haue forsaken mee , and haue estranged this place , and haue burnt incense in it vnto other gods , whom neither they , nor their fathers haue knowen , nor the kings of Iudah , and haue filled this place with the blood of innocents .
They haue built also the high places of Baal , to burne their sonnes with fire for burnt offerings vnto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it into my minde .
Therefore behold , the daies come , saith the Lord , that this place shall no more bee called Tophet , nor the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter .
And I will make void the counsell of Iudah and Ierusalem in this place , and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hands of them that seek their liues : and their carkeises will I giue to be meat for the foules of the heauen , and for the beasts of the earth .
And I will make this citie desolate and an hissing : euery one that passeth thereby shalbe astonished and hisse , because of all the plagues thereof .
And I will cause them to eate the flesh of their sonnes and the flesh of their daughters , and they shal eate euery one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitnesse , wherewith their enemies , and they that seeke their liues , shall straiten them .
Then shalt thou breake the bottle in the sight of the men that goe with thee , And shalt say vnto them ; Thus saith the Lord of hostes , Euen so will I breake this people and this citie as one breaketh a potters vessell that cannot bee made whole againe , and they shall bury them in Tophet , till there be no place else to bury .
Thus will I doe vnto this place , sayth the Lord , and to the inhabitants thereof , and euen make their citie as Tophet .
And the houses of Ierusalem , and the houses of the kings of Iudah shall bee defiled as the place of Tophet , because of all the houses vpon whose roofes they haue burnt incense vnto all the hoste of heauen , & haue powred out drinke offrings vnto other gods .
Then came Ieremiah from Tophet , whither the Lord had sent him to prophecie , and hee stood in the court of the Lords house , and said to all the people ,
<NON-VERSE>
Now Pashur the sonne of Immer the Priest , who was also chiefe gouernor in the house of the Lord , heard that Ieremiah prophecied these things .
Then Pashur smote Ieremiah the Prophet , and put him in the stockes that were in the high gate of Beniamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
And it came to passe on the morrow , that Pashur brought foorth Ieremiah out of the stockes . Then sayd Ieremiah vnto him , The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur , but Magor - missabib .
For thus sayth the Lord , Behold , I will make thee a terrour to thy selfe , and to all thy friends , and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies , and thine eyes shall behold it , and I will giue all Iudah into the hand of the king of Babylon , and hee shall cary them captiue into Babylon , and shall slay them with the sword .
Moreouer , I will deliuer all the strength of this city , and all the labours thereof , and all the precious things thereof , and all the treasures of the kings of Iudah will I giue into the hand of their enemies which shal spoile them , and take them and cary them to Babylon .
And thou Pashur , and all that dwell in thine house , shall goe into captiuitie , and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophecied lies .
¶ O Lord , thou hast deceiued me , and I was deceiued , thou art stronger then I , and hast preuailed : I am in derision daily , euery one mocketh me .
For since I spake I cryed out , I cried violence and spoyle ; because the word of the Lord was made a reproch vnto me , and a derision daily ?
Then I said ; I will not make mention of him , nor speake any more in his name . But his word was in mine heart , as a burning fire shut vp in my bones , and I was weary with forbearing , and I could not stay .
¶ For I heard the defaming of many , feare on euery side . Report , say they , and wee will report it : all my familiars watched for my halting , saying ; Peraduenture he will be enticed : and we shall preuaile against him , and we shall take our reuenge on him .
But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutours shall stumble , and they shall not preuaile , they shall be greatly ashamed , for they shall not prosper , their euerlasting confusion shall neuer be forgotten .
But O Lord of hostes , that tryest the righteous , and seest the reines and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for vnto thee haue I opened my cause .
Sing vnto the Lord , praise yee the Lord : for hee hath deliuered the soule of the poore from the hand of euill doers .
¶ Cursed be the day wherein I was borne : let not the day wherein my mother bare mee , be blessed .
Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying : A man child is borne vnto thee , making him very glad .
And let that man be as the cities which the Lord ouerthrew and repented not : and let him heare the cry in the morning , and the shouting at noonetide ,
Because he slew me not from the wombe : or that my mother might haue beene my graue , and her wombe to be alwaies great with me .

The word which came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord , when king Zedekiah sent vnto him Pashur the sonne of Melchiah , and Zephaniah the sonne of Maaseiah the priest , saying ;
Enquire , I pray thee , of the Lord for vs ( for Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon maketh warre against vs ) if so be that the Lord will deale with vs , according to all his wondrous workes , that he may goe vp from vs .
¶ Then saide Ieremiah vnto them . Thus shall yee say to Zedekiah ,
Thus saith the Lord God of Israel ; Behold , I will turne backe the weapons of warre that are in your hands , wherewith yee fight against the king of Babylon , and against the Caldeans , which besiege you without the walles , and I will assemble them into the middest of this citie .
And I myselfe will fight against you with an out stretched hand , and with a strong arme , euen in anger , and in furie , and in great wrath .
And I will smite the inhabitants of this citie both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
And afterward , saith the Lord , I will deliuer Zedekiah king of Iudah , and his seruants , and the people , and such as are left in this citie from the pestilence , from the sword , and from the famine , into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those that seeke their life , and and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword : hee shall not spare them , neither haue pitie , nor haue mercy .
¶ And vnto this people thou shalt say ; Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
He that abideth in this citie , shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth out , and falleth to the Caldeans , that besiege you , he shall liue , and his life shall be vnto him , for a pray .
For I haue set my face against this citie for euill and not for good , saith the Lord ; it shall be giuen into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burne it with fire . ¶ And touching the house of the king of Iudah , say ; Heare yee the word of the Lord .
Oh house of Dauid , thus saith the Lord , Execute iudgement in the morning , and deliuer him that is spoiled , out of the hand of the oppressour , lest my furie goe out like fire , and burne , that none can quench it , because of the euill of your doings .
Behold , I am against thee , O inhabitant of the valley , and rocke of the plaine , saith the Lord , which say , Who shall come downe against vs ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?

Thus saith the Lord , Goe downe to the house of the king of Iudah , and speake there this word ,
And say , Heare the word of the Lord , O king of Iudah , that sittest vpon the throne of Dauid , thou , and thy seruants , and thy people that enter in by these gates .
Thus saith the Lord , Execute ye iudgement and righteousnesse , and deliuer the spoiler out of the hand of the oppressour : and doe no wrong , doe no violence to the stranger , the fatherlesse , nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
For if ye doe this thing indeede , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house , Kings sitting vpon the throne of Dauid , riding in charets and on horses , he , and his seruants , and his people .
But if yee will not heare these words , I sweare by my selfe , saith the Lord , that this house shall become a desolation .
For thus saith the Lord vnto the kings house of Iudah , Thou art Gilead vnto me , and the head of Lebanon : yet surely I will make thee a wildernesse , and cities which are not inhabited .
And I will prepare destroyers against thee , euery one with his weapons , and they shall cut downe thy choise cedars , and cast them into the fire .
And many nations shall passe by this citie , and they shall say euery man to his neighbour , Wherefore hath the Lord done thus vnto this great citie ?
Then they shall answere , Because they haue forsaken the couenant of the Lord their God , and worshipped other gods , and serued them .
¶ Weepe ye not for the dead , neither bemoane him , but weepe sore for him that goeth away : for he shall returne no more , nor see his natiue countrey .
For thus saith the Lord touching Shallum , the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah which reigned in stead of Iosiah his father , which went forth out of this place , He shall not returne thither any more .
But he shall die in the place whither they haue led him captiue , and shal see this land no more .
¶ Woe vnto him that buildeth his house by vnrighteousnesse , and his chambers by wrong : that vseth his neighbours seruice without wages , and giueth him not for his worke :
That saith , I will build mee a wide house and large chambers , and cutteth him out windowes , and it is sieled with cedar , and painted with vermilion .
Shalt thou reigne because thou closest thy selfe in cedar ? did not thy father eate and drinke , and doe iudgment and iustice , and then it was wel with him ?
He iudged the cause of the poore and needy , then it was well with him : was not this to know me , saith the Lord ?
But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy couetousnesse , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence to doe it .
Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah , They shall not lament for him , saying , Ah my brother , or ah sister : they shall not lament for him , saying , Ah Lord , or ah his glory .
He shall be buried with the buriall of an asse , drawen and cast forth beyond the gates of Ierusalem .
¶ Goe vp to Lebanon , and crie , and lift vp thy voice in Bashan , and crie from the passages : for all thy louers are destroyed .
I spake vnto thee in thy prosperitie , but thou saidest , I will not heare : this hath bin thy maner from thy youth , that thou obeyedst not my voice .
The winde shall eate vp all thy pastors , and thy louers shall goe into captiuitie , surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickednesse .
O inhabitant of Lebanon , that makest thy nest in the Cedars , how gracious shalt thou bee when pangs come vpon thee , the paine as of a woman in trauell ?
As I liue , saith the Lord , though Coniah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah were the signet vpon my right hand , yet would I plucke thee thence .
And I will giue thee into the hand of them that seeke thy life , and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest , euen into the hand of Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Caldeans .
And I will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another countrey where ye were not borne , and there shall ye die .
But to the land whereunto they desire to returne , thither shall they not returne .
Is this man Coniah a despised broken idole ? is hee a vessell wherein is no pleasure ? wherefore are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
O earth , earth , earth , heare the word of the Lord :

Woe bee vnto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheepe of my pasture , saith the Lord .
Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people ; Yee haue scattered my flocke and driuen them away , and haue not visited them ; behold I will visite vpon you the euill of your doings , saith the Lord .
And I wil gather the remnant of my flocke , out of all countreis whither I haue driuen them , and will bring them againe to their foldes , and they shalbe fruitfull and increase .
And I will set vp shepheards ouer them which shall feed them , and they shal feare no more nor be dismaied , neither shall they bee lacking , saith the Lord .
¶ Behold , the daies come , saith the Lord , that I wil raise vnto Dauid a righteous branch , and a King shall reigne and prosper , and shall execute iudgement and iustice in the earth .
In his dayes Iudah shalbe saued , and Israel shall dwell safely , and this is his Name whereby hee shall be called , The Lord Our Righteousnes .
Therefore behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that they shall no more say ; The Lord liueth , which brought vp the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt :
But , The Lord liueth , which brought vp , and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the North countrey , and from all countreis whither I had driuen them , and they shall dwell in their owne land .
¶ Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets , all my bones shake : I am like a drunken man ( and like a man whom wine hath ouercome ) because of the Lord , and because of the words of his Holinesse .
For the land is full of adulterers , for because of swearing the land mourneth : the pleasant places of the wildernes are dried vp , and their course is euil , and their force is not right .
For both prophet and priest are prophane , yea in my house haue I found their wickednesse , saith the Lord .
Wherefore their way shalbe vnto them as slippery wayes in the darkenes : they shalbe driuen on and fall therein : for I will bring euill vpon them , euen the yeere of their visitation , saith the Lord .
And I haue seene folly in the prophets of Samaria ; they prophecied in Baal , and caused my people Israel to erre .
I haue seene also in the prophets of Ierusalem an horrible thing : they commit adultery , and walke in lies : they strengthen also the hands of euill doers , that none doeth returne from his wickednesse : they are all of them vnto me as Sodom , and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah .
Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the Prophets ; Behold , I will feede them with wormewood , and make them drinke the water of gall : for from the Prophets of Ierusalem is profanenesse gone forth into all the land .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Hearken not vnto the wordes of the prophets that prophecie vnto you ; they make you vaine : they speake a vision of their owne heart , and not out of the mouth of the Lord .
They say still vnto them that despise me ; The Lord hath sayde , Yee shall haue peace ; and they say vnto euery one that walketh after the imagination of his owne heart , No euill shall come vpon you .
The anger of the Lord shall not returne , vntill hee haue executed , and til he haue performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter dayes ye shall consider it perfectly .
I haue not sent these prophets , yet they ranne : I haue not spoken to them , yet they prophecied .
But if they had stood in my counsell , and had caused my people to heare my wordes , then they should haue turned them from their euil way , and from the euill of their doings .
Am I a God at hand , sayth the Lord , and not a God afarre off ?
Can any hide himselfe in secret places that I shall not see him , saith the Lord ? doe not I fill heauen and earth , sayth the Lord ?
I haue heard what the prophets said , that prophecie lyes in my Name , saying ; I haue dreamed , I haue dreamed .
How long shall this bee in the heart of the prophets that prophecie lies ? yea they are prophets of the deceit of their owne heart ;
Which thinke to cause my people to forget my Name by their dreames which they tell euery man to his neighbour , as their fathers haue forgotten my Name , for Baal .
The prophet that hath a dreame , let him tell a dreame ; and hee that hath my word , let him speake my word faithfully : what is the chaffe to the wheat , sayth the Lord ?
Is not my word like as a fire , saith the Lord ? and like a hammer that breaketh the rocke in pieces ? Therefore , behold , I am against the prophets , sayth the Lord , that steale my worde euery one from his neighbour .
Beholde , I am against the prophets , saith the Lord , that vse their tongues , and say ; He sayth .
Behold , I am against them that prophecie false dreames , sayeth the Lord , and doe tell them , and cause my people to erre by their lyes and by their lightnesse , yet I sent them not , nor commanded them : therefore they shall not profite this people at all , sayth the Lord .
¶ And when this people , or the prophet , or a priest shall aske thee , saying ; What is the burden of the Lord ? thou shalt then say vnto them ; What burden ? I will euen forsake you , saith the Lord .
And as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people that shal say , The burden of the Lord , I will euen punish that man and his house .
Thus shall yee say euery one to his neighbour , and euery one to his brother , What hath the Lord answered ? and what hath the Lord spoken ?
And the burden of the Lord shall yee mention no more : for euery mans word shall be his burden : for yee haue peruerted the words of the liuing God , of the Lord of hostes our God .
Thus shalt thou say to the prophet , What hath the Lord answered thee ? and what hath the Lord spoken ?
But sith ye say , The burden of the Lord ; therefore thus sayeth the Lord , Because you say this word , The burden of the Lord , and I haue sent vnto you , saying ; Ye shall not say , The burden of the Lord :
Therefore beholde , I , euen I will vtterly forget you , and I will forsake you , and the citie that I gaue you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence .

The Lord shewed mee , and behold , two baskets of figges were set before the temple of the Lord , after that Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon had caried away captiue Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah , and the princes of Iudah , with the carpenters and smiths from Ierusalem , and had brought them to Babylon .
One basket had very good figges , euen like the figges that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figges , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
Then said the Lord vnto me ; What seest thou Ieremiah ? and I said : Figges : the good figges , very good and the euill , very euill , that cannot be eaten , they are so euill .
¶ Againe , the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , Like these good figges , so will I acknowledge them that are caried away captiue of Iudah , whom I haue sent out of this place into the land of the Caldeans for their good .
For I will set mine eyes vpon them for good , and I will bring them againe to this land , and I will build them , and not pull them downe , and I will plant them , and not plucke them vp .
And I will giue them an heart to know me , that I am the Lord , and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall returne vnto me with their whole heart .
¶ And as the euill figges which cannot be eaten , they are so euill ; ( Surely thus saith the Lord ) so will I giue Zedekiah the king of Iudah , and his princes , and the residue of Ierusalem , that remaine in this land , and them that dwell in the land of Egypt .
And I will deliuer them to be remoued into all the kingdomes of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproch and a prouerbe , a taunt and a curse in all places whither I shall driue them .
<NON-VERSE> The word that came to Ieremiah concerning all the people of Iudah , in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah , that was the first yeere of Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon :
The which Ieremiah the prophet spake vnto all the people of Iudah , and to all the inhabitants of Ierusalem , saying ;
From the thirteenth yere of Iosiah the sonne of Amon king of Iudah , euen vnto this day ( that is the three and twentith yeere ) the word of the Lord hath come vnto me , and I haue spoken vnto you , rising early and speaking , but yee haue not hearkened .
And the Lord hath sent vnto you all his seruants the prophets , rising early and sending them , but yee haue not hearkened , nor inclined your eare to heare .
They sayd , Turne yee againe now euery one from his euill way , and from the euil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the Lord hath giuen vnto you , and to your fathers for euer and euer .
And goe not after other Gods to serue them , and to worship them , and prouoke mee not to anger with the workes of your hands , and I will doe you no hurt .
Yet yee haue not hearkened vnto me , saith the Lord , that yee might prouoke me to anger with the workes of your hands , to your owne hurt .
¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hostes ; Because yee haue not heard my words :
Behold , I will send and take all the families of the North , saith the Lord , and Nebuchad - rezzar the king of Babylon my seruant , and will bring them against this land , and against the inhabitants thereof , and against all these nations round about , and will vtterly destroy them , and make them an astonishment , and an hissing , and perpetuall desolations .
Moreouer , I will take from them the voyce of myrth , and the voice of gladnes , the voice of the bridegrome , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the milstones , & the light of the candle .
And this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment , and these nations shal serue the king of Babylon seuentie yeeres .
¶ And it shall come to passe when seuentie yeeres are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation , saith the Lord , for their iniquitie , and the land of the Caldeans , and will make it perpetuall desolations .
And I will bring vpon that land all my words which I haue pronounced against it , euen all that is written in this booke , which Ieremiah hath prophecied against all the nations .
For many nations and great kings shall serue themselues of them also : and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the workes of their owne hands .
¶ For thus saith the Lord God of Israel vnto me , Take the wine cup of this furie at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send thee , to drinke it .
And they shall drinke , and be moued , and be mad , because of the sworde that I will send among them .
Then tooke I the cuppe at the Lords hand , and made all the nations to drinke , vnto whom the Lord had sent me :
To wit Ierusalem , and the cities of Iudah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ( as it is this day : )
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his seruants , and his princes , and all his people :
And all the mingled people , & all the kings of the land of Uz : and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod :
Edom , and Moab , and the children of Ammon :
And all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the yles which are beyond the sea :
Dedan , and Tema , and Buz , and all that are in the vtmost corners :
And all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert :
And all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes :
And all the kings of the North , farre and neere , one with another , and all the kingdomes of the world , which are vpon the face of the earth , and the king of Sheshach shall drinke after them .
Therefore thou shalt say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , Drinke ye and bee drunken , and spue and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I wil send among you .
And it shall bee , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drinke , then shalt thou say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Yee shall certainely drinke .
For loe , I begin to bring euill on the citie , which is called by my name , and should yee be vtterly vnpunished ? ye shall not be vnpunished : for I will cal for a sword vpon all the inhabitants of the earth , saith the Lord of hosts .
Therefore prophecie thou against them all these wordes , and say vnto them , The Lord shall roare from an high , and vtter his voice from his holy habitation , he shall mightily roare vpon his habitation , hee shall giue a shout , as they that treade the grapes , against all the inhabitants of the earth .
A noise shall come euen to the ends of the earth ; for the Lord hath a controuersie with the nations : hee will pleade with all flesh , he will giue them that are wicked to the sword , saith the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Behold , euill shall goe forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlewinde shall be raised vp from the coasts of the earth .
And the slaine of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth euen vnto the other ende of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered nor buried , they shall be doung vpon the ground .
¶ Howle yee shepheards and cry , and wallow your selues in the ashes ye principall of the flocke : for the dayes of your slaughter , and of your dispersions are accomplished , and yee shall fall like a pleasant vessell .
And the shepheards shall haue no way to flee , nor the principall of the flocke to escape .
A voyce of the cry of the shepheards , and an howling of the principall of the flocke shall be heard : for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture .
And the peaceable habitations are cut downe because of the fierce anger of the Lord .

In the beginning of the reigne of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah , came this word from the Lord , saying ;
Thus saith the Lord , Stand in the Court of the Lords house , and speake vnto all the cities of Iudah , which come to worship in the Lords house , all the wordes that I command thee to speake vnto them : diminish not a word ;
If so bee they will hearken , and turne euery man from his euill way , that I may repent me of the euil which I purpose to doe vnto them , because of the euil of their doings .
And thou shalt say vnto them , Thus saith the Lord ; If yee will not hearken to mee to walke in my Law , which I haue set before you ,
To hearken to the wordes of my seruants the Prophets , whom I sent vnto you , both rising vp early and sending them , ( but ye haue not hearkned : )
Then wil I make this house like Shiloh , and wil make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth . So the priests and the prophets , and all the people heard Ieremiah speaking these wordes in the house of the Lord .
¶ Now it came to passe when Ieremiah had made an ende of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speake vnto all the people , that the priests and the prophets , and all the people tooke him , saying ; Thou shalt surely die .
Why hast thou prophecied in the Name of the Lord , saying , This house shalbe like Shiloh , and this city shalbe desolate without an inhabitant ? And all the people were gathered against Ieremiah in the house of the Lord .
¶ Then spake Ieremiah vnto all the Princes , and to all the people , saying , The Lord sent me to prophecie against this house , and against this citie , all the wordes that yee haue heard .
Therefore nowe amend your wayes , and your doings , and obey the voice of the Lord your God , and the Lord will repent him of the euill that he hath pronounced against you .
As for mee , behold , I am in your hand : doe with mee as seemeth good and meet vnto you .
But know ye for certaine , That if ye put mee to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood vpon your selues , and vpon this citie , and vpon the inhabitants thereof : for of a trueth the Lord hath sent mee vnto you , to speake all these words in your eares .
¶ Then said the Princes , and all the people , vnto the priests , and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for hee hath spoken to vs in the Name of the Lord our God .
Then rose vp certaine of the Elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ;
Micah the Morashite prophecied in the dayes of Hezekiah king of Iudah , and spake to all the people of Iudah , saying ; Thus saith the Lord of hostes , Zion shall be plowed like a field , and Ierusalem shall become heapes , and the mountaine of the house , the hie places of a forrest .
Did Hezekiah King of Iudah and all Iudah put him at all to death ? did hee not feare the Lord , and besought the Lord , and the Lord repented him of the euill which he had pronounced against them ? thus might wee procure great euill against our soules .
And there was also a man that prophecied in the Name of the Lord , Urijah the sonne of Shemaiah of Kiriath - iearim , who prophecied against this citie and against this land , according to all the words of Ieremiah .
And when Iehoiakim the king with all his mightie men , and all the princes heard his wordes , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid and fled , and went into Egypt .
And Iehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely Elnathan the sonne of Achbor , and certeine men with him , into Egypt .
And they fet foorth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him vnto Iehoiakim the king , who slewe him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graues of the common people .

In the beginning of the reigne of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah King of Iudah , came this worde vnto Ieremiah from the Lord , saying ,
Thus sayth the Lord to me , Make thee bonds and yokes , and put them vpon thy necke .
And send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the Ammonites , and to the king of Tyrus , and to the king of Zidon , by the hand of the messengers which come to Ierusalem vnto Zedekiah king of Iudah .
And command them to say vnto their masters , Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel , Thus shall ye say vnto your masters :
I haue made the earth , the man and the beast that are vpon the ground , by my great power , and by my outstretched arme , and haue giuen it vnto whom it seemed meet vnto me .
And now haue I giuen all these landes into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my seruant , and the beasts of the field haue I giuen him also to serue him .
And all nations shall serue him and his sonne , and his sonnes sonne , vntill the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serue themselues of him .
And it shall come to passe , that the nation and kingdome which will not serue the same Nebuchad - nezzar the king of Babylon , and that will not put their necke vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon , that nation will I punish , sayth the Lord , with the sword , and with the famine , and with the pestilence , vntill I haue consumed them by his hand .
Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets , nor to your diuiners , nor to your dreamers , nor to your inchanters , nor to your sorcerers , which speak vnto you , saying ; Ye shall not serue the king of Babylon :
For they prophecie a lie vnto you , to remooue you farre from your land , and that I should driue you out , and ye should perish .
But the nations that bring their necke vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serue him , those will I let remaine still in their owne land , sayth the Lord , and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
¶ I spake also to Zedekiah king of Iudah according to all these wordes , saying , Bring your neckes vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serue him and his people , and liue .
Why will yee die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serue the king of Babylon ?
Therefore hearken not vnto the words of the prophets , that speake vnto you , saying ; Yee shall not serue the king of Babylon : for they prophecie a lie vnto you .
For I haue not sent them , saith the Lord , yet they prophecie a lye in my name , that I might driue you out , & that yee might perish , ye , and the prophets that prophecie vnto you .
Also I spake to the priests , and to all this people , saying ; Thus saith the Lord , Hearken not to the words of your prophets , that prophecie vnto you , saying ; Behold , the vessels of the Lords house shall now shortly be brought againe from Babylon ; for they prophecie a lie vnto you .
Hearken not vnto them : serue the king of Babylon , and liue : wherefore should this citie be laid waste ?
But if they be prophets , and if the word of the Lord be with them , let them nowe make intercession to the Lord of hostes , that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Iudah , and at Ierusalem , goe not to Babylon .
¶ For thus saith the Lord of hostes concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the residue of the vessels that remaine in this citie ,
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon tooke not , when he caried away captiue Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah , from Ierusalem to Babylon , and all the nobles of Iudah and Ierusalem :
Yea thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remaine in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Iudah and of Ierusalem ;

And it came to passe the same yeere , in the beginning of the reigne of Zedekiah king of Iudah , in the fourth yeere , and in the fift moneth , that Hananiah the sonne of Azur the prophet , which was of Gibeon , spake vnto mee in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ;
Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes , the God of Israel , saying ; I haue broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
Within two full yeeres will I bring againe into this place all the vessels of the Lords house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon tooke away from this place , and caried them to Babylon .
And I will bring againe to this place Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah , with all the captiues of Iudah , that went into Babylon , saith the Lord , for I will breake the yoke of the king of Babylon .
¶ Then the prophet Ieremiah said vnto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people , that stood in the house of the Lord ,
Euen the prophet Ieremiah said ; Amen : the Lord doe so , the Lord performe the words which thou hast prophecied , to bring againe the vessels of the Lords house , and all that is caried away captiue from Babylon into this place .
Neuerthelesse , heare thou now this word that I speake in thine eares , and in the eares of all the people .
The prophets that haue beene before mee , and before thee of old , prophecied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of warre , and of euill , and of pestilence .
The prophet which prophecieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to passe , then shall the prophet be knowen , that the Lord hath truely sent him . ¶ Then Hananiah the prophet tooke the yoke from off the prophet Ieremiahs necke , and brake it .
And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people , saying ; Thus saith the Lord , Euen so will I breake the yoke of Nebuchadnezzer king of Babylon from the necke of all nations within the space of two full yeeres : and the Prophet Ieremiah went his way . ¶ Then the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah the Prophet ( after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the necke of the Prophet Ieremiah ) saying ,
Goe , and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus saith the Lord , Thou hast broken the yokes of wood , but thou shalt make for them yokes of yron .
For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , I haue put a yoke of yron vpon the neck of all these nations , that they may serue Nebuchad - nezzar king of Babylon , and they shall serue him , and I haue giuen him the beasts of the field also .
¶ Then said the Prophet Ieremiah vnto Hananiah the prophet , Heare nowe Hananiah : the Lord hath not sent thee , but thou makest this people to trust in a lye .
Therefore thus saith the Lord , Beholde , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this yeere thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord .

Now these are the words of the letter , that Ieremiah the prophet sent from Ierusalem vnto the residue of the elders which were caried away captiues , and to the priests , and to the prophets , and to all the people whom Nebuchad - nezzar had caried away captiue from Ierusalem to Babylon ,
( After that Ieconiah the king , and the queene , and the eunuches , the princes of Iudah and Ierusalem , and the carpenters and the smithes were departed from Ierusalem )
By the hand of Elasah the sonne of Shaphan , and Gemariah the sonne of Hilkiah , whome Zedekiah king of Iudah sent vnto Babylon to Nebuchad - nezzar king of Babylon , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel vnto all that are caried away captiues , whom I haue caused to be caried away from Ierusalem vnto Babylon :
Build ye houses and dwell in them , and plant gardens , and eate the fruit of them .
Take ye wiues , and beget sonnes and daughters , and take wiues for your sonnes , and giue your daughters to husbands , that they may beare sonnes and daughters , that ye may bee increased there , and not diminished .
And seeke the peace of the citie , whither I haue caused you to be caried away captiues , & pray vnto the Lord for it : for in the peace thereof shall yee haue peace .
¶ For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , Let not your prophets and your diuiners , that bee in the midst of you , deceiue you , neither hearken to your dreames which yee cause to be dreamed .
For they prophecie falsly vnto you in my name : I haue not sent them , saith the Lord .
¶ For thus saith the Lord , That after seuentie yeeres be accomplished at Babylon , I will visite you , and performe my good word towards you , in causing you to returne to this place .
For I knowe the thoughts that I thinke towards you , saith the Lord , thoughts of peace , and not of euill , to giue you an expected end .
Then shall ye call vpon me , and ye shall goe and pray vnto mee , and I will hearken vnto you .
And ye shall seeke me , and finde me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
And I will be found of you , saith the Lord , and I will turne away your captiuitie , and I will gather you from all the nations , and from all the places whither I haue driuen you , saith the Lord , and I will bring you againe into the place whence I caused you to be caried away captiue .
¶ Because yee haue said , The Lord hath raised vs vp prophets in Babylon :
Know that thus saith the Lord , of the king that sitteth vpon the throne of Dauid , and of all the people that dwelleth in this citie , and of your brethren that are not gone foorth with you into captiuitie .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Beholde , I will send vpon them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figges , that cannot be eaten , they are so euill .
And I will persecute them with the sword , with the famine , and with the pestilence , and will deliuer them to be remooued to all the kingdomes of the earth , to be a curse and an astonishment , and an hissing , and a reproch among all the nations , whither I haue driuen them .
Because they haue not hearkened to my words , saith the Lord , which I sent vnto them by my seruants the Prophets , rising vp early , and sending them , but ye would not heare , saith the Lord .
¶ Heare yee therefore the word of the Lord , all ye of the captiuitie , whom I haue sent from Ierusalem to Babylon .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel , of Ahab the sonne of Kolaiah , and of Zedekiah the sonne of Maaseiah , which prophecie a lye vnto you in my Name , Behold , I will deliuer them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and hee shall slay them before your eyes .
And of them shall bee taken vp a eurse by all the captiuitie of Iudah which are in Babylon , saying , The Lord make thee like Zedekiah , and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon rosted in the fire .
Because they haue committed villanie in Israel , and haue committed adulterie with their neighbors wiues , and haue spoken lying wordes in my Name , which I haue not commanded them , euen I know , and am a witnesse , saith the Lord .
¶ Thus shalt thou also speake to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying :
Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in thy name vnto all the people that are at Ierusalem , and to Zephaniah the sonne of Maaseiah the Priest , and to all the priests , saying ;
The Lord hath made thee Priest in the stead of Iehoiada the Priest , that ye should be Officers in the house of the Lord , for euery man that is madde , and maketh himselfe a Prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stockes :
Now therefore why hast thou not reproued Ieremiah of Anathoth , which maketh himselfe a Prophet to you ?
For therefore he sent vnto vs in Babylon , saying , This captiuitie is long , build ye houses and dwell in them , and plant gardens , and eate the fruit of them .
And Zephaniah the Priest read this letter in the eares of Ieremiah the Prophet .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah , saying ;
Send to all them of the captiuitie , saying , Thus saith the Lord , concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite , Because that Shemaiah hath prophecied vnto you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lye .

¶ And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel , and concerning Iudah .
For thus sayth the Lord , Wee haue heard a voice of trembling , of feare , and not of peace .
Aske yee now and see whether a man doeth trauaile with child ? wherefore doe I see euery man with his handes on his loynes , as a woman in trauaile , and all faces are turned into palenesse ?
Alas , for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is euen the time of Iacobs trouble , but he shall be saued out of it .
For it shall come to passe in that day , saith the Lord of hostes , that I will breake his yoke from off thy necke , and will burst thy bondes , and strangers shall no more serue themselues of him .
But they shall serue the Lord their God , and Dauid their King whom I will raise vp vnto them .
¶ Therefore feare thou not , O my seruant Iacob , saith the Lord , neither be dismayed , O Israel ; for loe , I will saue thee from afarre , and thy seede from the land of their captiuitie , and Iacob shall returne , and shall be in rest , and be quiet , and none shall make him afraid .
For I am with thee , sayeth the Lord , to saue thee : though I make a full end of all nations whither I haue scattered thee , yet will I not make a full ende of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leaue thee altogether vnpunished .
For thus saith the Lord , Thy bruise is incurable , and thy wound is grieuous .
There is none to pleade thy cause , that thou mayest bee bonnd vp : thou hast no healing medicines .
All thy louers haue forgotten thee : they seeke thee not , for I haue wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruell one , for the multitude of thine iniquitie : because thy sinnes were increased .
Why cryest thou for thine affliction ? thy sorrow is incurable , for the multitude of thine iniquitie : because thy sinnes were increased , I haue done these things vnto thee .
Therefore all they that deuoure thee shalbe deuoured , and all thine aduersaries euery one of them shall goe into captiuitie : and they that spoile thee shall be a spoile , and all that pray vpon thee , will I giue for a pray .
For I will restore health vnto thee , and I will heale thee of thy wounds , sayth the Lord , because they called thee an outcast , saying ; This is Zion whom no man seeketh after .
¶ Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will bring againe the captiuitie of Iacobs tents , and haue mercie on his dwelling places : and the citie shall be builded vpon her owne heape , and the palace shall remaine after the manner thereof .
And out of them shall proceede thankesgiuing , and the voice of them that make merry ; and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few : I will also glorifie them , and they shall not be small .
Their children also shall be as aforetime , and their congregation shalbe established before me , and I will punish all that oppresse them .
And their nobles shall be of themselues , and their gouernour shall proceede from the middest of them , and I will cause him to draw neere , and hee shall approch vnto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approch vnto me , sayth the Lord ?

Thou shalt yet plant vines vpon the mountaines of Samaria , the planters shall plant , and shall eate them as common things .
For there shall be a day , that the watchmen vpon the mount Ephraim shall cry ; Arise yee , and let vs goe vp to Zion vnto the Lord our God .

Behold , I will bring them from the North countrey , and gather them from the coasts of the earth , and with them the blind and the lame , the woman with child , and her that trauelleth with child together , a great company shall returne thither .
They shall come with weeping , and with supplications will I leade them : I will cause them to walke by the riuers of waters , in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble : for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my first borne .
¶ Heare the word of the Lord , O yee nations , and declare it in the iles afarre off , and say ; Hee that scattered Israel will gather him , and keepe him as a shepheard doth his flocke .
For the Lord hath redeemed Iacob , and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger then hee .
Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion , and shall flow together to the goodnesse of the Lord , for wheate , and for wine , and for oyle , and for the young of the flocke and of the herd : and their soule shall be as a watered garden , and they shall not sorrow any more at all .
Then shall the virgine reioyce in the daunce , both yoong men and old together : for I will turne their mourning into ioy , and will comfort them , and make them reioyce from their sorrow .
And I will satiate the soule of the priests with fatnesse , and my people shall be satisfied with goodnesse , saith the Lord .
¶ Thus saith the Lord ; A voyce was heard in Ramah , lamentation and bitter weeping : Rahel weeping for her children , refused to be comforted for her children , because they were not .

And there is hope in thine end , saith the Lord , that thy children shall come againe to their owne border .
¶ I haue surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himselfe thus , Thou hast chastised me , and I was chastised , as a bullocke vnaccustomed to the yoke : turne thou me , and I shall be turned ; thou art the Lord my God .
Surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote vpon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea euen confounded , because I did beare the reproch of my youth .
Is Ephraim my deare sonne ? is he a pleasant child ? for since I spake against him , I doe earnestly remember him still : therefore my bowels are troubled for him ; I will surely haue mercy vpon him , saith the Lord .
Set thee vp way - markes ; make thee high heaps : set thine heart toward the high way , euen the way which thou wentest : turne againe , O virgine of Israel , turne againe to these thy cities .
¶ How long wilt thou go about , O thou backsliding daughter ? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth : A woman shall compasse a man .

And there shall dwell in Iudah it selfe , and in all the cities thereof together , husbandmen , and they that goe forth with flocks .
For I haue satiated the wearie soule , and I haue replenished euery sorowfull soule .
Upon this I awaked and beheld , and my sleepe was sweete vnto me .
¶ Behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel , and the house of Iudah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
And it shall come to passe , that like as I haue watched ouer them , to plucke vp and to breake downe , and to throw downe , and to destroy , and to afflict : so will I watch ouer them , to build and to plant , saith the Lord .
In those dayes they shall say no more , The fathers haue eaten a sowre grape , and the childrens teeth are set on edge .
But euery one shall die for his owne iniquitie , euery man that eateth the sowre grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
¶ Behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that I will make a newe couenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Iudah .
Not according to the couenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I tooke them by the hand , to bring them out of the land of Egypt , which my couenant they brake , although I was an husband vnto them , saith the Lord .
But this shall be the couenant , that I will make with the house of Israel , After those dayes , saith the Lord , I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts , and wil be their God , and they shall be my people .
And they shall teach no more euery man his neighbour , and euery man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for they shall all know mee , from the least of them vnto the greatest of them , saith the Lord ; for I will forgiue their iniquitie , and I will remember their sinne no more .
¶ Thus saith the Lord which giueth the Sunne for a light by day , and the ordinances of the moone and of the starres for a light by night , which diuideth the sea when the waues thereof roare , the Lord of hosts is his name .
If those ordinances depart from before me , saith the Lord , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for euer .
Thus saith the Lord , If heauen aboue can bee measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they haue done , saith the Lord .
¶ Behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that the citie shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel vnto the gate of the corner .
And the measuring line shall yet goe forth ouer against it , vpon the hill Gareb , and shall compasse about to Goath .

The worde that came to Ieremiah from the Lord in the tenth yeere of Zedekiah king of Iudah , which was the eighteenth yeere of Nebuchad - rezzar .
For then the king of Babylons armie besieged Ierusalem : and Ieremiah the prophet was shut vp in the court of the prison which was in the king of Iudahs house .
For Zedekiah king of Iudah had shut him vp , saying , Wherefore doest thou prophecie and say , Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will giue this citie into the hand of the king of Babylon , and hee shall take it ?
And Zedekiah king of Iudah , shal not escape out of the hand of the Caldeans , but shall surely be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shal speake with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes .
And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there shall he be vntill I visit him , saith the Lord : though ye fight with the Caldeans , yee shall not prosper .
¶ And Ieremiah said ; The word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
Behold , Hanameel the sonne of Shallum thine vncle , shall come vnto thee , saying ; Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth : for the right of redemption is thine to buy it .
So Hanameel mine vncles sonne came to me in the court of the prison , according to the word of the Lord , and said vnto me ; Buy my field , I pray thee , that is in Anathoth , which is in the countrey of Beniamin : for the right of inheritance is thine , and the redemption is thine , buy it for thy selfe . Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord . And I bought the field of Hanameel my vncles sonne , that was in Anathoth , and weighed him the money , euen seuenteene shekels of siluer .
And I subscribed the euidence , and sealed it , and tooke witnesses , and weighed him the money in the ballances .
So I tooke the euidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custome , and that which was open .
And I gaue the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah , the sonne of Maaseiah , in the sight of Hanameel mine vncles sonne , and in the presence of the witnesses , that subscribed the booke of the purchase , before all the Iewes that sate in the court of the prison .
¶ And I charged Baruch before them , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel ; Take these euidences , this euidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this euidence which is open , and put them in an earthen vessell , that they may continue many daies .
For thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel ; Houses and fields , and Uineyards shalbe possessed againe in this land .
¶ Now when I had deliuered the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah , I prayed vnto the Lord , saying ,
Ah Lord God , beholde , thou hast made the heauen and the earth by thy great power & stretched out arme , and there is nothing too hard for thee .
Thou shewest louing kindnesse vnto thousands , and recompensest the iniquitie of the fathers into the bosome of their children after them : the great , the mightie God , the Lord of hosts is his Name ,
Great in counsell , and mightie in worke , ( for thine eyes are open vpon all the wayes of the sonnes of men , to giue euery one according to his wayes , and according to the fruit of his doings )
Which hast set signes and wonders in the land of Egypt , euen vnto this day , and in Israel , and amongst other men , and hast made thee a Name , as at this day ,
And hast brought foorth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt , with signes and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arme , and with great terrour ,
And hast giuen them this land which thou didst sweare to their fathers to giue them a land flowing with milke and honie .
And they came in and possessed it , but they obeied not thy voice , neither walked in thy Law , they haue done nothing of all that thou commaundedst them to doe : therefore thou hast caused all this euill to come vpon them .
Beholde the mounts , they are come vnto the citie to take it , and the citie is giuen into the hand of the Caldeans that fight against it , because of the sword , and of the famine , and of the pestilence , and what thou hast spoken is come to passe , and behold , thou seest it .
And thou hast said vnto mee , O Lord God , buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses : for the citie is giuen into the hand of the Caldeans .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah , saying ,
Behold , I am the Lord , the God of all flesh : Is there any thing too hard for me ?
Therfore thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will giue this citie into the hand of the Caldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
And the Caldeans that fight against this citie , shall come and set fire on this citie , and burne it with the houses vpon whose roofes they haue offered incense vnto Baal , and powred out drinke offerings vnto other Gods to prouoke me to anger .
For the children of Israel , and the children of Iudah , haue onely done euill before me from their youth : for the children of Israel haue onely prouoked mee to anger with the worke of their hands , sayth the Lord .
For this citie hath beene to me , as a prouocation of mine anger , and of my furie , from the day that they built it , euen vnto this day ; that I should remooue it from before my face :
Because of all the euill of the children of Israel , and of the children of Iudah , which they haue done to prouoke mee to anger , they , their kings , their Princes , their Priestes , and their Prophets , and the men of Iudah , and the inhabitants of Ierusalem .
And they haue turned vnto mee the backe , and not the face , though I taught them rising vp early , and teaching them , yet they haue not hearkened to receiue instruction ,
But they set their abominations in the house ( which is called by my Name ) to defile it .
And they built the high places of Baal , which are in the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , to cause their sonnes and their daughters to passe through the fire vnto Molech , which I commanded them not , neither came it into my minde , that they should doe this abomination , to cause Iudah to sinne .
¶ And now therefore , thus sayth the Lord the God of Israel concerning this citie , whereof ye say , It shall be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon , by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence :
Behold , I wil gather them out of all countreys , whither I haue driuen them in mine anger , and in my furie , and in great wrath , and I will bring them againe vnto this place ; and I will cause them to dwell safely .
And they shalbe my people , and I will be their God .
And I will giue them one heart , and one way , that they may feare mee for euer , for the good of them , and of their children after them .
And I will make an euerlasting couenant with them , that I will not turne away from them , to doe them good , but I will put my feare in their hearts , that they shall not depart from mee .
Yea , I will reioyce oner them to doe them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly , with my whole heart , and with my whole soule .
For thus sayth the Lord , Like as I haue brought all this great euill vpon this people , so will I bring vpon them all the good that I haue promised them .
And fields shalbe bought in this land whereof ye say , It is desolate without man or beast , it is giuen into the hand of the Caldeans .

Moreouer , the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah the second time ( while hee was yet shut vp in the court of the prison ) saying ;
Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof , the Lord that formed it , to establish it , the Lord is his Name .
Call vnto me , and I will answere thee , and shew thee great and mightie things , which thou knowest not .
For thus sayth the Lord the God of Israel concerning the houses of this citie , and concerning the houses of the kings of Iudah , which are throwen downe by the mounts , and by the sword .
They come to fight with the Caldeans , but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men , whome I haue slaine in mine anger , and in my fury , and for all whose wickednesse I haue hid my face from this citie .
Behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them , and wil reueale vnto them the abundance of peace , and trueth .
And I will cause the captiuitie of Iudah , and the captiuitie of Israel to returne , and will build them as at the first .
And I will clense them from all their iniquitie , whereby they haue sinned against mee : and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they haue sinned , and whereby they haue transgressed against me .
¶ And it shall be to me a name of ioy , a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth , which shall heare all the good that I doe vnto them : and they shall feare and tremble for all the goodnesse , and for all the prosperitie that I procure vnto it .
Thus saith the Lord ; Againe there shall be heard in this place ( which yee say shalbe desolate without man and without beast , euen in the cities of Iudah , and in the streetes of Ierusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant , & without beast . )
The voyce of ioy and the voyce of gladnesse , the voyce of the bridegroome , and the voyce of the bride , the voyce of them that shall say ; Praise the Lord of hostes , for the Lord is good , for his mercy endureth for euer , and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord ; for I will cause to returne the captiuitie of the land , as at the first , saith the Lord .
Thus saith the Lord of hostes ; Againe in this place which is desolate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof shalbe a habitation of shepheards causing their flockes to lie downe .
In the cities of the mountaines , in the cities of the vale , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Beniamin , and in the places about Ierusalem , and in the cities of Iudah , shall the flockes passe againe vnder the hands of him that telleth them , saith the Lord .
Behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that I will performe that good thing which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel , and to the house of Iudah .
¶ In those dayes , and at that time will I cause the branch of righteousnesse to grow vp vnto Dauid , and he shall execute iudgement and righteousnesse in the land .
In those dayes shall Iudah be saued , and Ierusalem shall dwell safely , and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The Lord our righteousnesse .
¶ For thus saith the Lord ; Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne of the house of Israel .
Neither shall the priests the Leuites want a man before me to offer burnt offrings , and to kindle meate offrings , and to doe sacrifice continually .
¶ And the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord ; If you can breake my couenant of the day , and my couenant of the night , and that there should not be day , and night in their season :
Then may also my couenant bee broken with Dauid my seruant , that he should not haue a sonne to reigne vpon his throne ; and with the Leuites the priests my ministers .
As the hoste of heauen cannot be numbred , neither the sand of the sea measured : so will I multiply the seede of Dauid my seruant , and the Leuites that minister vnto me .
Moreouer , the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah , saying ;
Considerest thou not what this people haue spoken , saying ; The two families , which the Lord hath chosen , he hath euen cast them off ? thus they haue dispised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
Thus saith the Lord ; If my couenant be not with day and night , and if I haue not appointed the ordinances of heauen and earth :

The word which came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord ( when Nebuchad - nezzar king of Babylon and all his armie , and all the kingdomes of the earth of his dominion , and all the people fought against Ierusalem and against all the cities thereof ) saying ,
Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , Go , and speake to Zedekiah king of Iudah , and tell him , Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will giue this citie into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shal burne it with fire .
And thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken , and deliuered into his hand , and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speake with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt goe to Babylon .
Yet heare the word of the Lord , O Zedekiah king of Iudah : Thus saith the Lord of thee , Thou shalt not die by the sword :
But thou shalt die in peace , and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee , so shall they burne odours for thee , and they will lament thee , saying , Ah Lord ; for I haue pronounced the word , saith the Lord .
Then Ieremiah the Prophet spake all these words vnto Zedekiah king of Iudah in Ierusalem ;
When the king of Babylons armie fought against Ierusalem , and against all the cities of Iudah that were left , against Lachish , and against Azekah : for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Iudah .
¶ This is the word that came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord , after that the king Zedekiah had made a couenant with all the people which were at Ierusalem to proclaime liberty vnto them , That euery man should let his man seruant , and euery man his maide seruant , being an Hebrewe , or an Hebrewesse , goe free , that none should serue himselfe of them , to wit , of a Iew his brother .
Now when all the princes and all the people which had entred into the couenant , heard that euery one should let his man seruant , and euery one his maid seruant goe free , that none should serue themselues of them any more , then they obeyed and let them goe .
But afterwards they turned , and caused the seruants and the handmaids whom they had let goe free , to returne , and brought them into subiection for seruants and for handmaids .
¶ Therefore the worde of the Lord came to Ieremiah , from the Lord , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel , I made a couenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
At the end of seuen yeeres , let ye go euery man his brother an Hebrew which hath bene sold vnto thee : and when he hath serued thee sixe yeeres , thou shalt let him goe free from thee , but your fathers hearkened not vnto me , neither inclined their eare .
And ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming libertie euery man to his neighbour , and ye had made a couenant before me in the house , which is called by my Name .
But yee turned and polluted my Name , and caused euery man his seruant , and euery man his handmaide , whome yee had set at libertie at their pleasure , to returne ; and brought them into subiection , to bee vnto you for seruants and for handmaids .
Therfore thus saith the Lord , Ye haue not hearkened vnto me , in proclaiming libertie euery one to his brother , and euery man to his neighbour : behold , I proclaime a libertie for you , saith the Lord , to the sword , to the pestilence , and to the famine , and I wil make you to be remoued into all the kingdomes of the earth .
And I wil giue the men that haue transgressed my couenant , which haue not performed the wordes of the couenant which they had made before mee , when they cut the calfe in twaine , and passed betweene the parts thereof ,
The princes of Iudah and the princes of Ierusalem , the eunuches , and the priests , and all the people of the land which passed betweene the parts of the calfe ,
I will euen giue them into the hande of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seeke their life , and their dead bodies shall bee for meate vnto the foules of the heauen , and to the beasts of the earth .
And Zedekiah king of Iudah , and his Princes will I giue into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seeke their life and into the hand of the king of Babylons armie , which are gone vp from you .

The word which came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord , in the daies of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah King of Iudah , saying ,
Goe vnto the house of the Rechabites , and speake vnto them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the chambers , and giue them wine to drinke .
Then I tooke Iaazaniah the sonne of Ieremiah the sonne of Habazimah and his brethren , and all his sonnes , and the whole house of the Rechabites .
And I brought them into the house of the Lord , into the chamber of the sonnes of Hanan , the sonne of Igdaliah a man of God , which was by the chamber of the Princes , which was aboue the chamber of Maaseiah , the sonne of Shallum , the keeper of the doore .
And I set before the sonnes of the house of the Rechabites , pottes , full of wine , and cups , and I said vnto them , Drinke ye wine .
But they said , We will drinke no wine : for Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father , commanded vs , saying ; Ye shall drinke no wine , neither ye , nor your sonnes for euer .
Neither shall ye build house , nor sow seed , nor plant Uineyard , nor haue any : but all your dayes ye shall dwell in tents , that ye may liue many dayes in the land where ye be strangers .
Thus haue we obeyed the voice of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father , in all that he hath charged vs , to drinke no wine all our dayes , we , our wiues , our sonnes , nor our daughters :
Nor to build houses for vs to dwel in , neither haue we Uineyard , nor field , nor seed .
But wee haue dwelt in tents , and haue obeyed , and done according to all that Ionadab our father commanded vs .
But it came to passe when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came vp into the land , that we said , Come , and let vs goe to Ierusalem for feare of the armie of the Caldeans , and for feare of the armie of the Syrians : so we dwell at Ierusalem .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , Goe and tel the men of Iudah , and inhabitants of Ierusalem , Will yee not receiue instruction to hearken to my words , saith the Lord ?
The wordes of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab , that hee commanded his sonnes , not to drinke wine , are performed ; for vnto this day they drinke none , but obey their fathers commandement : notwithstanding I haue spoken vnto you , rising early , and speaking , but ye hearkened not vnto me .
I haue sent also vnto you all my seruants the Prophets , rising vp early and sending them , saying , Returne ye now euery man from his euil way , and amend your doings , and goe not after other gods to serue them , and ye shall dwell in the land , which I haue giuen to you , and to your fathers : but yee haue not enclined your eare , nor hearkned vnto me .
Because the sonnes of Ionadab , the sonne of Rechab , haue performed the commaundement of their father , which he commaunded them , but this people hath not hearkened vnto me ;
Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hostes , the God of Israel , Behold , I will bring vpon Iudah , and vpon all the inhabitants of Ierusalem , all the euill that I haue pronounced against them : because I haue spoken vnto them , but they haue not heard , and I haue called vnto them , but they haue not answered .
¶ And Ieremiah sayd vnto the house of the Rechabites , Thus sayth the Lord of hosts the God of Israel , Because ye haue obeyed the commandement of Ionadab your father , and kept all his precepts , and done according vnto all that he hath commanded you :

And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah , that this word came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord , saying ;
Take thee a roule of a booke , and write therein all the words that I haue spoken vnto thee against Israel , and against Iudah , & against all the nations , from the day I spake vnto thee , from the dayes of Iosiah , euen vnto this day .
It may be that the house of Iudah will heare all the euil which I purpose to doe vnto them ; that they may returne euery man from his euill way , that I may forgiue their iniquitie , and their sinne .
Then Ieremiah called Baruch the sonne of Neriah , and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Ieremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken vnto him , vpon a roule of a booke .
And Ieremiah commanded Baruch , saying , I am shut vp , I cannot goe into the house of the Lord .
Therefore goe thou and reade in the roule , which thou hast written from my mouth , the wordes of the Lord in the eares of the people in the Lords house vpon the fasting day : and also thou shalt reade them in the eares of all Iudah , that come out of their cities .
It may bee they will present their supplication before the Lord , and will returne euery one from his euill way ; for great is the anger and the furie that the Lord hath pronounced against this people .
And Baruch the sonne of Neriah did according to all that Ieremiah the Prophet commanded him , reading in the booke the wordes of the Lord , in the Lords house .
And it came to passe in the fifth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah , in the ninth moneth , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Ierusalem , & to all the people that came from the cities of Iudah vnto Ierusalem .
Then read Baruch in the booke , the wordes of Ieremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court at the entry of the newe gate of the Lords house , in the eares of all the people .
¶ When Michaiah the sonne of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan had heard out of the booke , all the words of the Lord ;
Then hee went downe into the kings house into the scribes chamber , and loe , all the princes sate there , euen Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the sonne of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the sonne of Achbor , and Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the sonne of Hananiah , and all the princes .
Then Michaiah declared vnto them all the words that hee had heard when Baruch read the booke in the eares of the people .
Therefore all the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nethaniah , the sonne of Shelemiah , the sonne of Cushi , vnto Baruch , saying ; Take in thine hand the roule wherein thou hast read in the eares of the people , and come . So Baruch the sonne of Neriah took the roule in his hand , and came vnto them .
And they sayde vnto him , Sit downe now and read it in our eares . So Baruch read it in their eares . Now it came to passe when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one and other , and sayd vnto Baruch , Wee will surely tell the King of all these words .
And they asked Baruch , saying , Tell vs now , How diddest thou write all these words at his mouth ?
Then Baruch answered them , Hee pronounced all these words vnto me with his mouth , and I wrote them with inke in the Booke .
Then said the Princes vnto Baruch , Go hide thee , thou and Ieremiah , and let no man know where yee bee .
¶ And they went in to the King into the Court , bnt they layed vp the roule in the chamber of Elishama the Scribe , and told all the words in the eares of the king .
So the king sent Iehudi to fet the roule , and hee tooke it out of Elishama the scribes chamber , and Iehudi read it in the eares of the king , and in the eares of all the princes which stood beside the king .
Now the king sate in the winter house , in the ninth moneth , & there was a fire on the hearth burning before him .
And it came to passe that when Iehudi had read three or foure leaues , he cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , vntill all the roule was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
Yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his seruants that heard all these words .
Neuerthelesse Elnathan , and Delaiah & Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burne the roule , but he would not heare them .
But the king commaunded Ierahmeel the sonne of Hammelech , and Seraiah the sonne of Azriel , & Shelennah the sonne of Abdiel , to take Baruch the scribe , and Ieremiah the Prophet : but the Lord hid them .
¶ Then the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah ( after that the king had burnt the roule and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremiah ) saying ;
Take thee againe another roule , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roule , which Iehoiakim the king of Iudah hath burnt .
And thou shalt say to Iehoiakim king of Iudah , Thus sayth the Lord , Thou hast burnt this roule , saying , Why hast thou written therein , saying , The king of Babylon shall certainely come and destroy this land , and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast ?
Therefore thus saith the Lord of Iehoiakim king of Iudah ; He shall haue none to sit vpon the throne of Dauid , and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heate , and in the night to the frost .
And I will punish him and his seede , and his seruants for their iniquitie , and I will bring vpon them , and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem , and vpon the men of Iudah all the euill that I haue pronounced against them : but they hearkened not .

And king Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah reigned in stead of Coniah the son of Iehoiakim , whom Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Iudah .
But neither he , nor his seruants , nor the people of the land , did hearken vnto the words of the Lord , which he spake by the prophet Ieremiah .
And Zedekiah the king sent Iehucal the sonne of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Ieremiah , saying , Pray now vnto the Lord our God for vs .
Nowe Ieremiah came in and went out among the people : for they had not put him into prison .
Then Pharaohs armie was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Caldeans that besieged Ierusalem , heard tidings of them , they departed from Ierusalem .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord vnto the Prophet Ieremiah , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , Thus shall ye say to the king of Iudah , that sent you vnto me to enquire of me , Behold , Pharaohs armie which is come forth to helpe you , shall returne to Egypt into their owne land .
And the Caldeans shall come againe , and fight against this citie and take it , and burne it with fire .
Thus saith the Lord , Deceiue not your selues , saying , The Caldeans shall surely depart from vs : for they shall not depart .
For though yee had smitten the whole armie of the Caldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise vp euery man in his tent , and burne this citie with fire .
¶ And it came to passe that when the armie of the Caldeans was broken vp from Ierusalem for feare of Pharaohs armie ,
Then Ieremiah went forth out of Ierusalem to goe into the lande of Beniamin , to separate himselfe thence in the mids of the people .
And when he was in the gate of Beniamin , a captaine of the warde was there , whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the sonne of Hananiah , & he tooke Ieremiah the Prophet , saying , Thou fallest away to the Caldeans
Then said Ieremiah , It is false , I fall not away to the Caldeans : but he hearkened not to him : so Irijah tooke Ieremiah , and brought him to the princes .
Wherfore the princes were wroth with Ieremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison , in the house of Ionathan the scribe , for they had made that the prison .
¶ When Ieremiah was entred into the dungeon , and into the cabbins , and Ieremiah had remained there many dayes :
Then Zedekiah the king sent and tooke him out , and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the Lord ? and Ieremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto king Zedekiah , What haue I offended against thee , or against thy seruants , or against this people , that yee haue put me in prison ?
Where are now your prophets , which prophecied vnto you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
Therefore heare now , I pray thee , O my Lord the king ; let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee , that thou cause me not to returne to the house of Ionathan the scribe , lest I die there .

Then Shephatiah the sonne of Mattan , and Gedaliah the sonne of Pashur and Iucal the sonne of Shelemiah , & Pashur the sonne of Malchiah heard the words that Ieremiah had spoken vnto all the people , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord , He that remaineth in this citie , shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , but he that goeth forth to the Caldeans , shall liue : for he shall haue his life for a pray , and shall liue .
Thus saith the Lord , This citie shall surely be giuen into the hand of the king of Babylons armie , which shall take it .
Therefore the princes sayd vnto the king , We beseech thee let this man be put to death : for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of warre that remaine in this citie , and the hands of all the people , in speaking such words vnto them : for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people , but the hurt .
Then Zedekiah the king sayd , Behold , he is in your hand ; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
Then tooke they Ieremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the sonne of Hammelech that was in the court of the prison : and they let downe Ieremiah with cords : and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Ieremiah sunke in the mire .
¶ Now when Ebed - melech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuches which was in the kings house , heard that they had put Ieremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Beniamin )
Ebed - melech went foorth out of the kings house , and spake to the king , saying ,
My lord the king , these men haue done euill in all that they haue done to Ieremiah the Prophet , whom they haue cast into the dungeon , and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is , for there is no more bread in the city .
Then the king commanded Ebed - melech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirtie men with thee , and take vp Ieremiah the Prophet out of the dungeon before he die .
So Ebed - melech tooke the men with him , and went into the house of the king vnder the treasurie , and tooke thence old cast cloutes , and old rotten ragges , and let them downe by cordes into the dungeon to Ieremiah .
And Ebed - melech the Ethiopian said vnto Ieremiah , Put now these old cast cloutes and rotten ragges vnder thine arme - holes , vnder the cordes . And Ieremiah did so .
So they drew vp Ieremiah with cordes , and tooke him vp out of the dungeon , and Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison .
¶ Then Zedekiah the king sent , and tooke Ieremiah the Prophet vnto him into the third entrie that is in the house of the Lord , and the king said vnto Ieremiah , I will aske thee a thing : hide nothing from me .
Then Ieremiah said vnto Zedekiah , If I declare it vnto thee , wilt thou not surely put me to death ? and if I giue thee counsell , wilt thou not hearken vnto me ?
So the king sware secretly vnto Ieremiah , saying , As the Lord liueth that made vs this soule , I wil not put thee to death , neither will I giue thee into the hand of these men that seeke thy life .
Then said Ieremiah vnto Zedekiah , Thus saith the Lord the God of hostes , the God of Israel , If thou wilt assuredly goe foorth vnto the king of Babylons Princes , then thy soule shall liue , and this Citie shall not be burnt with fire , and thou shalt liue , and thine house .
But if thou wilt not goe foorth to the king of Babylons Princes , then shall this City be giuen into the hand of the Caldeans , and they shall burne it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
And Zedekiah the king said vnto Ieremiah , I am afraid of the Iewes that are fallen to the Caldeans , lest they deliuer mee into their hand , and they mocke me .
But Ieremiah said , They shall not deliuer thee : obey , I beseech thee , the voyce of the Lord , which I speake vnto thee : so it shall be well vnto thee , and thy soule shall liue .
But if thou refuse to goe foorth , this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me .
And behold , all the women that are left in the king of Iudahs house , shalbe brought forth to the king of Babylons Princes , and those women shall say , Thy friends haue set thee on , and haue preuailed against thee : thy feet are sunke in the mire , and they are turned away backe .
So they shall bring out all thy wiues , and thy children to the Caldeans , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the King of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this citie to be burnt with fire .
¶ Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah , Let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
But if the Princes heare that I haue talked with thee , and they come vnto thee , and say vnto thee , Declare vnto vs now what thou hast said vnto the king ; hide it not from vs , and wee wil not put thee to death ; also what the king said vnto thee :
Then thou shalt say vnto them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to returne to Ionathans house to die there .
In the ninth yeere of Zedekiah king of Iudah , in the tenth moneth , came Nebuchad rezzar king of Babylon , and all his armie against Ierusalem , and they besieged it .
And in the eleuenth yeere of Zedekiah , in the fourth moneth , the ninth day of the moneth , the citie was broken vp .
And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in , and sate in the middle gate , euen Nergal - Sharezer , Samgar - Nebo , Sarsechim , Rabsaris , Nergal - Sharezer , Rabmag , with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon .
¶ And it came to passe , that when Zedekiah the king of Iudah saw them and all the men of warre , then they fled and went forth out of the citie by night , by the way of the kings garden , by the gate betwixt the two walles , and hee went out the way of the plaine .
But the Caldeans armie pursued after them , and ouertooke Zedekiah in the plaines of Iericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him vp to Nebuchad - nezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gaue iudgement vpon him .
Then the king of Babylon slewe the sonnes of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Iudah .
Moreouer he put out Zedekiahs eyes , and bound him with chaines , to cary him to Babylon .
¶ And the Caldeans burnt the kings house , and the houses of the people with fire , and brake downe the wals of Ierusalem .
Then Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard caried away captiue into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the citie , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
But Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard left of the poore of the people which had nothing , in the land of Iudah , and gaue them vineyards and fieldes at the same time .
¶ Now Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon gaue charge coucerning Ieremiah to Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard , saying ;
Take him , and looke well to him , and doe him no harme , but doe vnto him euen as he shall say vnto thee .
So Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard sent , and Nebushasban , Rabsaris , and Nergal - Sharezer , Rabmag , and all the King of Babylons Princes :
Euen they sent , and tooke Ieremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him vnto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the sonne of Shaphan , that hee should carie him home : so hee dwelt among the people .
¶ Now the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah , while hee was shut vp in the court of the prison , saying ;
Goe and speake to Ebed - melech the Ethiopian , saying , Thus sayth the Lord of hostes the God of Israel , Behold , I will bring my words vpon this citie for euill , and not for good , and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee .
But I will deliuer thee in that day , sayth the Lord , and thou shalt not be giuen into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
<NON-VERSE>
The word which came to Ieremiah from the Lord after that Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had let him goe from Ramath , when hee had taken him being bound in chaines among all that were caried away captiue of Ierusalem and Iudah , which were caried away captiue vnto Babylon .
And the captaine of the gard took Ieremiah , and sayd vnto him , The Lord thy God hath pronounced this euill vpon this place .
Now the Lord hath brought it , and done according as he hath sayd : because yee haue sinned against the Lord , and haue not obeyed his voyce , therefore this thing is come vpon you .
And now behold , I loose thee this day from the chaines which were vpon thine hand : if it seeme good vnto thee to come with me into Babylon , come , and I will looke well vnto thee : but if it seeme ill vnto thee to come with me into Babylon , forbeare : behold , all the land is before thee : whither it seemeth good and conuenient for thee to goe , thither goe .
Now while he was not yet gone backe , he sayd , Goe backe also to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon hath made gouernour ouer all the cities of Iudah , and dwell with him among the people : or goe wheresoeuer it seemeth conuenient vnto thee to goe . So the captaine of the gard gaue him vitailes and a reward , and let him goe .
Then went Ieremiah vnto Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam to Mizpah , and dwelt with him among the people , that were left in the land .
¶ Now when all the captaines of the forces which were in the fields , euen they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam gouernour in the land , and had committed vnto him men , and women and children , and of the poore of the land , of them that were not caried away captiue to Babylon ;
Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , euen Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , and Iohanan , and Ionathan the sonnes of Kareah , and Seraiah the sonne of Tanhumeth , and the sonnes of Ephai the Netophathite , and Iezaniah the sonne of a Maachathite , they and their men .
And Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan , sware vnto them and to their men , saying , Feare not to serue the Caldeans : dwell in the land and serue the king of Babylon , and it shalbe well with you .
As for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah to serue the Caldeans , which will come vnto vs : but yee , gather yee wine , and summer fruits , and oyle , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities , that yee haue taken .
Likewise when all the Iewes that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Iudah , and that he had set ouer them Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan ;
Euen all the Iewes returned out of all places whither they were driuen , and came to the land of Iudah , to Gedaliah vnto Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits , very much .
¶ Moreouer Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the captaines of the forces that were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
And sayd vnto him , Doest thou certainly know , that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah to slay thee ? But Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam beleeued them not .
Then Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly , saying , Let me goe , I pray thee , and I will slay Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , and no man shall know it . Wherefore should he slay thee , that all the Iewes which are gathered vnto thee should be scattered , and the remnant in Iudah perish ?
Then arose Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , and the ten men that were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan with the sword , and slew him , whome the king of Babylon had made gouernour ouer the land .
Ishmael also slew all the Iewes that were with him , euen with Gedaliah at Mizpah , and the Caldeans that were found there , and the men of warre .
And it came to passe the second day after he had slaine Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
That there came certaine from Shechem , from Shiloh , and from Samaria , euen fourescore men , hauing their beards shauen , and their clothes rent , and hauing cut themselues , with offerings and incense in their hand , to bring them to the house of the Lord .
And Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah went foorth from Mizpah to meete them , weeping all along as hee went : and it came to passe as hee met them , he said vnto them , Come to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam .
And it was so when they came into the midst of the citie , that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
But ten men were found among them , that said vnto Ishmael , Slay vs not : for we haue treasures in the field , of wheate , and of barley , and of oyle , and of hony : so he forbare , and slewe them not among their brethren .
Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men ( whom he had slaine because of Gedaliah ) was it , which Asa the king had made , for feare of Baasha king of Israel , and Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slaine .
Then Ishmael caried away captiue all the residue of the people , that were in Mizpah , euen the kings daughters , and al the people that remained in Mizpah , whom Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam , and Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah caried them away captiue , and departed to goe ouer to the Ammonites . ¶ But when Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the captaines of the forces that were with him , heard of all the euill that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah had done ,
Then they tooke all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon . Now it came to passe that when al the people which were with Ishmael , sawe Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the captaines of the forces , that were with him , then they were glad .
So all the people that Ishmael had caried away captiue from Mizpah cast about and returned , and went vnto Iohanan the sonne of Kareah .
But Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah escaped from Iohanan with eight men , and went to the Ammonites .
Then tooke Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the captaines of the forces that were with him , all the remnant of the people whom he had recouered from Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah , from Mizpah ( after that he had slaine Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam , ) euen mighty men of warre , and the women , and the children , and the eunuches whom he had brought againe from Gibeon .
And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to goe to enter into Egypt ,

Then all the captaines of the forces , and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and Iezaniah the sonne of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least euen vnto the greatest , came neere ,
And said vnto Ieremiah the prophet , Let , we beseech thee , our supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for vs vnto the Lord thy God , euen for all this remnant ( for we are left but a few of many , as thine eies do behold vs )
That the Lord thy God may shew vs the way wherein we may walke , and the thing that we may doe .
Then Ieremiah the prophet sayd vnto them , I haue heard you ; behold , I will pray vnto the Lord your God , according to your words , and it shall come to passe that whatsoeuer thing the Lord shall answere you , I will declare it vnto you : I will keepe nothing backe from you .
Then they sayd to Ieremiah , The Lord be a true and faithfull witnesse betweene vs , if we doe not , euen according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to vs .
Whether it be good , or whether it be euill , we will obey the voice of the Lord our God , to whom we send thee , that it may be well with vs , when we obey the voice of the Lord our God .
¶ And it came to passe after tenne dayes , that the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah .
Then called hee Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the captaines of the forces which were with him , and all the people , from the least , euen to the greatest ,
And said vnto them , Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , vnto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him :
If ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you downe , and I will plant you , and not plucke you vp : for I repent mee of the euill , that I haue done vnto you .
Be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom yee are afraid : be not afraid of him , saith the Lord : for I am with you to saue you , and to deliuer you from his hand .
And I will shew mercies vnto you , that he may haue mercy vpon you ; and cause you to returne to your owne land .
¶ But if ye say , We will not dwell in this land , neither obey the voice of the Lord your God ,
Saying , No , but we will goe into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no warre , nor heare the sound of the Trumpet , nor haue hunger of bread , and there will we dwell :
( And now therefore heare the word of the Lord , yee remnant of Iudah , Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel , If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and goe to soiourne there : )
Then it shall come to passe , that the sword which yee feared , shall ouertake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine whereof yee were afraid , shall follow close after you in Egypt , and there ye shall die .
So shall it bee with all the men that set their faces to goe into Egypt to soiourne there , they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remaine or escape from the euil that I will bring vpon them .
For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel , As mine anger and my furie hath bene powred foorth vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem : so shall my furie bee powred foorth vpon you , when yee shall enter into Egypt : and ye shall be an execration , and an astonishment , and a curse , and a reproch , and ye shall see this place no more .
¶ The Lord hath said concerning you , O ye remnant of Iudah , Goe ye not into Egypt : know certainly , that I haue admonished you this day .
For ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me vnto the Lord your God , saying , Pray for vs vnto the Lord our God , and according vnto all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare vnto vs , and we wil doe it .
And now I haue this day declared it to you , but ye haue not obeied the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me vnto you .
Then spake Azariah the sonne of Hoshaiah , and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the proud men , saying vnto Ieremiah , Thou speakest falsly : the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say , Goe not into Egypt , to soiourne there .
But Iohanan the sonne of Kareah , and all the captaines of the forces , tooke all the remnant of Iudah , that were returned from all nations whither they had bene driuen , to dwell in the land of Iudah ,
Euen men , and women , and children , and the kings daughters , and euery person that Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had left with Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam , the sonne of Shaphan , and Ieremiah the Prophet , and Baruch the sonne of Neriah .
So they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord , thus came they euen to Tahpanhes .
¶ Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ;
Take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the bricke kill , which is at the entry of Pharaohs house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Iudah :
And say vnto them , Thus saieth the Lord of hosts the God of Israel ; Beholde , I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my seruant , and will set his throne vpon these stones that I haue hidde , and hee shall spread his royall pauilion ouer them .
And when he commeth , hee shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliuer such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for captiuitie to captiuitie ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword .
And I wil kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt , and hee shall burne them , and carry them away captiues , and hee shall aray himselfe with the land of Egypt , as a shepheard putteth on his garment , and hee shall goe forth from thence in peace .

The word that came to Ieremiah concerning all the Iewes which dwel in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the countrey of Pathros , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Ye haue seene all the euill that I haue brought vpon Ierusalem , and vpon all the cities of Iudah : and behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein ,
Because of their wickednes which they haue committed , to prouoke me to anger , in that they went to burne incense , and to serue other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , you , nor your fathers .
Howbeit I sent vnto you all my seruants the Prophets , rising early and sending them , saying , Oh doe not this abominable thing that I hate .
But they hearkened not , nor enclined their eare to turne from their wickednes , to burne no incense vnto other gods .
Wherefore my furie and mine anger was powred forth , and was kindled in the cities of Iudah , and in the streets of Ierusalem , and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
Therefore now thus saith the Lord the God of hostes , the God of Israel , Wherefore commit ye this great euill against your soules , to cut off from you man and woman , childe and suckling out of Iudah , to leaue you none to remaine .
In that yee prouoke mee vnto wrath with the workes of your hands , burning incense vnto other gods in the land of Egypt whither ye bee gone to dwell , that yee might cut your selues off , and that ye might be a curse , and a reproch among all the nations of the earth ?
Haue ye forgotten the wickednes of your fathers , and the wickednesse of the kings of Iudah , and the wickednes of their wiues , and your owne wickednesse , and the wickednesse of your wiues , which they haue committed in the land of Iudah , and in the streets of Ierusalem ?
They are not humbled euen vnto this day , neither haue they feared , nor walked in my Law , nor in my Statutes that I set before you , and before your fathers .
¶ Therefore thus sayeth the Lord of hostes , the God of Israel , Behold , I will set my face against you for euill , and to cut off all Iudah .
And I will take the remnant of Iudah , that haue set their faces to goe into the land of Egypt to soiourne there , and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt : they shall euen bee consumed by the sword , and by the famine : they shall die , from the least euen vnto the greatest , by the sword and by the famine : and they shalbe an execration and an astonishment , and a curse , and a reproch .
For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I haue punished Ierusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
So that none of the remnant of Iudah which are gone into the land of Egypt to soiourne there , shall escape or remaine , that they should returne into the land of Iudah to the which they haue a desire to returne to dwell there : for none shall returne but such as shall escape .
¶ Then all the men which knew that their wiues had burnt incense vnto other Gods , and all the women that stood by , a great multitude , euen all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Pathros , answered Ieremiah , saying ,
As for the word that thou hast spoken vnto vs in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken vnto thee .
And when we burnt incense to the queene of heauen , and powred out drinke offrings vnto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and powre out drinke offrings vnto her without our men ?
¶ Then Ieremiah sayd vnto all the people , to the men and to the women , and to all the people which had giuen him that answere , saying ;
The incense that yee burnt in the cities of Iudah , and in the streetes of Ierusalem , yee and your fathers , your kings and your princes , and the people of the land , did not the Lord remember them , and came it not into his minde ?
So that the Lord could no longer beare , because of the euill of your doings , and because of the abominations , which yee haue committed : therefore is your land a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse without an inhabitant , as at this day .
Because you haue burnt incense , and because yee haue sinned against the Lord , and haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lord , nor walked in his law , nor in his statutes , nor in his testimonies : therefore this euill is happened vnto you , as at this day .
Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto all the people , and to all the women ; Heare the word of the Lord , all Iudah , that are in the land of Egypt .
Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel , saying : Yee and your wiues haue both spoken with your mouths , and fulfilled with your hand , saying ; We will surely performe our vowes that we haue vowed , to burne incense to the queene of heauen , and to powre out drinke offrings vnto her : yee will surely accomplish your vowes , and surely performe your vowes .
Therefore heare yee the word of the Lord , all Iudah that dwell in the land of Egypt , Behold , I haue sworne by my great Name , saith the Lord , that my Name shal no more be named in the mouth of any man of Iudah , in all the land of Egypt , saying , The Lord God liueth .
Behold , I will watch ouer them for euill , and not for good , and all the men of Iudah that are in the land of Egypt shalbe consumed by the sword , & by the famin , vntil there be an end of them .
Yet a small number that escape the sword , shall returne out of the land of Egypt into the land of Iudah : and all the remnant of Iudah that are gone into the land of Egypt to soiourne there , shall know whose wordes shall stand , mine or theirs .
¶ And this shalbe a signe vnto you , saith the Lord , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may knowe that my words shal surely stand against you for euill .

Order ye the buckler and shield , and draw neere to battell .
Harnesse the horses , and get vp ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets , furbish the speares , and put on the brigandines .
Wherefore haue I seene them dismaid , and turned away backe ? and their mightie ones are beaten downe , & are fled apace , and looke not back : for feare was round about , saith the Lord .
Let not the swift flee away , nor the mightie man escape : they shal stumble and fall toward the North by the riuer Euphrates .
Who is this that commeth vp as a flood , whose waters are moued as the riuers ?
Egypt riseth vp like a flood , and his waters are moued like the riuers , and he saith , I wil goe vp , and will couer the earth , I will destroy the citie and the inhabitants thereof .
Come vp ye horses , and rage yee charets , and let the mightie men come forth , the Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield , and the Lydians that handle and bend the bow .
For this is the day of the Lord God of hostes , a day of vengeance , that he may auenge him of his aduersaries : and the sword shal deuoure , and it shall be satiate , and made drunke with their blood : for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the North countrey by the riuer Euphrates .
Goe vp into Gilead , and take balme , O virgine , the daughter of Egypt : in vaine shalt thou vse many medicines : for thou shalt not be cured .
The nations haue heard of thy shame , and thy crie hath filled the land : for the mightie man hath stumbled against the mightie , and they are fallen both together .

Why are thy valiant men swept away ? they stood not , because the Lord did driue them .
As I liue , saith the King , whose Name is the Lord of hostes , Surely as Tabor is among the mountaines , and as Carmel by the Sea , so shall hee come .
Oh thou daughter dwelling in Egypt , furnish thy selfe to goe into captiuitie : for Noph shalbe waste and desolate without an inhabitant .
Egypt is like a very faire heifer , but destruction commeth : it commeth out of the North .
Also her hired men are in the midst of her , like fatted bullocks , for they also are turned backe , and are fled away together ; they did not stand , because the day of their calamitie was come vpon them , and the time of their visitation . The voice thereof shall goe like a serpent , for they shall march with an armie , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
They shall cut downe her forrest , saith the Lord , though it cannot be searched , because they are more then the grashoppers , and are innumerable .
The daughter of Egypt shalbe confounded , she shalbe deliuered into the hand of the people of the North .
The Lord of hostes the God of Israel saith , Behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings , euen Pharaoh , and all them that trust in him .
And I will deliuer them into the hand of those that seeke their liues , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his seruants , and afterwards it shalbe inhabited , as in the dayes of old , saith the Lord .
¶ But feare not thou , O my seruant Iacob , and be not dismaied , O Israel : for behold , I will saue thee from afarre off , and thy seed from the land of their captiuitie , and Iacob shall returne and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .

Giue wings vnto Moab , that it may flee and get away : for the cities thereof shalbe desolate , without any to dwell therein .
Cursed be he that doeth the worke of the Lord deceitfully , and cursed be he that keepeth backe his sword from blood .
¶ Moab hath bene at ease from his youth , and hee hath setled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessell to vessell , neither hath he gone into captiuitie : therefore his taste remained in him , and his sent is not changed .
Therfore behold , the dayes come , sayth the Lord , that I will send vnto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander , and shall emptie his vessels , and breake their bottles .
And Moab shall bee ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence .
¶ How say yee , We are mightie and strong men for the warre ?
Moab is spoiled and gone vp out of her cities , and his chosen yong men are gone downe to the slaughter , sayth the King , whose Name is the Lord of hostes .
The calamitie of Moab is neere to come , and his affliction hasteth fast .
All yee that are about him bemoane him , and all yee that know his Name , say , How is the strong staffe broken , and the beautifull rod !
Thou daughter that doest inhabit Dibon , come downe from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of Moab shall come vpon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holdes .
O inhabitant of Aroer , stand by the way and espie , aske him that fleeth , and her that escapeth , and say , What is done ?
Moab is confounded , for it is broken downe : howle and cry , tell ye it in Arnon , that Moab is spoiled ,
And iudgement is come vpon the plaine countrey , vpon Holon , and vpon Iahazah , and vpon Mephaath , And vpon Dibon , and vpon Nebo , and vpon Beth - diblathaim ,
And vpon Kiriathaim , and vpon Beth - Gamul , and vpon Beth - meon ,
And vpon Kerioth , and vpon Bozrah , and vpon all the cities of the land of Moab farre or neere .
The horne of Moab is cut off , & his arme is broken , saith the Lord .
¶ Make ye him drunken : for hee magnified himselfe against the Lord : Moab also shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shalbe in derision .
For was not Israel a derision vnto thee ? was hee found among theeues ? for since thou spakest of him , thou skippedst for ioy .
O yee that dwell in Moab , leaue the cities and dwell in the rocke , and be like the doue that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth .
We haue heard the pride of Moab , ( he is exceeding proud ) his loftinesse and his arrogancie , and his pride , and the hautinesse of his heart .
I knowe his wrath , sayeth the Lord , but it shall not be so , his lyes shall not so effect it .
Therefore will I howle for Moab , and I will cry out for all Moab , mine heart shall mourne for the men of Kir - heres .
O vine of Sibmah , I wil weepe for thee , with the weeping of Iazer ; thy plants are gone ouer the sea , they reach euen to the sea of Iazer , the spoiler is fallen vpon thy summer fruits , and vpon thy vintage .
And ioy and gladnesse is taken from the plentifull field , and from the land of Moab , and I haue caused wine to faile from the winepresses , none shall tread with shouting , their showting shall be no showting .
From the cry of Heshbon euen vnto Elealeh , and euen vnto Iahaz haue they vttered their voyce , from Zoar euen vnto Horonaim as an heifer of three yeeres old : for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate .
Moreouer , I will cause to cease in Moab , saith the Lord , him that offereth in the high places , and him that burneth incense to his Gods .
Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir - heres : because the riches that hee hath gotten is perished .
For euery head shall be bald , and euery beard clipt : vpon all the hands shall be cuttings , and vpon the loines sackcloth .
There shall be lamentation generally vpon all the house toppes of Moab , and in the streetes thereof : for I haue broken Moab like a vessell , wherin is no pleasure , saith the Lord .
They shall howle , saying ; How is it broken downe ? how hath Moab turned the backe with shame ? so shall Moab be a derision , and a dismaying to all them about him .
For thus saith the Lord , Behold , hee shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread his wings ouer Maob .
Kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , & the mighty mens hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he hath magnified himselfe against the Lord .
Feare , and the pit , and the snare shall be vpon thee , O inhabitant of Moab , saith the Lord .
Hee that fleeth from the feare shall fall into the pit , and he that getteth vp out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring vpon it , euen vpon Moab , the yeere of their visitation , saith the Lord .
They that fled , stood vnder the shadow of Heshbon , because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the middest of Sihon , and shall deuoure the corner of Moab , and the crowne of the head of the tumultuous ones .
Woe be vnto thee , O Moab , the people of Chemosh perisheth : for thy sonnes are taken captiues , and thy daughters captiues .

Concerning the Ammonites , thus sayth the Lord ; hath Israel no sonnes ? Hath he no heire ? Why then doth their king inherit God , and his people dwell in his cities ?
Therfore behold , the dayes come , saith the Lord , that I will cause an alarme of warre to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites , and it shall be a desolate heape , and her daughters shall be burnt with fire : then shall Israel be heire vnto them that were his heires , saith the Lord .
Howle , O Heshbon , for Ai is spoiled : cry yee daughters of Rabbah , gird yee with sackcloth : lament and runne to and fro by the hedges : for their king shall goe into captiuitie : and his priests and his princes together .
Wherfore gloriest thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , O backsliding daughter ? That trusted in her treasures , saying ; Who shall come vnto mee ?
Behold , I will bring a feare vpon thee , saith the Lord God of hostes , from all those that be about thee , and yee shall be driuen out euery man right forth , and none shal gather vp him that wandereth .
And afterward I will bring againe the captiuitie of the children of Ammon , saith the Lord .
¶ Concerning Edom thus saith the Lord of hosts , Is wisedome no more in Teman ? is counsell perished from the prudent ? is their wisedom vanished ?
Flee ye , turne backe , dwell deepe , O inhabitants of Dedan : for I will bring the calamitie of Esau vpon him , the time that I will visite him .
If grape gatherers come to thee , would they not leaue some gleaning grapes ? If theeues by night , they will destroy till they haue enough .
But I haue made Esau bare , I haue vncouered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himselfe : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren and his neighbours , and he is not .
Leaue thy fatherlesse children , I will preserue them aliue : and let thy widowes trust in me .
For thus saith the Lord , Behold , they whose iudgement was not to drinke of the cup , haue assuredly drunken , and art thou he that shall altogether go vnpunished ? thou shalt not go vnpunished , but thou shalt surely drinke of it .
For I haue sworne by my selfe , saith the Lord , that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproch , a waste , and a curse , and all the cities thereof shall be perpetuall wastes .
I haue heard a rumor from the Lord , & an ambassadour is sent vnto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together & come against her , & rise vp to the battell .
For lo , I wil make thee smal among the heathen , and despised among men .
Thy terriblenesse hath deceiued thee , and the pride of thine heart , O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rocke , that holdest the height of the hill : thogh thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle , I will bring thee downe from thence , saith the Lord .
Also Edom shalbe a desolation : euery one that goeth by it shalbe astonished , and shall hisse at all the plagues thereof ,
As in the ouerthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the Lord : no man shall abide there , neither shall a sonne of man dwell in it .
Behold , he shal come vp like a lyon from the swelling of Iordane against the habitation of the strong : but I wil suddenly make him runne away from her , and who is a chosen man that I may appoynt ouer her ? For who is like mee ? And who will appoint me the time ? Who is that shepheard that will stand before mee ?
Therfore heare the counsell of the Lord , that he hath taken against Edom , & his purposes that hee hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely the least of the flocke shall draw them out : surely hee shall make their habitations desolate with them .
The earth is moued at the noise of their fall : at the crie , the noise thereof was heard in the red Sea .
Behold , he shall come vp and flie as the eagle , and spread his wings ouer Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mightie men of Edom , be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
¶ Concerning Damascus , Hamath is confounded , & Arpad , for they haue heard euil tidings , they are faint hearted , there is sorrow on the sea , it can not be quiet .
Damascus is waxed feeble , and turneth her selfe to flee , and feare hath seised on her : anguish and sorrowes haue taken her as a woman in trauell .
How is the citie of praise not left , the citie of my ioy ?
Therefore her yong men shal fall in her streets , and all the men of warre shall bee cut off in that day , saith the Lord of hosts .
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus , and it shal consume the palaces of Ben - hadad .
¶ Concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon shall smite , Thus saith the Lord : Arise ye , goe vp to Kedar , and spoile the men of the East .
Their tents and their flocks shall they take away : they shal take to themselues their curtaines and all their vessels , and their camels , and they shal crie vnto them , Feare is on euery side .
¶ Flee , get you farre off , dwell deepe , O ye inhabitants of Hazor , saith the Lord : for Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceiued a purpose against you .
Arise , get you vp vnto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without care , saith the Lord , which haue neither gates nor barres , which dwell alone .
And their camels shall be a bootie , and the multitude of their cattell a spoile , and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the vtmost corners , and I will bring their calamitie from all sides thereof , saith the Lord .
And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for euer ; there shall no man abide there , nor any sonne of man dwell in it .
¶ The word of the Lord that came to Ieremiah the Prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reigne of Zedekiah king of Iudah , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Behold , I will breake the bow of Elam , the chiefe of their might .
And vpon Elam will I bring the foure windes from the foure quarters of heauen , and will scatter them towards all those windes , and there shall be no nation , whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
For I will cause Elam to bee dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seeke their life : and I will bring euill vpon them , euen my fierce anger , saith the Lord , and I will send the sword after them , till I haue consumed them .
And I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the Lord .

The word that the Lord spake against Babylon , and against the land of the Caldeans by Ieremiah the Prophet .
Declare yee among the nations , and publish , and set vp a standart , publish and conceale not : say , Babylon is taken , Bel is confounded , Merodach is broken in pieces , her idols are confounded , her Images are broken in pieces .
For out of the North there commeth vp a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remoue , they shall depart both man and beast .
¶ In those daies , and in that time , saith the Lord , the children of Israel shall come , they , and the children of Iudah together , going and weeping : they shall goe , and seeke the Lord their God .
They shall aske the way to Zion with their faces thitherward , saying , Come , and let vs ioyne our selues to the Lord , in a perpetuall Couenant that shall not be forgotten .
My people hath bene lost sheepe : their shepheards haue caused them to goe astray , they haue turned them away on the mountaines : they haue gone from mountaine to hill , they haue forgotten their resting place .
All that found them haue deuoured them , and their aduersaries said , We offend not , because they haue sinned against the Lord , the habitation of iustice , euen the Lord , the hope of their fathers .
Remoue out of the midst of Babylon , and goe foorth out of the land of the Caldeans , and be as the hee goats before the flocks .

And Caldea shall bee a spoile : all that spoile her shall be satisfied , saith the Lord .
Because ye were glad , because yee reioyced , O ye destroyers of mine heritage , because ye are growen fat , as the heifer at grasse , and bellow as bulles :
Your mother shalbe sore confounded , she that bare you shalbe ashamed : beholde , the hindermost of the nations shalbe a wildernes , a dry land , & a desert .
Because of the wrath of the Lord , it shall not be inhabited , but it shalbe wholly desolate : euery one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished , and hisse at all her plagues .
Put your selues in aray against Babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her ; spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against the Lord ,
Shout against her round about : shee hath giuen her hand : her foundations are fallen , her walls are throwen downe : for it is the vengeance of the Lord : take vengeance vpon her ; as she hath done , doe vnto her .
Cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of haruest : for feare of the oppressing sword , they shall turne euery one to his people , and they shall flee euery one to his owne lande .
¶ Israel is a scattered sheepe , the lyons haue driuen him away : first the king of Assyria hath deuoured him , and last this Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones .

And I will bring Israel againe to his habitation , and he shal feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soule shall be satisfied vpon mount Ephraim and Gilead .

Slay all her bullocks : let them goe downe to the slaughter : woe vnto them , for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
The voice of them that flee & escape out of the land of Babylon to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , the vengeance of his Temple .
Call together the archers against Babylon : all yee that bend the bow , campe against it round about ; let none thereof escape : recompense her according to her worke ; according to all that shee hath done vnto her : for shee hath bene proud against the Lord , against the Holy one of Israel .
Therefore shall her yong men fall in the streets , & all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the Lord .
Behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , sayth the Lord God of hostes : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
And the most proude shall stumble and fall , and none shal raise him vp : and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall deuoure all round about him .

A sword is vpon their horses , and vpon their charets , and vpon all the mingled people that are in the middest of her , and they shall become as women : a sword is vpon her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
A drought is vpon her waters , and they shalbe dried vp : for it is the land of grauen images , and they are madde vpon their idoles .

They shall holde the bow and the lance : they are cruell and will not shewe mercy : their voice shall roare like the sea , and they shall ride vpon horses , euery one put in aray like a man to the battell , against thee , O daughter of Babylon .

¶ The word which Ieremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the sonne of Neriah , the sonne of Maaseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Iudah into Babylon , in the fourth yeere of his reigne , and this Seraiah was a quiet prince .
So Ieremiah wrote in a booke all the euill that should come vpon Babylon : euen all these wordes that are written against Babylon .
And Ieremiah said to Seraiah , When thou commest to Babylon , and shalt see , and shalt read all these words ,
Then shalt thou say , O Lord , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remaine in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shalbe desolate for euer .
And it shall bee when thou hast made an end of reading this booke , that thou shalt binde a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of Euphrates .

Zedekiah was one and twentie yeere olde when he began to reigne , and he reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem , and his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Ieremiah of Libnah .
And hee did that which was euill in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Iehoiakim had done .
For through the anger of the Lord it came to passe in Ierusalem and Iudah , till hee had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
¶ And it came to passe in the ninth yere of his reigne , in the tenth moneth , in the tenth day of the moneth , that Nebuchad rezzar king of Babylon came , hee , and all his armie against Ierusalem , and pitched against it , and built fortes against it round about .
So the citie was besieged vnto the eleuenth yeere of king Zedekiah .
And in the fourth moneth , in the ninth day of the moneth , the famine was sore in the citie , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
Then the city was broken vp , and all the men of warre fled , and went foorth out of the citie by night , by the way of the gate between the two wals , which was by the kings garden ( now the Caldeans were by the city round about ) and they went by the way of the plaine .
¶ But the armie of the Caldeans pursued after the king , and ouertooke Zedekiah in the plaines of Iericho , & all his armie was scattered from him .
Then they tooke the king , and caried him vp vnto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath : where he gaue iudgement vpon him .
And the king of Babylon slew the sonnes of Zedekiah before his eyes : he slewe also all the princes of Iudah in Riblah .
Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and the king of Babylon bound him in chaines , and caried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
¶ Now in the fifth moneth , in the tenth day of the moneth ( which was the nineteenth yeere of Nebuchad - rezzar king of Babylon ) came Nebuzaradan captaine of the guard , which serued the king of Babylon , into Ierusalem ;
And burnt the house of the Lord , and the kings house , and all the houses of Ierusalem , and all the houses of the great men burnt he with fire .
And all the armie of the Caldeans that were with the captaine of the guard , brake downe all the walles of Ierusalem round about .
Then Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard , caried away captiue certaine of the poore of the people , and the residue of the people that remained in the citie , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
The two pillars , one Sea , and twelue brasen bulles , that were vnder the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord : the brasse of all these vessels was without weight . And concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteene cubites , and a fillet of twelue cubites did compasse it , and the thickenesse thereof was foure fingers : it was hollow .
And a chapiter of brasse was vpon it , and the height of one chapiter was fiue cubites , with networke and pomegranates vpon the chapiters round about , all of brasse : the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like vnto these .
And there were ninetie and sixe pomegranates on a side , and all the pomegranates vpon the networke were an hundreth round about .
¶ And the captaine of the guard tooke Seraiah the chiefe Priest , and Zephaniah the second Priest , and the three keepers of the doore .
Hee tooke also out of the citie an Eunuch , which had the charge of the men of warre , and seuen men of them that were neere the kings person which were found in the citie , and the principall Scribe of the host , who mustered the people of the land , and threescore men of the people of the land , that were found in the middest of the citie .
So Nebuzar - adan the captaine of the guard tooke them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
And the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah , in the land of Hamath : thus Iudah was caried away captiue out of his owne land . This is the people whom Nebuchad - rezzar caried away captiue in the seuenth yeere , three thousand Iewes and three and twentie .
In the eighteenth yeere of Nebuchad - rezzar hee caried away captiue from Ierusalem eight hundredth , thirtie and two persons .
In the three and twentith yeere of Nebuchad - rezzar , Nebuzar - adan the captaine of the guard , caried away captiue of the Iewes seuen hundreth fortie and fiue persons : all the persons were foure thousand and sixe hundreth .
¶ And it came to passe in the seuen and thirtieth yeere of the captiuitie of Iehoiakin king of Iudah , in the twelfth moneth , in the fiue and twentieth day of the moneth , that Euil - merodach king of Babylon , in the first yeere of his reigne , lifted vp the head of Iehoiakin king of Iudah , and brought him forth out of prison ,
And spake kindly vnto him , and set his throne aboue the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon ,
And changed his prison garments : and hee did continually eate bread before him all the dayes of his life .

There was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Iob , and that man was perfect and vpright , and one that feared God , and eschewed euill .
And there were borne vnto him seuen sonnes , and three daughters .
His substance also was seuen thousand sheepe , and three thousand camels , and fiue hundred yoke of oxen , and fiue hundred shee asses , and a very great houshold ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East .
And his sonnes went and feasted in their houses , euery one his day , and sent and called for their three sisters , to eate and to drinke with them .
And it was so , when the dayes of their feasting were gone about , that Iob sent and sanctified them , and rose vp early in the morning , and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all : For Iob said , It may be that my sonnes haue sinned , and cursed God in their hearts : Thus did Iob continually .
¶ Now there was a day , when the sons of God came to present themselues before the Lord , and Satan came also among them .
And the Lord said vnto Satan , Whence commest thou ? Then Satan answered the Lord , and sayde , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking vp and downe in it .
And the Lord sayd vnto Satan , Hast thou considered my seruant Iob , that there is none like him in the earth ? a perfect and an vpright man , one that feareth God , and escheweth euill ?
Then Satan answered the Lord , and sayd , Doeth Iob feare God for nought ?
Hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on euery side ? thou hast blessed the worke of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
But put foorth thine hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will curse thee to thy face .
And the Lord said vnto Satan , Behold , all that hee hath is in thy power , onely vpon himselfe put not foorth thine hand . So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord .
¶ And there was a day , when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house :
And there came a messenger vnto Iob , and said , The oxen were plowing , and the asses feeding beside them ,
And the Sabeans fell vpon them , and tooke them away : yea they haue slaine the seruants with the edge of the sword , and I onely am escaped alone , to tell thee .
While he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The fire of God is fallen from heauen , and hath burnt vp the sheepe , and the seruants , and consumed them , and I onely am escaped alone , to tell thee .
While he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The Caldeans made out three bands , and fell vpon the camels , and haue caried them away , yea , and slaine the seruants with the edge of the sword , and I onely am escaped alone , to tell thee .
While he was yet speaking , there came also another , & said , Thy sonnes , and thy daughters , were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house .
And beholde , there came a great winde from the wildernes , and smote the foure corners of the house , and it fell vpon the yong men , and they are dead , and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee .
Then Iob arose , and rent his mantle , and shaued his head , and fell downe vpon the ground and worshipped ,
And said , Naked came I out of my mothers wombe , and naked shall I returne thither : the Lord gaue , and the Lord hath taken away , blessed be the Name of the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Againe there was a day when the sonnes of God came to present themselues before the Lord , and Satan came also among them to present himselfe before the Lord .
And the Lord said vnto Satan , From whence commest thou ? And Satan answered the Lord , and said , From going to & fro in the earth , and from walking vp and downe in it .
And the Lord said vnto Satan , Hast thou considered my seruant Iob , that there is none like him in the earth ; a perfect and an vpright man , one that feareth God , and escheweth euill ? and still hee holdeth fast his integritie , although thou moouedst mee against him , to destroy him without cause .
And Satan answered the Lord , and said , Skinne for skinne , yea all that a man hath , wil he giue for his life .
But put foorth thine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
And the Lord said vnto Satan , Behold , hee is in thine hand , but saue his life .
¶ So went Satan foorth from the presence of the Lord , and smote Iob with sore biles , from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne .
And hee tooke him a potsheard to scrape himselfe withall ; and hee sate downe among the ashes .
¶ Then saide his wife vnto him , Doest thou still reteine thine integritie ? Curse God , and die .
But he said vnto her , Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh ; what ? shall wee receiue good at the hand of God , and shall wee not receiue euill ? In all this did not Iob sinne with his lippes .
¶ Now when Iobs three friends heard of all this euill , that was come vpon him , they came euery one from his owne place : Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite ; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourne with him , and to comfort him .
And when they lift vp their eyes afarre off , and knew him not , they lifted vp their voice , and wept ; and they rent euery one his mantle , and sprinckled dust vpon their heades toward heauen .
<NON-VERSE> After this , opened Iob his mouth , and cursed his day .
And Iob spake , and said ,
Let the day perish , wherein I was borne , and the night in which it was said , There is a man - childe conceiued .
Let that day bee darkenesse , let not God regard it from aboue , neither let the light shine vpon it .
Let darkenes and the shadowe of death staine it , let a cloud dwell vpon it , let the blacknes of the day terrifie it .
As for that night , let darkenesse seaze vpon it , let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere , let it not come into the number of the moneths .
Loe , let that night be solitarie , let no ioyfull voice come therein .
Let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to raise vp their mourning .
Let the starres of the twilight thereof be darke , let it looke for light , but haue none , neither let it see the dawning of the day :
Because it shut not vp the doores of my mothers wombe , nor hid sorrowe from mine eyes .
Why died I not from the wombe ? why did I not giue vp the ghost when I came out of the bellie ?
Why did the knees preuent mee ? or why the breasts , that I should sucke ?
For now should I haue lien still and beene quiet , I should haue slept ; then had I bene at rest ,
With Kings and counsellers of the earth , which built desolate places for themselues ,
Or with Princes that had golde , who filled their houses with siluer :
Or as an hidden vntimely birth , I had not bene ; as infants which neuer saw light .
There the wicked cease from troubling : and there the wearie be at rest .
There the prisoners rest together , they heare not the voice of the oppressour .
Which long for death , but it commeth not , and dig for it more then for hid treasures :
Which reioice exceedingly , and are glad when they can finde the graue ?
Why is light giuen to a man , whose way is hid , and whom God hath hedged in ?
For my sighing commeth before I eate , and my roarings are powred out like the waters .
For the thing which I greatly feared is come vpon me , and that which I was afraid of , is come vnto me .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered , and said ,
Thy words haue vpholden him that was falling , and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees .
But now it is come vpon thee , and thou faintest , it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
Is not this thy feare , thy confidence ; the vprightnesse of thy wayes and thy hope ?
Remember , I pray thee , who euer perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ?
Euen as I haue seene , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickednsse , reape the same .
By the blast of God they perish , and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed . The roaring of the Lyon , and the voice of the fierce Lyon , and the teeth of the yong Lyons are broken .
The old Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray , and the stout Lyons whelpes are scattered abroad .
Nowe a thing was secretly brought to me , and mine eare receiued a litle thereof .
In thoughts from the visions of the night , when deepe sleepe falleth on men :
Feare came vpon me , and trembling , which made all my bones to shake .
Then a spirit passed before my face : the haire of my flesh stood vp .
It stood still , but I could not discerne the forme thereof : an image was before mine eyes , there was silence , and I heard a voyce , saying ,
Shall mortall man be more iust then God ? shall a man bee more pure then his maker ?
Behold , hee put no trust in his seruants ; and his Angels hee charged with folly :
Howe much lesse on them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth .
They are destroyed from morning to euening : they perish for euer , without any regarding it .
<NON-VERSE>
Call now , if there be any that wil answere thee , and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne ?
For wrath killeth the foolish man , and enuy slayeth the silly one .
I haue seene the foolish taking roote : but suddenly I cursed his habitation .
His children are farre from safetie , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliuer them .
Whose haruest the hungry eateth vp , and taketh it euen out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth vp their substance .
Although affliction commeth not forth of the dust , neither doeth trouble spring out of the ground :
Yet man is borne vnto trouble , as the sparkes flie vpward .
I would seeke vnto God , and vnto God would I commit my cause :
He taketh the wise in their owne craftinesse : and the counsell of the froward is caried headlong .
They meete with darkenesse in the day time , and grope in the noone day as in the night .
But he saueth the poore from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mightie .
So the poore hath hope , and iniquitie stoppeth her mouth .
Behold , happy is the man whom God correcteth : therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almightie .
For he maketh sore , and bindeth vp : he woundeth , and his hands make whole .
Hee shall deliuer thee in sixe troubles , yea in seuen there shall no euill touch thee .
In famine he shall redeeme thee from death : and in warre from the power of the sword .
Thou shalt be hidde from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction , when it commeth .
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth .
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall bee in peace ; and thou shalt visite thy habitation , and shalt not sinne .
Thou shalt know also that thy seede shalbe great , and thine offspring as the grasse of the earth .
Thou shalt come to thy graue in a full age , like as a shocke of corne commeth in , in his season .
<NON-VERSE> But Iob answered , and sayd ,
Oh that my griefe were throughly weighed , and my calamitie layd in the balances together .
For now it would be heauier then the sand of the sea , therefore my words are swallowed vp .
For the arrowes of the Almightie are within me , the poyson whereof drinketh vp my spirit : the terrors of God doe set themselues in aray against mee .
Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse ? or loweth the oxe ouer his fodder ?
Can that which is vnsauery , bee eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egge ?
Euen that it would please God to destroy mee , that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off .
Then should I yet haue comfort , yea I would harden my selfe in sorrow ; let him not spare , for I haue not concealed the words of the holy One .
Is not my helpe in me ? and is wisedome driuen quite from me ?
The troupes of Tema looked , the companies of Sheba waited for them .
They were confounded because they had hoped ; they came thither , and were ashamed .
For now ye are nothing ; ye see my casting downe , and are afraid .
Did I say , Bring vnto mee ? or giue a reward for me of your substance ?
Or deliuer me from the enemies hand , or redeeme me from the hand of the mighty ?
Teach me , and I will hold my tongue : and cause mee to vnderstand wherein I haue erred .
How forcible are right wordes ? but what doeth your arguing reproue ?
Do ye imagine to reproue words , and the speeches of one that is desperate , which are as winde ?
Yea , ye ouerwhelme the fatherlesse , and you digge a pit for your friend .
Now therefore be content , looke vpon mee , for it is euident vnto you , if I lie .
Returne , I pray you , let it not be iniquitie ; yea returne againe : my righteousnesse is in it .
<NON-VERSE>
Is there not an appointed time to man vpon earth ? are not his dayes also like the dayes of an hireling ?
As a seruant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his worke :
So am I made to possesse moneths of vanitie , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
When I lie downe , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossings to and fro , vnto the dawning of the day .
My flesh is cloathed with wormes and clods of dust , my skinne is broken , and become loathsome .
My dayes are swifter then a weauers shuttle , and are spent without hope .
O remember that my life is winde : mine eye shall no more see good .
The eye of him that hath seene me , shall see mee no more : thine eyes are vpon me , and I am not .
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away : so he that goeth downe to the graue , shall come vp no more .
Hee shall returne no more to his house : neither shall his place know him any more .
Therefore I will not refraine my mouth , I wil speake in the anguish of my spirit , I will complaine in the bitternesse of my soule .
Am I a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch ouer me ?
When I say , My bed shal comfort me , my couch shall ease my complaint :
I loath it , I would not liue alway : let me alone , for my dayes are vanitie .
What is man , that thou shouldest magnifie him ? and that thou shouldest set thine heart vpon him ?
And that thou shouldest visite him euery morning , and trie him euery moment ?
How long wilt thou not depart from me ? nor let me alone till I swallow downe my spittle ?
I haue sinned , what shall I doe vnto thee , O thou preseruer of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to my selfe ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite , and said ,
How long wilt thou speake these things ? and how long shall the wordes of thy mouth be like a strong wind ?
Doth God peruert iudgement ? or doth the Almightie peruert iustice ?
If thy children haue sinned against him , and he haue cast them away for their transgression :
If thou wouldest seeke vnto God betimes , and make thy supplication to the Almightie :
If thou wert pure and vpright , surely now he would awake for thee , and make the habitation of thy righteousnes prosperous .
Though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
For enquire , I pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thy selfe to the search of their fathers .
( For we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our dayes vpon earth are a shadow . )
Shall not they teach thee , and tell thee , & vtter words out of their heart ?
Can the rush growe vp without myre ? can the flag growe without water ?
Whilest it is yet in his greennesse , and not cut downe , it withereth before any other herbe .
So are the paths of all that forget God , and the hypocrites hope shall perish :
Whose hope shall be cut off , and whose trust shall be a spiders web .
He shall leane vpon his house , but it shall not stand : he shal hold it fast , but it shall not endure .
He is greene before the sunne , and his branch shooteth forth in his garden .
His roots are wrapped about the heape , and seeth the place of stones .
If he destroy him from his place , then it shal denie him , saying , I haue not seene thee .
Beholde , this is the ioy of his way , and out of the earth shall others grow .
Behold , God will not cast away a perfect man , neither will hee helpe the euill doers :
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing , and thy lips with reioycing .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Iob answered , and said ,
I know it is so of a trueth : but howe should man be iust with God .
If he will contend with him , he cannot answere him one of a thousand .
He is wise in heart , and mightie in strength : who hath hardened himselfe against him , and hath prospered ?
Which remoueth the mountains , and they know not : which ouerturneth them in his anger :
Which shaketh the earth out of her place , & the pillars thereof tremble :
Which commandeth the Sunne , and it riseth not : and sealeth vp the starres .
Which alone spreadeth out the heauens , and treadeth vpon the waues of the Sea .
Which maketh Arcturus , Orion and Pleiades , and the chambers of the South .
Which doeth great things past finding out , yea and wonders without number .
Loe , hee goeth by me , and I see him not : he passeth on also , but I perceiue him not .
Behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ? who will say vnto him , What doest thou ?
If God will not withdraw his anger , the proud helpers doe stoupe vnder him .
How much lesse shall I answere him , and choose out my words to reason with him ?
Whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not answere , but I would make supplication to my Iudge .
If I had called , and had answered me , yet would I not beleeue that he had hearkened vnto my voice :
For he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
Hee will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with bitternesse .
If I speake of strength , loe , hee is strong : and if of iudgement , who shall set me a time to pleade ?
If I iustifie my selfe , mine owne mouth shall condemne me : If I say , I am perfect , it shall also prooue me peruerse .
Though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soule : I would despise my life .
This is one thing , therefore I said it ; he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked .
If the scourge slay suddenly , hee will laugh at the triall of the innocent .
The earth is giuen into the hand of the wicked : he couereth the faces of the Iudges thereof ; if not , where , and who is hee ?
Now my dayes are swifter then a Poste : they flee away , they see no good .
They are passed away as the ships : as the Eagle that hasteth to the pray .
If I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leaue off my heauinesse , and comfort my selfe .
I am afraid of all my sorrowes , I know that thou wilt not holde me innocent .
If I be wicked , why then labour I in vaine ?
If I wash my selfe with snow water , and make my handes neuer so cleane :
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine owne clothes shall abhorre me .
For he is not a man as I am , that I should answere him , and we should come together in iudgement .
Neither is there any dayes - man betwixt vs , that might lay his hand vpon vs both .
Let him take his rodde away from me , & let not his feare terrifie me :
<NON-VERSE>
My soule is weary of my life , I will leaue my complaint vpon my selfe ; I will speake in the bitternesse of my soule .
I will say vnto God , Doe not condemne mee ; shewe me wherefore thou contendest with me .
Is it good vnto thee , that thou shouldest oppresse ? that thou shouldest despise the worke of thine hands ? and shine vpon the counsell of the wicked ?
Hast thou eyes of flesh ? or seest thou as man seeth ?
Are thy dayes as the dayes of man ? are thy yeeres as mans dayes ,
That thou enquirest after mine iniquitie , and searchest after my sinne ?
Thou knowest that I am not wicked , and there is none that can deliuer out of thine hand .
Thine hands haue made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou doest destroy me .
Remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay , and wilt thou bring me into dust againe ?
Hast thou not powred me out as milke , and cruddled me like cheese ?
Thou hast cloathed me with skin and flesh , and hast fenced me with bones and sinewes .
Thou hast granted me life and fauour , and thy visitation hath preserued my spirit .
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart ; I know that this is with thee .
If I sinne , then thou markest me , and thou wilt not acquite me from mine iniquitie .
If I be wicked , woe vnto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift vp my head : I am full of confusion , therefore see thou mine affliction :
For it increaseth : thou huntest me as a fierce Lion : and againe thou shewest thy selfe marueilous vpon me .
Thou renuest thy witnesses against me , and increasest thine indignation vpon me ; Changes and warre are against me . Wherfore then hast thou brought me forth out of the wombe ? Oh that I had giuen vp the ghost , and no eye had seene me !
I should haue bene as though I had not bene , I should haue bene caried from the wombe to the graue .
Are not my dayes few ? cease then , and let me alone that I may take comfort a litle , Before I goe whence I shall not returne , euen to the land of darknes and the shadow of death ,
<NON-VERSE>
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite , and said ,
Should not the multitude of words be answered ? and should man ful of talke be iustified ?
Should thy lies make men hold their peace ? and when thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ?
For thou hast said , My doctrine is pure , and I am cleane in thine eyes .
But , O that God would speake , and open his lippes against thee ,
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisedome , that they are double to that which is : know therefore that God exacteth of thee lesse then thine iniquitie deserueth .
Canst thou by searching finde out God ? canst thou finde out the Almightie vnto perfection ?
It is as high as heauen , what canst thou doe ? deeper then hell , what canst thou know ?
The measure therof is longer then the earth , and broader then the sea .
If he cut off , and shut vp , or gather together , then who can hinder him ?
For , he knoweth vaine men : hee seeth wickednesse also , will he not then consider it ?
For vaine man would be wise ; though man be borne like a wilde asses coult .
If thou prepare thine heart , and stretch out thine hands toward him :
If iniquitie be in thine hand , put it farre away , and let not wickednes dwell in thy tabernacles .
For then shalt thou lift vp thy face without spot , yea thou shalt be stedfast , and shalt not feare :
Because thou shalt forget thy misery , and remember it as waters that passe away :
And thine age shalbe clearer then the noone day ; thou shalt shine foorth , thou shalt be as the morning .
And thou shalt be secure because there is hope , yea thou shalt digge about thee , and thou shalt take thy rest in safety .
Also thou shalt lye downe , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea many shall make suite vnto thee .
<NON-VERSE> And Iob answered , and sayd ,
No doubt but ye are the people , and wisedome shall die with you .
But I haue vnderstanding as well as you , I am not inferiour to you : yea , who knoweth not such things as these ? I am as one mocked of his neighbour , who calleth vpon God , and he answereth him : the iust vpright man is laughed to scorne .
He that is ready to slippe with his feet , is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
The tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that prouoke God are secure , into whose hand God bringeth abundantly .
But aske now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the foules of the aire , and they shall tell thee .
Or speake to the earth , and it shall teach thee ; and the fishes of the sea shall declare vnto thee .
Who knoweth not in all these , that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this ?
In whose hand is the soule of euery liuing thing , and the breath of all mankinde .
Doeth not the eare trie wordes ? and the mouth taste his meate ?
With the ancient is wisedome , and in length of dayes , vnderstanding .
With him is wisedome & strength , he hath counsell and vnderstanding .
Behold , he breaketh downe , and it cannot be built againe : hee shutteth vp a man , and there can be no opening .
Behold , hee withholdeth the waters , and they drie vp : also hee sendeth them out , and they ouerturne the earth .
With him is strength & wisedome : the deceiued , and the deceiuer , are his .
He leadeth counsellers away spoiled , and maketh the Iudges fooles .
He looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loines with a girdle . He leadeth Princes away spoiled , and ouerthroweth the mightie .
He remooueth away the speech of the trustie , and taketh away the vnderstanding of the aged .
He powreth contempt vpon princes , and weakeneth the strength of the mightie .
Hee discouereth deepe things out of darkenesse , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death . He increaseth the nations , and destroyeth them : hee inlargeth the nations , and straiteneth them againe .
He taketh away the heart of the chiefe of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wildernes where there is no way .
<NON-VERSE>
Loe , mine eye hath seene all this , mine eare hath heard and vnderstood it .
What yee know , the same doe I know also , I am not inferiour vnto you .
Surely I would speake to the Almighty , & I desire to reason with God .
But ye are forgers of lies , yee are all Physicians of no value .
O that you would altogether hold your peace , & it should be your wisdome .
Heare now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips . Wil you speake wickedly for God ? and talke deceitfully for him ?
Will ye accept his person ? Will yee contend for God ?
Is it good that hee should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another , doe ye so mocke him ?
He will surely reprooue you , if yee doe secretly accept persons .
Shall not his excellencie make you afraid ? and his dread fall vpon you ?
Your remembrances are like vnto ashes , your bodies to bodies of clay .
Hold your peace , let me alone that I may speake , and let come on me what will .
Wherefore doe I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in mine hand ?
Though hee slay mee , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintaine mine owne wayes before him .
Hee also shall be my saluation : for an hypocrite shall not come before him .
Who is hee that will plead with me ? for now if I hold my tongue , I shall giue vp the ghost .
Only doe not two things vnto me : then will I not hide my selfe from thee .
Withdrawe thine hand far from me : and let not thy dread make mee afraid .
Then call thou , and I will answere : or let me speake , and answere thou mee .
How many are mine iniquities and sinnes ? make mee to knowe my transgression , and my sinne .
Wherefore hidest thou thy face , and holdest me for thine enemie ?
Wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro ? and wilt thou pursue the drie stubble ?
For thou writest bitter things against mee , and makest me to possesse the iniquities of my youth .
Thou puttest my feete also in the stockes , and lookest narrowly vnto all my pathes ; thou settest a print vpon the heeles of my feete .
<NON-VERSE>
Man that is borne of a woman , is of few dayes , and full of trouble .
Hee commeth forth like a flower , and is cut downe : he fleeth also , as a shaddow and continueth not .
And doest thou open thine eies vpon such an one , and bringest me into iudgment with thee ?
Who can bring a cleane thing out of an vncleane ? not one .
Seeing his daies are determined , the number of his moneths are with thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot passe .
Turne from him that hee may rest , till he shall accomplish , as an hircling , his day .
For there is hope of a tree , if it be cut downe , that it will sprout againe , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
Though the roote thereof waxe old in the earth , and the stocke thereof die in the ground :
Yet through the sent of water it will bud , and bring forth boughes like a plant .
But man dyeth , and wasteth away ; yea , man giueth vp the ghost , and where is hee ?
As the waters faile from the sea , and the floud decayeth and dryeth vp :
So man lyeth downe , and riseth not , till the heauens be no more , they shall not awake ; nor bee raised out of their sleepe .
O that thou wouldest hide mee in the graue , that thou wouldest keepe me secret , vntill thy wrath bee past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me .
If a man die , shall he liue againe ? All the dayes of my appointed time will I waite , till my change come .
Thou shalt call , and I will answer thee : thou wilt haue a desire to the worke of thine hands .
For nowe thou numbrest my steppes , doest thou not watch ouer my sinne ?
My transgression is sealed vp in a bagge , and thou sowest vp mine iniquitie .
And surely the mountaine falling commeth to nought : and the rocke is remoued out of his place .
The waters weare the stones , thou washest away the things which growe out of the dust of the earth , and thou destroyest the hope of man .
Thou preuailest for euer against him , and hee passeth : thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away .
His sonnes come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought lowe , but he perceiueth it not of them .
<NON-VERSE>
Should hee reason with vnprofitable talke ? or with speeches wherewith he can doe no good ?
Yea thou castest off feare , and restrainest prayer before God .
For thy mouth vttereth thine iniquitie , and thou choosest the tongue of the craftie .
Thine owne mouth condemneth thee , and not I : yea thine owne lippes testifie against thee .
Art thou the first man that was borne ? or wast thou made before the hilles ?
Hast thou heard the secret of God ? and doest thou restraine wisedome to thy selfe ?
What knowest thou that we know not ? what vnderstandest thou , which is not in vs ?
With vs are both the gray headed , and very aged men , much elder then thy father .
Are the consolations of God small with thee ? is there any secret thing with thee ?
Why doeth thine heart carie thee away ? and what doe thine eyes winke at ,
That thou turnest thy spirit against God , and lettest such words goe out of thy mouth ?
What is man , that he should be cleane ? and he which is borne of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
Beholde , he putteth no trust in his Saints , yea , the heauens are not cleane in his sight .
How much more abominable and filthie is man , which drinketh iniquitie like water ?
I will shew thee , heare me , and that which I haue seene , I wil declare ,
Which wise men haue tolde from their fathers , and haue not hid it :
A dreadfull sound is in his eares ; in prosperitie the destroyer shall come vpon him .
He beleeueth not that he shall returne out of darkenesse , and he is waited for , of the sword .
He wandereth abroad for bread , saying , Where is it ? he knoweth that the day of darkenes is ready at his hand .
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall preuaile against him , as a king ready to the battell .
For he stretcheth out his hand against God , and strengtheneth himselfe against the Almightie .
He runneth vpon him , euen on his necke , vpon the thicke bosses of his bucklers :
Because he couereth his face with his fatnesse , and maketh collops of fat on his flankes .
And he dwelleth in desolate cities , and in houses which no man inhabiteth , which are ready to become heapes .
He shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof vpon the earth .
He shall not depart out of darkenesse , the flame shall drie vp his branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he goe away .
Let not him that is deceiued , trust in vanitie : for vanitie shalbe his recompence .
It shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not bee greene .
He shal shake off his vnripe grape as the Uine , and shall cast off his flowre as the Oliue .
I haue heard many such things : miserable comforters are ye all .
Shall vaine words haue an ende ? or what emboldeneth thee , that thou answerest ?
I also could speake as yee doe : if your soule were in my soules stead , I could heape vp words against you , and shake mine head at you .
But I would strengthen you with my mouth , and the mouing of my lips should asswage your griefe .
Though I speake , my griefe is not asswaged : and though I forbeare ; what am I eased ?
But now he hath made me weary : thou hast made desolate al my companie .
And thou hast filled mee with wrinckles , which is a witnesse against me : and my leannesse rising vp in me , beareth witnesse to my face .
He teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth vpon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes vpon me .
They haue gaped vpon me with their mouth , they haue smitten me vpon the cheeke reprochfully , they haue gathered themselues together against mee .
God hath deliuered me to the vngodly , and turned me ouer into the hands of the wicked .
I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken me by my necke , and shaken me to pieces , and set me vp for his marke .
His archers compasse me round about , he cleaueth my reines asunder , and doeth not spare ; he powreth out my gall vpon the ground .
He breaketh me with breach vpon breach , he runneth vpon me like a giant .
I haue sowed sackcloth vpon my skin , and defiled my horne in the dust .
My face is fowle with weeping , and on mine eye - lids is the shadow of death ;
Not for any iniustice in mine hands : also my prayer is pure .
O earth couer not thou my blood , and let my cry haue no place .
O that one might plead for a man with God , as a man pleadeth for his neighbour .
Are there not mockers with mee ? and doeth not mine eye continue in their prouocation ?
Lay downe now , put me in a suretie with thee ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
For thou hast hid their heart from vnderstanding : therefore shalt thou not exalt them .
Hee that speaketh flattery to his friends , euen the eyes of his children shall faile .
He hath made me also a by - word of the people , and afore time I was as a tabret .
Mine eye also is dimme by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
Upright men shall be astonied at this , and the innocent shall stirre vp himselfe against the hypocrite .
The righteous also shall hold on his way , and he that hath cleane hands shalbe stronger , and stronger .
But as for you all , doe you returne , and come now , for I cannot find one wise man among you .
My dayes are past , my purposes are broken off , euen the thoughts of my heart :
They change the night into day : the light is short , because of darknes .
If I waite , the graue is mine house : I haue made my bedde in the darknesse .
I haue said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worme , Thou art my mother , and my sister .
And where is now my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said ,
How long will it bee , ere you make an ende of words ? Marke , and afterwards we will speake .
Wherefore are wee counted as beasts , and reputed vile in your sight ?
He teareth himselfe in his anger : shall the earth be forsaken for thee ? and shall the rocke bee remooued out of his place ?
Yea , the light of the wicked shalbe put out , and the sparke of his fire shall not shine .
The snare is laide for him in the ground , and a trap for him in the way .
It shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his : brimstone shall be scattered vpon his habitation . His rootes shall be dryed vp beneath : and aboue shall his branch be cut off .
His remembrance shall perish from the earth , and hee shall haue no name in the streete .
He shall be driuen from light into darkenesse , and chased out of the world .
Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephew among his people , nor any remaining in his dwellings .
They that come after him shalbe astonied at his day , as they that went before , were affrighted .
How long will yee vexe my soule , and breake me in pieces with words ?
These tenne times haue ye reproched me : you are not ashamed that you make your selues strange to me .
And be it indeed that I haue erred , mine errour remaineth with my selfe .
If indeed yee will magnifie your selues against me , and plead against me my reproch :
Know now that God hath ouerthrowen me , and hath compassed me with his net .
Behold , I cry out of wrong , but I am not heard : I cry aloude , but there is no iudgement .
Hee hath fenced vp my way that I cannot passe ; and hee hath set darkenesse in my pathes .
Hee hath stript me of my glory , and taken the crowne from my head .
He hath destroyed me on euery side , and I am gone : and mine hope hath he remooued like a tree .
He hath also kindled his wrath against me , and hee counteth me vnto him as one of his enemies .
His troupes come together , and raise vp their way against me , and encampe round about my tabernacle .
Hee hath put my brethren farre from me , and mine acquaintance are verely estranged from me .
My kinsefolke haue failed , and my familiar friends haue forgotten me .
They that dwell in mine house , and my maides count me for a stranger : I am an aliant in their sight .
I called my seruant , and he gaue me no answere : I intreated him with my mouth .
My breath is strange to my wife , though I entreated for the childrens sake of mine owne body .
Yea , yong children despised me ; I arose , and they spake against me .
All my inward friends abhorred me : and they whom I loued , are turned against me .
My bone cleaueth to my skinne , and to my flesh , and I am escaped with the skinne of my teeth .
Haue pity vpon me , haue pitie vpon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
Why doe ye persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
Oh that my wordes were now written , oh that they were printed in a booke !
That they were grauen with an iron pen and lead , in the rocke for euer .
For I know that my Redeemer liueth , and that he shall stand at the latter day , vpon the earth :
And though after my skin , wormes destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God :
Whom I shal see for my selfe , and mine eyes shall beholde , and not another , though my reines bee consumed within me .
But ye should say , Why persecute we him ? seeing the root of the matter is found in me .
<NON-VERSE>
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite , and saide ,
Therefore doe my thoughts cause mee to answere , and for this I make haste .
I haue heard the checke of my reproach , and the spirit of my vnderstanding causeth me to answere .
Knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed vpon earth ,
That the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the ioy of the hypocrite but for a moment ?
Though his excellencie mount vp to the heauens , and his head reach vnto the clouds :
Yet he shall perish for euer , like his owne doung : they which haue seene him , shall say , Where is he ?
He shall flie away as a dreame , and shall not be found : yea he shalbe chased away as a vision of the night .
The eye also which saw him , shall see him no more ; neither shall his place any more behold him .
His children shall seeke to please the poore , and his hands shall restore their goods .
Yet his meate in his bowels is turned , it is the gall of Aspes within him .
He hath swallowed downe riches , and hee shall vomite them vp againe : God shall cast them out of his belly .
He shall sucke the poison of Aspes : the vipers tongue shall slay him .
Hee shall not see the riuers , the floods , the brookes of hony and butter .
That which he laboured for , shall he restore , & shall not swallow it downe : according to his substance shall the restitution bee , and hee shall not reioyce therein .
Because hee hath oppressed , and hath forsaken the poore ; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not :
Surely he shall not feele quietnesse in his belly , hee shall not saue of that which he desired .
There shall none of his meat be left , therefore shall no man looke for his goods .
In the fulnesse of his sufficiencie , he shalbe in straites : euery hand of the wicked shall come vpon him .
When he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the furie of his wrath vpon him , and shall raine it vpon him while he is eating .
He shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steele shall strike him through .
It is drawen , and commeth out of the body ; yea the glistering sword commeth out of his gall ; terrours are vpon him .
All darknesse shalbe hid in his secret places : a fire not blowen shall consume him ; it shall goe ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
The heauen shall reueale his iniquitie : and the earth shall rise vp against him .
The increase of his house shall depart , and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath .
<NON-VERSE> But Iob answered , and sayd ,
Heare diligently my speech , and let this be your consolations .
Suffer me that I may speake , and after that I haue spoken , mocke on .
As for mee , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
Marke mee , and be astonished , and lay your hand vpon your mouth .
Euen when I remember , I am afraid , and trembling taketh holde on my flesh .
Wherefore doe the wicked liue , become old , yea , are mightie in power ?
Their seede is established in their sight with them , and their offspring before their eyes .
Their houses are safe from feare , neither is the rod of God vpon them .
They take the timbrell and harpe , and reioyce at the sound of the organe .
They spend their daies in wealth , and in a moment goe downe to the graue .
Therefore they say vnto God , Depart from vs : for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes .
What is the Almightie , that wee should serue him ? and what profite should we haue , if we pray vnto him ?
Loe , their good is not in their hand , the counsell of the wicked is farre from me .
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out ? and how oft commeth their destruction vpon them ? God distributeth sorrowes in his anger .
They are as stubble before the winde , and as chaffe that the storme carieth away .
God layeth vp his iniquitie for his children : he rewardeth him , and he shall know it .
His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drinke of the wrath of the Almightie .
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his moneths is cut off in the middest ?
Shall any teach God knowledge ? seeing he iudgeth those that are high .
One dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet .
His breasts are full of milke , and his bones are moistened with marrow .
And another dieth in the bitternesse of his soule , and neuer eateth with pleasure .
They shall lie downe alike in the dust , and the wormes shall couer them .
Behold , I know your thoughts , and the deuices which yee wrongfully imagine against me .
For ye say , where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked ?
Haue ye not asked them that goe by the way ? and doe ye not know their tokens ?
That the wicked is reserued to the day of destruction ; they shall bee brought foorth to the day of wrath .
The cloudes of the valley shalbe sweete vnto him , and euery man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered , and said ,
Can a man be profitable vnto God ? as hee that is wise may be profitable vnto himselfe .
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that thou art righteous ? or is it gaine to him , that thou makest thy waies perfite ?
Will hee reproue thee for feare of thee ? will he enter with thee into iudgment ?
Is not thy wickednesse great ? and thine iniquities infinite ?
For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
Thou hast not giuen water to the wearie to drinke , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
But as for the mightie man , hee had the earth , and the honourable man dwelt in it .
Thou hast sent widowes away emptie , and the armes of the fatherlesse haue bene broken .
Therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden feare troubleth thee ,
Or darkenes that thou canst not see , and abundance of waters couer thee .
Is not God in the height of heauen ? and behold the height of the starres how high they are .
And thou sayest , How doth God know ? can he iudge through the darke cloude ?
Thicke cloudes are a couering to him that he seeth not , and hee walketh in the circuit of heauen .
Hast thou marked the olde way which wicked men haue troden ?
Which were cut downe out of time , whose foundation was ouerflowen with a flood .
Which said vnto God , Depart from vs , and what can the Almightie doe for them ?
Yet he filled their houses with good things : but the counsell of the wicked is farre from me .
The righteous see it , and are glad , and the innocent laugh them to scorne .
Whereas our substance is not cut downe , but the remnant of them the fire consumeth .
Acquaint now thy selfe with him , and be at peace : thereby good shal come vnto thee .
Receiue , I pray thee , the Lawe from his mouth , and lay vp his words in thine heart .
If thou returne to the Almightie , thou shalt be built vp , thou shalt put away iniquitie farre from thy tabernacles .
Then shalt thou lay vp golde as dust , and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brookes .
Yea the Almightie shall bee thy defence , and thou shalt haue plenty of siluer .
For then shalt thou haue thy delight in the Almightie , and shalt lift vp thy face vnto God .
Thou shalt make thy prayer vnto him , and he shall heare thee , and thou shalt pay thy vowes .
Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shal be established vnto thee : and the light shall shine vpon thy wayes .
When men are cast downe , then thou shalt say , There is lifting vp : and he shall saue the humble person .
Euen to day is my complaint bitter : my stroke is heauier then my groning .
O that I knewe where I might find him ! that I might come euen to his seate !
I would order my cause before him , and fill my mouth with arguments .
I would know the words which he would answere me , and vnderstand what he would say vnto me .
Will he plead against me with his great power ? No , but hee would put strength in me .
There the righteous might dispute with him ; so should I be deliuered for euer from my Iudge .
Behold , I goe forward , but he is not there , and backward , but I cannot perceiue him :
On the left hand where hee doeth worke , but I cannot behold him : he hideth himselfe on the right hand , that I cannot see him .
But he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
My foot hath held his steps , his way haue I kept , and not declined .
Neither haue I gone backe from the commaundement of his lippes , I haue esteemed the words of his mouth more then my necessary food .
But hee is in one minde , and who can turne him ? and what his soule desireth , euen that he doeth .
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for mee : and many such things are with him .
Therefore am I troubled at his presence : when I consider , I am afraid of him .
For God maketh my heart soft , and the Almighty troubleth me :
<NON-VERSE>
Why , seeing Times are not hidden from the Almightie , doe they , that know him not , see his dayes ?
Some remooue the land - markes ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
They driue away the asse of the fatherlesse , they take the widowes oxe for a pledge .
They turne the needy out of the way : the poore of the earth hide themselues together .
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they haue no couering in the cold .
They are wet with the showres of the mountaines , and imbrace the rocke for want of a shelter .
They plucke the fatherlesse from the brest , and take a pledge of the poore .
They cause him to go naked without clothing : and they take away the sheafe from the hungry ,
Which make oyle within their walles , and tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst .
Men groane from out of the city , and the soule of the wounded crieth out : yet God layeth not folly to them .
They are of those that rebell against the light , they know not the wayes thereof , nor abide in the pathes thereof .
The murderer rising with the light , killeth the poore and needy , and in the night is as a thiefe .
For the morning is to them euen as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrours of the shadow of death .
Hee is swift as the waters , their portion is cursed in the earth : he beholdeth not the way of the Uineyards .
Drought and heate consume the snow waters : so doeth the graue those which haue sinned .
The wombe shall forget him , the worme shall feed sweetly on him , hee shall be no more remembred , and wickednes shalbe broken as a tree .
He euill intreateth the barren , that beareth not : and doeth not good to the widow .
He draweth also the mighty with his power : he riseth vp , and no man is sure of life .
Though it be giuen him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet his eyes are vpon their wayes .
They are exalted for a litle while , but are gone and brought low , they are taken out of the way as al other , and cut off as the tops of the eares of corne .
<NON-VERSE>
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite , and said :
Dominion and feare are with him , hee maketh peace in his high places .
Is there any number of his armies ? and vpon whom doeth not his light arise ?
How then can man bee iustified with God ? or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman ?
Behold euen to the moone , and it shineth not , yea the starres are not pure in his sight . <NON-VERSE>
But Iob answered and sayd ,
Howe hast thou helped him that is without power ? how sauest thou the arme that hath no strength ?
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisedome ? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing , as it is ?
To whom hast thou vttered words ? and whose spirit came from thee ?
Dead things are formed from vnder the waters , and the inhabitants thereof .
Hell is naked before him , and destruction hath no couering .
He stretcheth out the North ouer the emptie place , and hangeth the earth vpon nothing .
Hee bindeth vp the waters in his thicke clouds , and the cloud is not rent vnder them .
Hee holdeth backe the face of his throne , and spreadeth his cloud vpon it .
Hee hath compassed the waters with bounds , vntill the day and night come to an end .
The pillars of heauen tremble , and are astonished at his reproofe .
Hee diuideth the sea with his power , and by his vnderstanding he smiteth through the proud .
By his spirit he hath garnished the heauens ; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer Iob continued his parable , and sayd ,
As God liueth , who hath taken away my iudgment , and the Almighty , who hath vexed my soule ;
All the while my breath is in mee , and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ;
My lips shall not speake wickednesse , nor my tongue vtter deceit .
God forbid that I should iustifie you : till I die , I will not remoue my integritie from me .
My righteousnesse I hold fast , and will not let it goe : my heart shall not reproach me so long as I liue .
Let mine enemie be as the wicked , and he that riseth vp against me , as the vnrighteous .
Will he delight himselfe in the Almightie ? will hee alwayes call vpon God ?
I will teach you by the hand of God : that which is with the Almightie , will I not conceale .
Behold , all ye your selues haue seene it , why then are yee thus altogether vaine ?
This is the portion of a wicked man with God , and the heritage of oppressours which they shall receiue of the Almightie .
If his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offpring shall not be satisfied with bread .
Those that remaine of him shall bee buried in death : and his widowes shall not weepe .
Though he heape vp siluer as the dust , and prepare rayment as the clay :
He may prepare it , but the iust shall put it on , and the innocent shall diuide the siluer .
He buildeth his house as a moth , and as a booth that the keeper maketh .
<NON-VERSE>
Hee setteth an ende to darkenesse , and searcheth out all perfection : the stones of darkenesse and the shadow of death . The floud breaketh out from the inhabitant ; euen the waters forgotten of the foote : they are dried vp , they are gone away from men .
As for the earth , out of it commeth bread : and vnder it , is turned vp as it were fire .
The lyons whelps haue not troden it , nor the fierce lyon passed by it . Hee putteth foorth his hand vpon the rocke ; hee ouerturneth the mountaines by the rootes .
Hee cutteth out riuers among the rockes , and his eye seeth euery precious thing .
He bindeth the flouds from ouerflowing , and the thing that is hid , bringeth he foorth to light .
But where shall wisedome bee found ? and where is the place of vnderstanding ?
Man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the liuing .
The depth saith , It is not in me : and the sea saith , It is not with me .
The golde and the chrystall cannot equall it : and the exchange of it shall not be for iewels of fine golde .
No mention shalbe made of Corall , or of Pearles : for the price of wisedome is aboue Rubies .
The Topaze of Ethiopia shall not equall it , neither shall it be valued with pure golde .
Whence then commeth wisedome ? and where is the place of vnderstanding ?
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all liuing , and kept close from the foules of the ayre .
Destruction and death say , Wee haue heard the fame thereof with our eares .
God vnderstandeth the way thereof , and he knoweth the place thereof .
For hee looketh to the endes of the earth , and seeth vnder the whole heauen :
To make the weight for the windes , and he weigheth the waters by measure .
When hee made a decree for the raine , and a way for the lightning of the thunder :
Then did he see it , and declare it , he prepared it , yea and searched it out .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer Iob continued his parable , and said ,
O that I were as in moneths past , as in the dayes when God preserued me .
When his candle shined vpon my head , and when by his light I walked through darkenesse :
As I was in the dayes of my youth , when the secret of God was vpon my tabernacle :
When the Almightie was yet with me , when my children were about me :
When I washed my steps with butter , and the rocke powred me out riuers of oyle :
When I went out to the gate , through the citie , when I prepared my seate in the street .
The yong men saw me , and hid themselues : and the aged arose , and stood vp .
The princes refrained talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
The Nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaued to the roofe of their mouth .
When the eare heard mee , then it blessed me , and when the eye saw me , it gaue witnesse to me :
Because I deliuered the poore that cried , and the fatherlesse , and him that had none to helpe him .
The blessing of him that was readie to perish , came vpon me : and I caused the widowes heart to sing for ioy .
I put on righteousnesse , and it clothed me : my iudgement was as a robe and a diademe .
I was eyes to the blind , and feet was I to the lame .
I was a father to the poore : and the cause which I knewe not , I searched out .
And I brake the iawes of the wicked , and pluckt the spoile out of his teeth .
After my words they spake not againe , & my speach dropped vpon them ,
And they waited for me as for the raine , and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter raine .
If I laughed on them , they beleeued it not , and the light of my countenance they cast not downe .
<NON-VERSE>
But nowe they that are yonger then I , haue mee in derision , whose fathers I would haue disdained to haue set with the dogs of my flocke .
Yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom olde age was perished ?
They were driuen foorth from among men , ( they cried after them , as after a thiefe . )
They were children of fooles , yea children of base men : they were viler then the earth .
And now am I their song , yea I am their by - word . They abhorre me , they flee farre from me , and spare not to spit in my face .
Because hee hath loosed my cord and afflicted me , they haue also let loose the bridle before me . Upon my right hand rise the youth , they push away my feete , and they raise vp against mee the wayes of their destruction .
They marre my path , they set forward my calamitie , they haue no helper .
They came vpon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselues vpon me .
Terrours are turned vpon mee : they pursue my soule as the wind : and my welfare passeth away as a cloude .
And now my soule is powred out vpon me : the dayes of affliction haue taken hold vpon me .
My bones are pierced in mee in the night season : and my sinewes take no rest .
By the great force of my disease , is my garment changed : it bindeth mee about as the collar of my coat .
He hath cast mee into the myre , and I am become like dust and ashes .
I crie vnto thee , and thou doest not heare me : I stand vp , and thou regardest me not .
Thou art become cruell to me : with thy strong hand thou opposest thy selfe against me .
Thou liftest me vp to the wind : thou causest me to ride vpon it , and dissoluest my substance .
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all liuing .
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the graue , though they cry in his destruction .
Did not I weepe for him that was in trouble ? was not my soule grieued for the poore ?
When I looked for good , then euill came vnto mee : and when I waited for light , there came darkenes .
My bowels boyled and rested not : the dayes of affliction preuented mee .
I went mourning without the Sunne : I stood vp , and I cried in the Congregation .
<NON-VERSE>
I made a couenant with mine eyes ; why then should I thinke vpon a mayd ?
For what portion of God is there from aboue ? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high ?
Is not destruction to the wicked ? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquitie ?
Doeth not he see my wayes , and count all my steps ?
If I haue walked with vanitie , or if my foot hath hasted to deceit ;
Let me bee weighed in an euen ballance , that God may know mine integritie .
If my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaued to my hands :
Then let mee sow , and let another eate , yea let my off - spring be rooted out .
If mine heart haue bene deceiued by a woman , or if I haue layde wait at my neighbours doore :
Then let my wife grind vnto another , and let others bow downe vpon her .
For this is an heinous crime , yea , it is an iniquitie to bee punished by the Iudges .
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would roote out all mine encrease .
If I did despise the cause of my man - seruant , or of my mayd - seruant , when they contended with me :
What then shall I do , when God riseth vp ? and when hee visiteth , what shall I answere him ?
Did not hee that made mee in the wombe , make him ? and did not one fashion vs in the wombe ?
If I haue withhelde the poore from their desire , or haue caused the eyes of the widow to faile :
Or haue eaten my morsell my selfe alone , and the fatherlesse hath not eaten thereof :
( For from my youth hee was brought vp with me as with a father , and I haue guided her from my mothers wombe . )
If I haue seene any perish for want of cloathing , or any poore without couering :
If his loynes haue not blessed me , and if hee were not warmed with the fleece of my sheepe :
If I haue lift vp my hand against the fatherlesse , when I saw my helpe in the gate :
Then let mine arme fall from my shoulder - blade , and mine arme be broken from the bone .
For destruction from God was a terrour to mee : and by reason of his highnesse , I could not endure .
If I haue made golde my hope , or haue said to the fine gold , Thou art my confidence :
If I reioyced because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much :
If I beheld the Sunne when it shined , or the Moone walking in brightnesse :
And my heart hath bene secretly enticed , or my mouth hath kissed my hand :
This also were an iniquitie to be punished by the Iudge : For I should haue denied the God that is aboue .
If I reioyced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lift vp my selfe when euill found him :
( Neither haue I suffered my mouth to sinne by wishing a curse to his soule . )
If the men of my tabernacle said not , Oh that we had of his flesh ! wee cannot be satisfied .
The stranger did not lodge in the street : but I opened my doores to the trauailer .
If I couered my transgressions , as Adam : by hiding mine iniquitie in my bosome :
Did I feare a great multitude , or did the contempt of families terrifie me : that I kept silence , and went not out of the doore ?
O that one would heare me ! beholde , my desire is , that the Almightie would answere me , and that mine aduersary had written a booke .
Surely I would take it vpon my shoulder , and bind it as a crowne to me .
I would declare vnto him the number of my steps , as a prince would I goe neere vnto him .
If my land cry against me , or that the furrowes likewise thereof complaine :
If I haue eaten the fruits thereof without money , or haue caused the owners thereof to loose their life :

So these three men ceased to answere Iob , because he was righteous in his owne eyes .
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu , the sonne of Barachel the Buzite , of the kinred of Ram : against Iob was his wrath kindled , because he iustified himselfe rather then God .
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled : because they had found no answere , and yet had condemned Iob .
Now Elihu had waited till Iob had spoken : because they were elder then he .
When Elihu saw that there was no answere in the mouth of these three men , then his wrath was kindled .
And Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite answered and sayd : I am yong , and yee are very old , wherefore I was afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
I said , Dayes should speake , and multitude of yeeres should teach wisedome .
But there is a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the Almightie giueth them vnderstanding .
Great men are not alwayes wise : neither doe the aged vnderstand iudgement .
Therfore I sayd , Hearken to me : I also will shew mine opinion .
Behold , I waited for your words : I gaue eare to your reasons , whilest you searched out what to say .
Yea , I attended vnto you : and beholde , there was none of you that conuinced Iob , or that answered his words :
Lest ye should say , We haue found out wisdom : God thrusteth him down , not man .
Now he hath not directed his words against me : neither will I answere him with your speeches .
They were amased , they answered no more , they left off speaking .
When I had waited , ( for they spake not , but stood still and answered no more . )
I sayd , I will answere also my part , I also will shew mine opinion .
For I am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me .
Behold , my belly is as wine , which hath no vent , it is ready to burst like new bottles . I will speake , that I may be refreshed : I will open my lippes , and answere .
Let me not , I pray you , accept any mans person : neither let me giue flattering titles vnto man .
My words shalbe of the vprightnesse of my heart : and my lippes shall vtter knowledge clearely .
The Spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me life .
If thou canst , answere me , set thy wordes in order before me , stand vp .
Behold , I am according to thy wish in Gods stead : I also am formed out of the clay .
Behold , my terrour shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heauie vpon thee .
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I haue heard the voice of thy words , saying ,
I am cleane without transgression , I am innocent ; neither is there iniquitie in me .
Behold , hee findeth occasions against mee , hee counteth mee for his enemie .
He putteth my feete in the stockes , he marketh all my pathes . Behold , in this thou art not iust : I will answere thee , That God is greater then man .
Why doest thou striue against him ? for he giueth not account of any of his matters .
For God speaketh once , yea twice , yet man perceiueth it not .
In a dreame , in a vision of the night , when deepe sleepe falleth vpon men , in slumbrings vpon the bed :
Then hee openeth the eares of men , and sealeth their instruction ,
That hee may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
Hee keepeth backe his soule from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
Hee is chastened also with paine vpon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong paine .
So that his life abhorreth bread , and his soule daintie meate .
His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seene ; and his bones that were not seene , sticke out .
His soule draweth neere vnto the graue , and his life to the destroyers .
If there be a messenger with him , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to shew vnto man his vprightnesse :
Then hee is gracious vnto him , and sayth , Deliuer him from going downe to the pit ; I haue found a ransome .
His flesh shall be fresher then a childes : he shall returne to the dayes of his youth .
He shall pray vnto God , and hee will be fauourable vnto him , and hee shall see his face with ioy : for hee will render vnto man his righteousnesse .
He looketh vpon men , and if any say , I haue sinned , and peruerted that which was right , and it profited mee not :
Hee will deliuer his soule from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
Loe , all these things worketh God oftentimes with man ,
To bring backe his soule from the pit , to be enlightened with the light of the liuing .
Marke well , O Iob , hearken vnto me , hold thy peace , and I wil speake .
If thou hast any thing to say , answere me : speake , for I desire to iustifie thee .
<NON-VERSE>
Furthermore Elihu answered , and said ,
Heare my wordes , O yee wise men , and giue eare vnto me , ye that haue knowledge .
For the eare trieth words , as the mouth tasteth meate .
Let vs chuse to vs iudgement : let vs know among our selues what is good .
For Iob hath said , I am righteous : and God hath taken away my iudgement .
Should I lye against my right ? my wound is incurable without transgression .
What man is like Iob , who drinketh vp scorning like water ?
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquitie , and walketh with wicked men .
For hee hath said , It profiteth a man nothing , that he should delight himselfe with God .
Therefore hearken vnto me , ye men of vnderstanding : farre bee it from God , that he should doe wickednes , and from the Almighty , that hee should commit iniquitie .
For the worke of a man shall he render vnto him , and cause euery man to finde according to his wayes .
Yea surely God will not doe wickedly , neither will the Almighty peruert iudgement .
Who hath giuen him a charge ouer the earth ? or who hath disposed the whole world ?
If he set his heart vpon man , if he gather vnto himselfe his spirit and his breath ;
All flesh shall perish together , and man shall turne againe vnto dust .
Is it fit to say to a King , Thou art wicked ? and to Princes , Ye are vngodly ?
How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of Princes , nor regardeth the rich more then the poore ? for they all are the woorke of his hands .
In a moment shall they die , and the people shalbe troubled at midnight , and passe away : and the mighty shall be taken away without hand .
For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man , and he seeth all his goings .
There is no darkenes , nor shadow of death , where the workers of iniquitie may hide themselues .
For hee will not lay vpon man more then right ; that he should enter into iudgement with God .
He shall breake in pieces mighty men without number , and set others in their stead .
Therefore hee knoweth their workes , and he ouerturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
He striketh them as wicked men , in the open sight of others :
Because they turned backe from him , and would not consider any of his wayes .
So that they cause the cry of the poore to come vnto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
When he giueth quietnesse , who then can make trouble ? and when hee hideth his face , who then can beholde him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man onely :
That the hypocrite raigne not , lest the people be ensnared .
Surely it is meete to be said vnto God , I haue borne chastisement , I will not offend any more .
That which I see not , teach thou me ; If I haue done iniquitie , I will doe no more .
Should it bee according to thy minde ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou chuse , and not I : therefore speake what thou knowest .
Let men of vnderstanding tell mee , and let a wise man hearken vnto mee .
Iob hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without wisdome .
My desire is that Iob may bee tried vnto the ende , because of his answeres for wicked men .
<NON-VERSE>
Elihu spake moreouer , and said ,
Thinkest thou this to bee right , that thou saydest , My righteousnesse is more then Gods ?
For thou saydst , what aduantage will it bee vnto thee , and , what profite shall I haue , if I bee cleansed from my sinne ?
I will answere thee , and thy companions with thee .
Looke vnto the heauens and see , and behold the clouds which are higher then thou .
Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art , and thy righteousnesse may profit the sonne of man .
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to crie : they crie out by reason of the arme of the mightie .
But none saith , where is God my maker , who giueth songs in the night ?
Who teacheth vs more then the beasts of the earth , and maketh vs wiser then the foules of heauen .
There they crie , ( but none giueth answere ) because of the pride of euill men .
Surely God wil not heare vanitie , neither wil the Almightie regard it .
Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him , yet iudgement is before him , therefore trust thou in him .
But now because it is not so , hee hath visited in his anger , yet he knoweth it not in great extremitie : <NON-VERSE>
Elihu also proceeded , and said ,
Suffer mee a little , and I will shewe thee , that I haue yet to speake on Gods behalfe .
I will fetch my knowledge from afarre , and will ascribe righteousnesse to my Maker .
For truely my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge , is with thee .
Behold , God is mightie , and despiseth not any : he is mightie in strength and wisedome .
He preserueth not the life of the wicked : but giueth right to the poore .
Hee withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne , yea he doth establish them for euer , and they are exalted .
And if they bee bound in fetters , and be holden in cords of affliction :
Then hee sheweth them their worke , and their transgressions , that they haue exceeded .
He openeth also their eare to discipline , and commandeth that they returne from iniquitie .
If they obey and serue him , they shall spend their dayes in prosperitie , and their yeeres in pleasures .
But if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
But the hypocrites in heart heape vp wrath : they crie not when he bindeth them .
They die in youth , and their life is among the vncleane .
He deliuereth the poore in his affliction , and openeth their eares in oppression .
Euen so would he haue remooued thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitnesse , and that which should be set on thy table , should be full of fatnesse .
But thou hast fulfilled the iudgement of the wicked : iudgement and iustice take hold on thee .
Because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his stroke : then a great ransome cannot deliuer thee .
Will he esteeme thy riches ? no not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
Desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place .
Take heed , regard not iniquitie : for this hast thou chosen rather then affliction .
Beholde , God exalteth by his power : who teacheth like him ?
Who hath inioyned him his way ? or who can say , Thou hast wrought iniquitie ?
Which the clouds doe drop , and distill vpon man aboundantly .
Also can any vnderstand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of his tabernacle ?
Behold , he spreadeth his light vpon it , and couereth the bottome of the sea .
Heare attentiuely the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth out of his mouth .
Hee directeth it vnder the whole heauen , and his lightning vnto the ends of the earth .
After it a voyce roareth : he thundreth with the voice of his excellencie , and hee will not stay them when his voice is heard .
God thundereth maruellously with his voice : great things doth hee , which we cannot comprehend .
For he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth : likewise to the small raine , and to the great raine of his strength .
He sealeth vp the hand of euery man ; that all men may knowe his worke .
Then the beastes goe into dennes : and remaine in their places .
Out of the South commeth the whirlewinde : and cold out of the North .
By the breath of God , frost is giuen : and the breadth of the waters is straitned .
Also by watring he wearieth the thicke cloud : hee scattereth his bright cloud .
And it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may doe whatsoeuer hee commaundeth them vpon the face of the world in the earth .
He causeth it to come , whether for correction , or for his land , or for mercy .
Hearken vnto this , O Iob : stand still , and consider the wondrous workes of God .
Doest thou knowe when God disposed them , and caused the light of his cloud to shine ? Doest thou know the ballancings of the clouds , the wondrous workes of him which is perfect in knowledge ?
How thy garments are warme , when hee quieteth the earth by the South wind ?
Hast thou with him spread out the skie , which is strong , and as a molten looking glasse ?
Teach vs what we shall say vnto him ; for we cannot order our speach by reason of darknes .
Shall it bee told him that I speake ? if a man speake , surely he shalbe swallowed vp .
And nowe men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but the wind passeth and cleanseth them .
Faire weather commeth out of the North : with God is terrible maiestie .
Touching the Almighty , we cannot find him out : he is excellent in power , and in iudgement , and in plenty of iustice : he will not afflict .
<NON-VERSE>
Then the Lord answered Iob out of the whirlewind , and sayd ,
Who is this that darkneth counsell by words without knowledge ?
Gird vp nowe thy loines like a man ; for I will demaund of thee , and answere thou me .
Where wast thou when I layd the foundations of the earth ? declare , if thou hast vnderstanding .
Who hath layd the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? or who hath stretched the line vpon it ?
Wherepuon are the foundations thereof fastened ? or who layd the corner stone thereof ?
When the morning starres sang together , and all the sonnes of God shouted for ioy .
Or who shut vp the sea with doores , when it brake foorth as if it had issued out of the wombe ?
When I made the cloud the garment thereof , and thicke darknesse a swadling band for it ,
And brake vp for it my decreed place , and set barres and doores ,
And said , Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and heere shall thy proud waues be stayed .
Hast thou commaunded the morning since thy daies ? and caused the day - spring to know his place ,
That it might take hold of the endes of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
It is turned as clay to the seale , and they stand as a garment .
And from the wicked their light is withholden , and the high arme shalbe broken .
Hast thou entred into the springs of the sea ? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth ?
Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee ? or hast thou seene the doores of the shadow of death ?
Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth ? Declare if thou knowest it all .
Where is the way where light dwelleth ? And as for darknesse , where is the place thereof ?
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the pathes to the house thereof .
Knowest thou it , because thou wast then borne ? or because the number of thy daies is great ?
Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snowe ? or hast thou seene the treasures of the haile ,
Which I haue reserued against the time of trouble , against the day of battaile and warre ? By what way is the light parted ? which scattereth the East wind vpon the earth .
Who hath diuided a water - course for the ouerflowing of waters ? or a way for the lightning of thunder ,
Out of whose wombe came the yce ? and the hoary frost of heauen , who hath gendred it ?
The waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deepe is frozen .
Canst thou bind the sweete influences of Pleiades ? or loose the bands of Orion ?
Canst thou lift vp thy voice to the cloudes , that abundance of waters may couer thee ?
Canst thou send lightnings , that they may goe , and say vnto thee , Here we are ? Who hath put wisedome in the inward parts ? or who hath giuen vnderstanding to the heart ?
Who can number the cloudes in wisedome ? or who can stay the bottles of heauen ,
When the dust groweeh into hardnesse , and the clods cleaue fast together ?
Wilt thou hunt the pray for the lyon ? or fill the appetite of the young lyons ,
When they couch in their dennes , and abide in the couert to lie in waite ?
<NON-VERSE>
Knowest thou the time when the wild goates of the rocke bring forth ? or canst thou marke when the hindes doe calue ?
Canst thou number the moneths that they fulfill ? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
They bowe themselues , they bring forth their young ones , they cast out their sorrowes .
Their yong ones are in good liking , they grow vp with corne : they go forth , and returne not vnto them .
Who hath sent out the wild asse free ? or who hath looosed the bands of the wild asse ?
Whose house I haue made the wildernesse , and the barren lande his dwellings .
He scorneth the multitude of the citie , neither regardeth he the crying of the driuer .
Canst thou binde the Unicorne with his band in the furrow ? or will he harrow the valleyes after thee ? Wilt thou trust him because his strength is great ? or wilt thou leaue thy labour to him ?
Wilt thou beleeue him that hee will bring home thy seed ? and gather it into thy barne ?
Gauest thou the goodly wings vnto the peacocks , or wings and feathers vnto the Ostrich ?
Which leaueth her egges in the earth , and warmeth them in dust ,
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them , or that the wilde beast may breake them .
She is hardened against her yong ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in vaine without feare .
Because God hath depriued her of wisedome , neither hath he imparted to her vnderstanding .
What time she lifteth vp her selfe on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
Hast thou giuen the horse strength ? hast thou clothed his necke with thunder ?
Canst thou make him afraid as a grashopper ? the glory of his nostrils is terrible .
He paweth in the valley , and reioyceth in his strength : hee goeth on to meet the armed men .
He mocketh at feare , and is not affrighted : neither turneth he backe from the sword .
Doeth the Eagle mount vp at thy commaund ? and make her nest on high ?
She dwelleth and abideth on the rocke , vpon the cragge of the rocke , and the strong place .
From thence she seeketh the pray , and her eyes behold a farre off .
<NON-VERSE>
Moreouer the Lord answered Iob , and said ,
Shall hee that contendeth with the Almightie , instruct him ? he that reproueth God , let him answere it .
¶ Then Iob answered the Lord , and said ,
Behold , I am vile , what shall I answere thee ? I wil lay my hand vpon my mouth .
Once haue I spoken , but I will not answere : yea twise , but I will proceed no further .
¶ Then answered the Lord vnto Iob out of the whirlewinde , and said :
Gird vp thy loynes now like a man : I will demaund of thee , and declare thou vnto me .
Wilt thou also disanul my iudgement ? Wilt thou condemne mee , that thou mayest be righteous ?
Hast thou an arme like God ? or canst thou thunder with a voyce like him ?
Decke thy selfe now with Maiestie , and excellencie , and aray thy selfe with glory , and beautie .
Hide them in the dust together , and binde their faces in secret .
Then will I also confesse vnto thee , that thine owne right hand can saue thee .
¶ Beholde now Behemoth which I made with thee , hee eateth grasse as an oxe .
Loe now , his strength is in his loynes , and his force is in the nauell of his belly .
Hee moueth his taile like a Cedar : the sinewes of his stones are wrapt together .
His bones are as strong pieces of brasse : his bones are like barres of iron .
Hee is the chiefe of the wayes of God : he that made him , can make his sword to approach vnto him .
Surely the mountaines bring him foorth foode : where all the beasts of the field play .
He lieth vnder the shady trees in the couert of the reede , and fennes .
Canst thou put an hooke into his nose ? or bore his iawe through with a thorne ?
Will he make many supplications vnto thee ? will he speake soft words vnto thee ?
Will he make a couenant with thee ? wilt thou take him for a seruant for euer ?
Wilt thou play with him as with a birde ? wilt thou binde him for thy maydens ?
Shall the companions make a banquet of him ? shall they part him among the merchants ?
Canst thou fill his skinne with barbed irons ? or his head with fishspeares ?
Lay thine hand vpon him , remember the battell : doe no more .
Behold , the hope of him is in vaine : shall not one be cast downe euen at the sight of him ? None is so fierce that dare stirre him vp : who then is able to stand before me ?
Who hath preuented me that I should repay him ? whatsoeuer is vnder the whole heauen , is mine .
His scales are his pride , shut vp together as with a close seale . One is so neere to another , that no ayre can come betweene them .
They are ioyned one to another , they sticke together , that they cannot be sundred .
By his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eye - liddes of the morning .
Out of his mouth goe burning lampes , and sparkes of fire leape out . Out of his nostrels goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron .
His breath kindleth coales , and a flame goeth out of his mouth . In his necke remaineth strength , and sorrowe is turned into ioy before him .
Hee maketh a path to shine after him ; one would thinke the deepe to bee hoarie .
Upon earth there is not his like : who is made without feare .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Iob answered the Lord , and said ,
I know that thou canst doe euery thing , and that no thought can bee withholden from thee .
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge ? therefore haue I vttered that I vnderstood not , things too wonderfull for me , which I knew not .
Heare , I beseech thee , and I will speake : I will demand of thee , and declare thou vnto me .
I haue heard of thee by the hearing of the eare : but now mine eye seeth thee .
Wherefore I abhorre my selfe , and repent in dust and ashes .
¶ And it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words vnto Iob , the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled against thee , & against thy two friends : for ye haue not spoken of mee the thing that is right , as my seruant Iob hath .
Therefore take vnto you now seuen bullocks , and seuen rammes , and goe to my seruant Iob , and offer vp for your selues a burnt offring , and my seruant Iob shal pray for you , for him wil I accept : lest I deale with you after your folly , in that ye haue not spoken of mee the thing which is right , like my seruant Iob .
So Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite went , and did according as the Lord commanded them : the Lord also accepted Iob .
And the Lord turned the captiuitie of Iob , when he prayed for his friends : also the Lord gaue Iob twice as much as he had before .
Then came there vnto him all his brethren , and all his sisters , and all they that had bin of his acquaintance before , and did eat bread with him in his house : and they bemoned him , and comforted him ouer all the euill that the Lord had brought vpon him : euery man also gaue him a piece of money , and euery one an eare - ring of gold .
So the Lord blessed the latter end of Iob , more then his beginning : for he had fourteene thousand sheepe , and sixe thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand shee asses .
He had also seuen sonnes , and three daughters .
And he called the name of the first , Iemima , and the name of the second , Kezia , and the name of the third , Keren - happuch .
And in all the land were no women found so faire as the daughters of Iob : and their father gaue them inheritance among their brethren .
After this liued Iob an hundred and fourtie yeeres , and saw his sonnes , and his sonnes sonnes , euen foure generations .

Tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation .
That which the palmer worme hath left , hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left , hath the canker - worme eaten ; and that which the canker - worme hath left , hath the caterpillar eaten .
Awake ye drunkards , and weepe , and howle all yee drinkers of wine , because of the new wine , for it is cut off from your mouth .
For a nation is come vp vpon my lande , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lyon , and he hath the cheeke - teeth of a great lyon .
He hath laide my vine waste : and barked my figge - tree : hee hath made it cleane bare , and cast it away , the branches thereof are made white .
¶ Lament like a virgine girded with sackecloth for the husband of her youth .
The meate offring and the drinke offering is cut off from the house of the Lord , the Priestes the Lords ministers mourne .
The field is wasted , the lande mourneth ; for the corne is wasted : the new wine is dried vp , the oyle languisheth .
Be yee ashamed , O yee husbandmen : howle , O yee vine - dressers , for the wheate and for the barley ; because the haruest of the field is perished .
The vine is dried vp , and the figgetree languisheth , the pomegranate tree , the palme tree also and the apple tree , euen all the trees of the field are withered : because ioy is withered away from the sonnes of men .
Gird your selues , and lament , yee Priests : howle , ye ministers of the Altar : come , lie all night in sackecloth , ye ministers of my God : for the meat offering and the drinke offering is withholden from the house of your God .
¶ Sanctifie yee a fast : call a solemne assembly : gather the Elders , and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God , and cry vnto the Lord :
Alas for the day : for the day of the Lord is at hand , and as a destruction from the Almightie shall it come .
Is not the meate cut off before your eyes , yea ioy and gladnesse from the house of our God ?
The seede is rotten vnder their clods : the garners are laide desolate : the barnes are broken downe , for the corne is withered .
How doe the beastes grone ? the heards of cattell are perplexed , because they haue no pasture , yea the flockes of sheepe are made desolate .
O Lord , to thee will I crie : for the fire hath deuoured the pastures of the wildernesse , and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the field .

Blow yee the trumpet in Zion , & sound an alarme in my holy mountaine : let all the inhabitants of the land tremble : for the day of the Lord commeth , for it is nie at hand ;

A fire deuoureth before them , and behind them a flame burneth : the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wildernes , yea and nothing shall escape them .
The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horse men , so shall they runne .
Like the noise of charets on the tops of mountaines shall they leape , like the noise of a flame of fire that deuoureth the stubble , as a strong people , set in battell aray .
Before their face the people shall be much pained : all faces shall gather blacknesse .
They shall runne like mighty men , they shall clime the wall like men of warre , and they shall march euery one on his wayes , and they shall not breake their rankes .
Neither shall one thrust another , they shall walke euery one in his path : and when they fall vpon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
They shall runne to and fro in the citie : they shall runne vpon the wall : they shall clime vp vpon the houses : they shall enter in at the windowes , like a theefe .
The earth shall quake before them , the heauens shall tremble , the Sun & the Moone shall be darke , & the starres shall withdrawe their shining .
And the Lord shall vtter his voyce before his armie , for his campe is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible , and who can abide it ?
¶ Therefore also now , saith the Lord , turne yee euen to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning .
And rent your heart and not your garments ; and turne vnto the Lord your God : for he is gracious and mercifull , slow to anger , and of great kindnesse , and repenteth him of the euill .
Who knoweth if he will returne and repent , and leaue a blessing behind him , euen a meate offring and a drinke offring vnto the Lord your God ?
¶ Blow the trumpet in Zion , sanctifie a fast , call a solemne assembly .
Gather the people : sanctifie the congregation : assemble the elders : gather the children , and those that sucke the breasts : let the bridegroome goe forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
Let the priests , the ministers of the Lord , weepe betweene the porch and the altar , & let them say ; Spare thy people O Lord , and giue not thine heritage to reproch ; that the heathen should rule ouer them : Wherefore should they say among the people , Where is their God ?
¶ Then will the Lord be iealous for his land , and pitie his people .
Yea the Lord will answere and say vnto his people ; Behold , I will send you corne and wine , and oyle , and yee shall be satisfied therewith : and I will no more make you a reproch among the heathen .
But I will remoue farre off from you the northren armie , & will driue him into a land barren and desolate , with his face toward the East sea , and his hinder part towards the vtmost Sea , and his stinke shall come vp , and his ill sauour shall come vp , because he hath done great things .
¶ Feare not , O land , be glad and reioyce : for the Lord will doe great things .
Be not afraid , yee beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wildernesse doe spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine doe yeeld their strength .
Be glad then , ye children of Zion , and reioyce in the Lord your God : for he hath giuen you the former raine moderately , and he will cause to come downe for you the raine , the former raine , & the latter raine in the first month .
And the floores shall bee full of wheate , and the fats shall ouerflowe with wine and oyle .
And I will restore to you the yeeres that the locust hath eaten , the canker worme , and the caterpiller , and the palmer worme , my great armie which I sent among you .
And ye shall eate in plentie , and be satisfied , and praise the Name of the Lord your God , that hath dealt wonderously with you : and my people shall neuer be ashamed .
And ye shal know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God , and none else : and my people shall neuer be ashamed .
¶ And it shall come to passe afterward , that I will powre out my Spirit vpon all flesh , and your sonnes and your daughters shall prophecie , your old men shall dreame dreames , your yong men shall see visions .
And also vpon the seruants , and vpon the handmaids in those dayes will I powre out my Spirit .
And I will shew wonders in the heauens , and in the earth , blood and fire , and pillars of smoke .
The Sunne shall be turned into darkenesse , and the Moone into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come .
<NON-VERSE>
For behold , in those dayes and in that time , when I shall bring againe the captiuitie of Iudah and Ierusalem ,
I wil also gather all nations , and will bring them downe into the valley of Iehoshaphat , and wil plead with them there for my people , and for my heritage Israel , whom they haue scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
And they haue cast lots for my people , and haue giuen a boy for a harlot , and solde a girle for wine , that they might drinke .
Yea and what haue ye to do with me , O Tyre and Zidon , and all the coasts of Palestine ? will ye render mee a recompence ? and if ye recompense me , swiftly and speedily will I returne your recompense vpon your owne head .
Because yee haue taken my siluer and my gold , and haue caried into your temples my goodly pleasant things .
The children also of Iudah and the children of Ierusalem haue ye sold vnto the Grecians , that yee might remoue them farre from their border .
Behold , I will raise them out of the place whither yee haue sold them , and wil returne your recompence vpon your owne head .
And I will sell your sonnes and your daughters into the hande of the children of Iudah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people farre off , for the Lord hath spoken it .
Let the heathen be wakened , and come vp to the valley of Iehoshaphat : for there will I sit to iudge all the heathen round about .
Put ye in the sickle , for the haruest is ripe , come , get you downe , for the presse is full , the fats ouerflowe , for the wickednesse is great .
Multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision : for the day of the Lord is neere in the valley of decision .
The Sunne and the Moone shall be darkened , and the starres shall withdraw their shining .
The Lord also shal roare out of Zion , and vtter his voice from Ierusalem , and the heauens and the earth shall shake , but the Lord will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God , dwelling in Zion , my holy Mountaine : then shall Ierusalem be holy , and there shall no strangers passe through her any more .
¶ And it shall come to passe in that day , that the mountaines shal drop downe new wine , and the hils shall flow with milke , and all the riuers of Iudah shall flow with waters , and a fountaine shall come forth of the house of the Lord , and shall water the valley of Shittim .
Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wildernes , for the violence against the children of Iudah , because they haue shed innocent blood in their land .
But Iudah shall dwell for euer , and Ierusalem from generation to generation .
<NON-VERSE> In the beginning was the Word , & the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
The same was in the beginning with God .
All things were made by him , and without him was not any thing made that was made .
In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
And the light shineth in darknesse , and the darknesse comprehended it not .
¶ There was a man sent from God , whose name was Iohn .
The same came for a witnesse , to beare witnesse of the light , that all men through him might beleeue .
Hee was not that light , but was sent to beare witnesse of that light .
That was the true light , which lighteth euery man that commeth into the world .
Hee was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
Hee came vnto his owne , and his owne receiued him not .
But as many as receiued him , to them gaue hee power to become the sonnes of God , euen to them that beleeue on his Name :
Which were borne , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among vs ( & we beheld his glory , the glory as of the onely begotten of the Father ) full of grace and trueth .
¶ Iohn bare witnesse of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that commeth after me , is preferred before me , for he was before me .
And of his fulnesse haue all wee receiued , and grace for grace .
For the Law was giuen by Moses , but grace and trueth came by Iesus Christ .
No man hath seene God at any time : the onely begotten Sonne , which is in the bosome of the Father , he hath declared him .
¶ And this is the record of Iohn , when the Iewes sent Priests and Leuites from Hierusalem , to aske him , Who art thou ?
And he confessed , and denied not : but confessed , I am not the Christ .
And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that Prophet ? And hee answered , No .
Then said they vnto him , Who art thou , that we may giue an answere to them that sent vs ? What sayest thou of thy selfe ?
He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wildernesse : Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the Prophet Esaias .
And they which were sent , were of the Pharises .
And they asked him , and said vnto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that Prophet ?
Iohn answered them , saying , I baptize with water , but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ,
He it is , who comming after me , is preferred before me , whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to vnloose .
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordane , where Iohn was baptizing .
¶ The next day , Iohn seeth Iesus comming vnto him , and saith , Behold the Lambe of God , which taketh away the sinne of the world .
This is he of whom I said , After me commeth a man , which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therfore am I come baptizing with water .
And Iohn bare record saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heauen , like a Doue , and it abode vpon him .
And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said vnto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , & remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost .
And I saw , and bare record , that this is the sonne of God .
¶ Againe the next day after , Iohn stood , and two of his disciples .
And looking vpon Iesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lambe of God .
And the two disciples heard him speake , and they followed Iesus .
Then Iesus turned , and saw them following , and saith vnto them , What seeke ye ? They said vnto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say being interpreted , Master ) where dwellest thou ?
He saith vnto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth houre .
One of the two which heard Iohn speake , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peters brother .
He first findeth his owne brother Simon , and saith vnto him , We haue found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
And he brought him to Iesus . And when Iesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the sonne of Iona , thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , a stone .
¶ The day following , Iesus would goe foorth into Galilee , & findeth Philip , & saith vnto him , Follow me .
Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the citie of Andrew and Peter .
Philip findeth Nathaneel , and saith vnto him , We haue found him of whom Moses in the Law , and the Prophets did write , Iesus of Nazareth the sonne of Ioseph .
And Nathaneel said vnto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith vnto him , Come and see .
Iesus saw Nathaneel comming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile .
Nathaneel sayeth vnto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Iesus answered , and said vnto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast vnder the figge tree , I saw thee .
Nathaneel answered , and saith vnto him , Rabbi , thou art the Sonne of God , thou art the king of Israel .
Iesus answered , and said vnto him , Because I said vnto thee , I saw thee vnder the figge tree , beleeuest thou ? thou shalt see greater things then these .

And the third day there was a mariage in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Iesus was there .
And both Iesus was called , and his disciples , to the mariage .
And when they wanted wine , the mother of Iesus saith vnto him , They haue no wine .
Iesus saith vnto her , Woman , what haue I to doe with thee ? mine houre is not yet come .
His mother saith vnto the seruants , Whatsoeuer he saith vnto you , doe it .
And there were set there sixe water pots of stone , after the maner of the purifying of the Iewes , conteining two or three firkins apeece .
Iesus saith vnto them , Fill the water pots with water . And they filled them vp to the brimme .
And hee saith vnto them , Drawe out now , and beare vnto the gouernor of the feast . And they bare it .
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was , ( but the seruants which drew the water knew ) the gouernor of the feast called the bridegrome ,
And saith vnto him , Euery man at the beginning doth set foorth good wine , and when men haue well drunke , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine vntill now .
This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory , and his disciples beleeued on him .
¶ After this hee went downe to Capernaum , hee and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples , and they continued there not many dayes .
¶ And the Iewes Passeouer was at hand , & Iesus went vp to Hierusalem
And found in the Temple those that sold oxen , and sheepe , and doues , and the changers of money , sitting .
And when he had made a scourge of small cordes , he droue them all out of the Temple , and the sheepe & the oxen , and powred out the changers money , and ouerthrew the tables ,
And said vnto them that sold doues Take these things hence , make not my fathers house an house of merchandize .
And his disciples remembred that it was written , The zeale of thine house hath eaten me vp .
¶ Then answered the Iewes , and said vnto him , What signe shewest thou vnto vs , seeing that thou doest these things ?
Iesus answered , and said vnto them , Destroy this temple , and in three dayes I will raise it vp .
Then said the Iewes , Fourty and six yeres was this Temple in building , and wilt thou reare it vp in three dayes ?
But he spake of the temple of his body .
When therefore hee was risen from the dead , his disciples remembred that hee had said this vnto them : and they beleeued the Scripture , and the word which Iesus had said .
¶ Now when hee was in Hierusalem at the Passeouer , in the feast day , many beleeued in his Name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
But Iesus did not commit himselfe vnto them , because he knew al men ,
<NON-VERSE>
There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Iewes :
The same came to Iesus by night , and said vnto him , Rabbi , wee know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can doe these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him .
Iesus answered , and said vnto him , Uerily , verily I say vnto thee , except a man be borne againe , he cannot see the kingdome of God .
Nicodemus saith vnto him , How can a man be borne when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mothers wombe , and be borne ?
Iesus answered , Uerily , verily I say vnto thee , except a man be borne of water and of the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdome of God .
That which is borne of the flesh , is flesh , and that which is borne of the spirit , is spirit .
Marueile not that I saide vnto thee , Ye must be borne againe .
The winde bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tel whence it commeth , and whither it goeth : So is euery one that is borne of the Spirit .
Nicodemus answered , and said vnto him , How can these things be ?
Iesus answered , and saide vnto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
Uerely , verely I say vnto thee , We speake that we doe know , and testifie that wee haue seene ; and yee receiue not our witnesse .
If I haue tolde you earthly things , and ye beleeue not : how shall ye beleeue if I tell you of heauenly things ?
And no man hath ascended vp to heauen , but hee that came downe from heauen , euen the Sonne of man which is in heauen .
¶ And as Moses lifted vp the serpent in the wildernesse : euen so must the Sonne of man be lifted vp : That whosoeuer beleeueth in him , should not perish , but haue eternall life .
¶ For God so loued the world , that he gaue his only begotten Sonne : that whosoeuer beleeueth in him , should not perish , but haue euerlasting life .
For God sent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world : but that the world through him might be saued .
¶ He that beleeueth on him , is not condemned : but hee that beleeueth not , is condemned already , because hee hath not beleeued in the Name of the onely begotten Sonne of God .
And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loued darknesse rather then light , because their deedes were euill .
For euery one that doeth euill , hateth the light , neither commeth to the light , lest his deeds should be reproued .
But hee that doeth trueth , commeth to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
¶ After these things , came Iesus and his disciples into the land of Iudea , and there hee taried with them , and baptized .
¶ And Iohn also was baptizing in Aenon , neere to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
For Iohn was not yet cast into prison .
¶ Then there arose a question between some of Iohns disciples and the Iewes , about purifying .
And they came vnto Iohn , and said vnto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Iordane , to whom thou barest witnesse , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
Iohn answered , and said , A man can receiue nothing , except it be giuen him from heauen .
Ye your selues beare me witnesse , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him .
He that hath the bride , is the bridegrome : but the friend of the bridegrome , which standeth and heareth him , reioyceth greatly because of the bridegromes voice : This my ioy therefore is fulfilled .
Hee must increase , but I must decrease .
Hee that commeth from aboue , is aboue all : hee that is of the earth , is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : hee that commeth from heauen is aboue all :
And what hee hath seene and heard , that he testifieth , and no man receiueth his testimony :
He that hath receiued his testimonie , hath set to his seale , that God is true .
For he whom God hath sent , speaketh the words of God : For God giueth not the Spirit by measure vnto him .
The Father loueth the Sonne , and hath giuen al things into his hand .

When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Iesus made and baptized moe disciples then Iohn ,
( Though Iesus himselfe baptized not , but his disciples : )
He left Iudea , and departed againe into Galile .
And hee must needs goe thorow Samaria .
Then commeth he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , neere to the parcell of ground that Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph .
Now Iacobs Well was there . Iesus therefore being wearied with his iourney , sate thus on the Well : and it was about the sixth houre .
There commeth a woman of Samaria to draw water : Iesus sayth vnto her , Giue me to drinke .
For his disciples were gone away vnto the city to buy meate .
Then saith the woman of Samaria vnto him , How is it that thou , being a Iewe , askest drinke of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? For the Iewes haue no dealings with the Samaritanes .
Iesus answered , and said vnto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that sayth to thee , Giue me to drinke ; thou wouldest haue asked of him , and hee would haue giuen thee liuing water .
The woman saith vnto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to drawe with , and the Well is deepe : from whence then hast thou that liuing water ?
Art thou greater then our father Iacob , which gaue vs the Well , and dranke thereof himselfe , and his children , and his cattell ?
Iesus answered , and said vnto her , Whosoeuer drinketh of this water , shall thirst againe :
But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shal giue him , shall neuer thirst : but the water that I shall giue him , shalbe in him a well of water springing vp into euerlasting life .
The woman saith vnto him , Sir , giue me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
Iesus saith vnto her , Goe , call thy husband , and come hither .
The woman answered , and said , I haue no husband . Iesus said vnto her , Thou hast well said , I haue no husband :
For thou hast had fiue husbands , and he whom thou now hast , is not thy husband : In that saidest thou truely .
The woman saith vnto him , Sir , I perceiue that thou art a Prophet .
Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine , and ye say , that in Hierusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
Iesus saith vnto her , Woman , beleeue me , the houre commeth when ye shall neither in this mountaine , nor yet at Hierusalem , worship the Father .
Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for saluation is of the Iewes .
But the houre commeth , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit , and in trueth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
God is a Spirit , and they that worship him , must worship him in spirit , and in trueth .
The woman saith vnto him , I know that Messias commeth , which is called Christ : when he is come , hee will tell vs all things .
Iesus sayth vnto her , I that speake vnto thee , am hee .
¶ And vpon this came his disciples , and marueiled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou , or , Why talkest thou with her ?
The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and sayth to the men ,
Come , see a man , which tolde me all things that euer I did : Is not this the Christ ?
Then they went out of the citie , and came vnto him .
¶ In the meane while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eate .
But hee said vnto them , I haue meate to eate that ye know not of .
Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eate ?
Iesus saith vnto them , My meat is , to doe the will of him that sent mee , and to finish his worke .
Say not ye , There are yet foure moneths , and then commeth haruest ? Behold , I say vnto you , Lift vp your eyes , and looke on the fields : for they are white already to haruest .
And hee that reapeth receiueth wages , and gathereth fruite vnto life eternall : that both he that soweth , and he that reapeth , may reioyce together .
And herein is that saying true : One soweth , and another reapeth .
I sent you to reape that , whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and yee are entred into their labours .
¶ And many of the Samaritanes of that citie beleeued on him , for the saying of the woman , which testified , Hee told me all that euer I did .
So when the Samaritanes were come vnto him , they besought him that he would tarie with them , and he abode there two dayes .
And many moe beleeued , because of his owne word :
And said vnto the woman , Now we beleeue , not because of thy saying , for we haue heard him our selues , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Sauiour of the world .
¶ Now after two dayes he departed thence , and went into Galilee :
For Iesus himselfe testified , that a Prophet hath no honour in his owne countrey .
Then when hee was come into Galilee , the Galileans receiued him , hauing seene all the things that hee did at Hierusalem at the Feast : for they also went vnto the Feast .
So Iesus came againe into Cana of Galilee , where hee made the water wine . And there was a certaine noble man , whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum .
When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galilee , hee went vnto him , and besought him that he would come downe , and heale his sonne : for he was at the point of death .
Then said Iesus vnto him , Except ye see signes and wonders , yee will not beleeue .
The noble man saith vnto him , Syr , come downe ere my child die .
Iesus saith vnto him , Go thy way , thy sonne liueth . And the man beleeued the word that Iesus had spoken vnto him , and he went his way .
And as he was now going down , his seruants met him , and told him , saying , Thy sonne liueth .
Then inquired hee of them the houre when he began to amend : and they said vnto him , Yesterday at the seuenth houre the feuer left him .
So the father knewe that it was at the same houre , in the which Iesus said vnto him , Thy sonne liueth , and himselfe beleeued , and his whole house .
<NON-VERSE>
After this there was a feast of the Iewes , and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem .
Now there is at Hierusalem by the sheepe market , a poole , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , hauing fiue porches .
For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole , and troubled the water : whosoeuer then first after the troubling of the water stepped in , was made whole of whatsoeuer disease he had .
And a certaine man was there , which had an infirmitie thirtie and eight yeeres .
When Iesus saw him lie , & knew that hee had beene now a long time in that case , he sayth vnto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
The impotent man answered him , Sir , I haue no man when the water is troubled , to put mee into the poole : but while I am comming , another steppeth downe before me .
Iesus sayth vnto him , Rise , take vp thy bed , and walke .
And immediatly the man was made whole , and tooke vp his bed , and walked : And on the same day was the Sabbath .
¶ The Iewes therefore said vnto him that was cured , It is the Sabbath day , it is not lawfull for thee to cary thy bed . He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said vnto me , Take vp thy bed , and walke .
Then asked they him , What man is that which said vnto thee , Take vp thy bed , and walke ?
And he that was healed , wist not who it was : for Iesus had conueyed himselfe away , a multitude being in that place .
Afterward Iesus findeth him in the Temple , & said vnto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sinne no more , lest a worse thing come vnto thee .
The man departed , and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus which had made him whole .
And therefore did the Iewes persecute Iesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the Sabbath day .
¶ But Iesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , & I worke .
Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him , not onely because hee had broken the Sabbath , but said also , that God was his father , making himselfe equall with God .
Then answered Iesus , and saide vnto them , Uerily , verily I say vnto you , The sonne can doe nothing of himselfe , but what he seeth the Father doe : for what things soeuer he doeth , these also doth the sonne likewise .
For the father loueth the sonne , and sheweth him all things that himselfe doth : & he will shew him greater works then these , that ye may marueile .
For as the Father raiseth vp the dead , and quickeneth them : euen so the Sonne quickeneth whom he will .
For the Father iudgeth no man : but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne :
That all men should honour the Son , euen as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Sonne , honoreth not the Father which hath sent him .
Uerily , verily I say vnto you , Hee that heareth my word , & beleeueth on him that sent mee , hath euerlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation : but is passed from death vnto life .
Uerily , verily I say vnto you , The houre is comming , & now is , when the dead shall heare the voice of the Sonne of God : and they that heare , shall liue .
For as the Father hath life in himselfe : so hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe :
And hath giuen him authority to execute iudgement also , because he is the Sonne of man .
Marueile not at this : for the houre is comming , in the which all that are in the graues shall heare his voice ,
And shall come foorth , they that haue done good , vnto the resurrection of life , and they that haue done euill , vnto the resurrection of damnation .
I can of mine owne selfe doe nothing : as I heare , I iudge : and my iudgement is iust , because I seeke not mine owne will , but the will of the Father , which hath sent me .
If I beare witnesse of my selfe , my witnesse is not true .
¶ There is another that beareth witnesse of me , & I know that the witnesse which he witnesseth of me , is true .
Ye sent vnto Iohn , and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth .
But I receiue not testimonie from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saued .
He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to reioyce in his light .
¶ But I haue greater witnesse then that of Iohn : for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish , the same workes that I doe , beare witnesse of mee , that the Father hath sent me .
And the Father himselfe which hath sent me , hath borne witnesse of me . Ye haue neither heard his voyce at any time , nor seene his shape .
And ye haue not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye beleeue not .
¶ Search the Scriptures , for in them ye thinke ye haue eternall life , and they are they which testifie of me .
And ye will not come to me , that ye might haue life .
I receiue not honour from men .
But I know you , that ye haue not the loue of God in you .
I am come in my Fathers name , and ye receiue me not : if another shall come in his owne Name , him ye will receiue .
How can ye beleeue , which receiue honour one of another , & seeke not the honour that commeth from God onely ?
Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , euen Moses , in whom ye trust ?
For had ye beleeued Moses , ye would haue beleeued me : for he wrote of me .

After these things Iesus went ouer the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias :
And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which hee did on them that were diseased .
And Iesus went vp into a mountaine , and there hee sate with his disciples .
And the Passeouer , a feast of the Iewes , was nigh .
¶ When Iesus then lift vp his eyes , and saw a great company come vnto him , he saith vnto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eate ?
( And this he said to proue him : for he himselfe knew what he would doe )
Philip answered him , Two hundred peny - worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that euery one of them may take a litle .
One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peters brother , saith vnto him ,
There is a lad here , which hath fiue barley loaues , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
And Iesus said , Make the men sit downe . Now there was much grasse in the place . So the men sate downe , in number about fiue thousand .
And Iesus tooke the loaues , and when he had giuen thankes , hee distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set downe , and likewise of the fishes , as much as they would .
When they were filled , he said vnto his disciples , Gather vp the fragments that remaine , that nothing be lost .
Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelue baskets with the fragments of the fiue barley loaues , which remained ouer and aboue , vnto them that had eaten .
Then those men , when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did , said , This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world .
¶ When Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take him by force , to make him a King , hee departed againe into a mountaine , himselfe alone .
And when euen was now come , his disciples went downe vnto the sea ,
And entred into a ship , and went ouer the sea towards Capernaum : and it was now darke , and Iesus was not come to them .
And the sea arose , by reason of a great winde that blew .
So when they had rowed about fiue and twentie , or thirtie furlongs , they see Iesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh vnto the ship : and they were afraid .
But he saith vnto them , It is I , be not afraid .
Then they willingly receiued him into the ship , and immediatly the ship was at the land whither they went .
¶ The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea , saw that there was none other boat there , saue that one whereinto his disciples were entred , and that Iesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone :
Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias , nigh vnto the place where they did eate bread , after that the Lord had giuen thankes :
When the people therefore saw that Iesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also tooke shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Iesus .
And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they saide vnto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
Iesus answered them , and said , Uerely , verely I say vnto you , Ye seeke me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because yee did eate of the loaues , and were filled .
Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth vnto euerlasting life , which the Sonne of man shall giue vnto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .
Then said they vnto him , What shall we doe , that we might worke the workes of God ?
Iesus answered , and said vnto them , This is the worke of God , that ye beleeue on him whom he hath sent .
They said therefore vnto him , What signe shewest thou then , that we may see , and beleeue thee ? What doest thou worke ?
Our fathers did eate Manna in the desert , as it is written , He gaue them bread from heauen to eate .
Then Iesus said vnto them , Uerely , verely I say vnto you , Moses gaue you not that bread from heauen , but my Father giueth you the true bread from heauen .
For the bread of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen , and giueth life vnto the world .
Then said they vnto him , Lord , euermore giue vs this bread .
And Iesus said vnto them , I am the bread of life : hee that commeth to me , shall neuer hunger : and he that beleeueth on me , shall neuer thirst .
But I said vnto you , that ye also haue seene me , and beleeue not .
All that the Father giueth mee , shall come to mee ; and him that commeth to me , I will in no wise cast out .
For I came downe from heauen , not to doe mine owne will , but the will of him that sent me .
And this is the Fathers wil which hath sent me , that of all which he hath giuen mee , I should lose nothing , but should raise it vp againe at the last day .
And this is the will of him that sent me , that euery one which seeth the Sonne , and beleeueth on him , may haue euerlasting life : and I will raise him vp at the last day .
The Iewes then murmured at him , because hee said , I am the bread which came downe from heauen .
And they said , Is not this Iesus the sonne of Ioseph , whose father and mother we know ? How is it then that hee sayth , I came downe from heauen ?
Iesus therefore answered , and said vnto them , Murmure not among your selues .
No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me , draw him : and I will raise him vp at the last day .
It is written in the Prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Euery man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , commeth vnto me ,
Not that any man hath seene the Father ; saue hee which is of God , hee hath seene the Father .
Uerely , verely I say vnto you , Hee that beleeueth on me , hath euerlasting life .
I am that bread of life .
Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse , and are dead .
This is the bread which commeth downe from heauen , that a man may eate thereof , and not die .
I am the liuing bread , which came downe from heauen . If any man eate of this bread , he shall liue for euer : and the bread that I will giue , is my flesh , which I will giue for the life of the world .
The Iewes therefore stroue amongst themselues , saying , How can this man giue vs his flesh to eate ?
Then Iesus sayd vnto them , Uerely , verely I say vnto you , Except yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man , and drinke his blood , yee haue no life in you .
Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternall life , and I will raise him vp at the last day .
For my flesh is meate indeed , and my blood is drinke indeed .
He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
As the liuing Father hath sent me , and I liue by the Father : so , he that eateth me , euen he shall liue by me .
This is that bread which came downe from heauen : not as your fathers did eate Manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread , shall liue for euer .
These things said hee in the Synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying , who can heare it ?
When Iesus knew in himselfe , that his disciples murmured at it , hee said vnto them , Doeth this offend you ?
What and if yee shall see the sonne of man ascend vp where hee was before ?
It is the Spirit that quickeneth , the flesh profiteth nothing : the wordes that I speake vnto you , they are Spirit , and they are life .
But there are some of you that beleeue not . For Iesus knew from the beginning , who they were that beleeued not , and who should betray him .
And he said , Therefore said I vnto you , that no man can come vnto me , except it were giuen vnto him of my Father .
¶ From that time many of his disciples went backe , and walked no more with him .
Then said Iesus vnto the twelue , Will ye also goe away ?
Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we goe ? Thou hast the words of eternall life .
And we beleeue and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Sonne of the liuing God .
Iesus answered them , Haue not I chosen you twelue , and one of you is a deuill ?
<NON-VERSE>
After these things , Iesus walked in Galilee : for hee would not walk in Iurie , because the Iewes sought to kill him .
Now the Iewes feast of Tabernacles was at hand .
His brethren therefore saide vnto him , Depart hence , and go into Iudea , that thy Disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
For there is no man that doth any thing in secret , and hee himselfe seeketh to be knowen openly : If thou doe these things , shew thy selfe to the world .
For neither did his brethren beleeue in him .
Then Iesus said vnto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
The world cannot hate you , but me it hateth , because I testifie of it , that the workes thereof are euill .
Goe ye vp vnto this feast : I goe not vp yet vnto this feast , for my time is not yet full come .
When he had said these words vnto them , he abode still in Galilee .
¶ But when his brethren were gone vp , then went he also vp vnto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
Then the Iewes sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
And there was much murmuring among the people , concerning him : For some said , Hee is a good man : Others said , Nay , but he deceiueth the people .
Howbeit , no man spake openly of him , for feare of the Iewes .
¶ Now about the middest of the feast , Iesus went vp into the Temple , and taught .
And the Iewes marueiled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , hauing neuer learned ?
Iesus answered them , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
If any man will doe his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speake of my selfe .
He that speaketh of himselfe , seeketh his owne glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no vnrighteousnesse is in him .
Did not Moses giue you the Law , and yet none of you keepeth the Law ? Why goe ye about to kill me ?
The people answered , and sayd , Thou hast a deuill : Who goeth about to kill thee ?
Iesus answered , and saide vnto them , I haue done one worke , and yee all marueile .
Moses therefore gaue vnto you Circumcision ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) and yee on the Sabbath day circumcise a man .
If a man on the Sabbath day receiue circumcision , that the Lawe of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I haue made a man euery whit whole on the Sabbath day ?
Iudge not according to the appearance , but iudge righteous iudgement .
Then said some of them of Hierusalem , Is not this hee , whome they seeke to kill ?
But loe , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing vnto him : Doe the rulers know indeede that this is the very Christ ?
Howbeit wee know this man whence he is : but when Christ commeth , no man knoweth whence he is .
Then cried Iesus in the Temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am , and I am not come of my selfe , but he that sent me , is true , whom ye know not .
But I know him , for I am from him , and he hath sent me .
Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his houre was not yet come .
And many of the people beleeued on him , & said , When Christ commeth , will hee doe moe miracles then these which this man hath done ?
¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him : And the Pharisees and the chiefe Priests sent officers to take him .
Then said Iesus vnto them , Yet a litle while am I with you , and then I goe vnto him that sent me .
Ye shall seeke me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither yee cannot come .
Then saide the Iewes among themselues , Whither will hee goe , that we shall not find him ? will he goe vnto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
What maner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seeke me , and shall not find me ? and where I am , thither ye cannot come ?
In the last day , that great day of the feast , Iesus stood , and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come vnto me , and drinke .
He that beleeueth on me , as the Scripture hath saide , out of his belly shall flow riuers of liuing water .
( But this spake he of the Spirit which they that beleeue on him , should receiue . For the holy Ghost was not yet giuen , because that Iesus was not yet glorified . )
¶ Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , saide , Of a trueth this is the Prophet .
Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
Hath not the Scripture saide , that Christ commeth of the seede of Dauid , and out of the towne of Bethlehem , where Dauid was ?
So there was diuision among the people because of him .
And some of them would haue taken him , but no man layed hands on him .
¶ Then came the officers to the chiefe Priests and Pharises , and they said vnto them , Why haue ye not brought him ?
The officers answered , Neuer man spake like this man .
Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceiued ?
Haue any of the rulers , or of the Pharises beleeued on him ?
But this people who knoweth not the Law , are cursed .
Nicodemus saith vnto them , ( He that came to Iesus by night , being one of them , )
Doth our Law iudge any man before it heare him , & know what he doth ?
They answered , and said vnto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and looke : for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet . <NON-VERSE>
Iesus went vnto the Mount of Oliues :
And earely in the morning hee came againe into the Temple , and all the people came vnto him , and he sate downe , and taught them .
And the Scribes and Pharisees brought vnto him a woman taken in adultery , and when they had set her in the mids ,
They say vnto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
Now Moses in the Law commanded vs , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
This they said , tempting him , that they might haue to accuse him . But Iesus stouped downe , and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not .
So when they continued asking him , hee lift vp himselfe , and saide vnto them , Hee that is without sinne among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
And againe , hee stouped downe , and wrote on the ground .
She saide , No man , Lord . And Iesus saide vnto her , Neither doe I condemne thee : Goe , and sinne no more .
¶ Then spake Iesus againe vnto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth mee , shall not walke in darkenesse , but shall haue the light of life .
The Pharisees therefore said vnto him , Thou bearest record of thy selfe , thy record is not true .
Iesus answered , and said vnto them , Though I beare record of my selfe , yet my record is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I goe : but ye cannot tell whence I come , and whither I goe .
Yee iudge after the flesh , I iudge no man .
And yet if I iudge , my iudgement is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
It is also written in your Law , that the testimonie of two men is true .
I am one that beare witnesse of my selfe , and the Father that sent mee , beareth witnesse of me .
Then said they vnto him , Where is thy Father ? Iesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father : if ye had knowen mee , yee should haue knowen my Father also .
These words spake Iesus in the treasury , as hee taught in the Temple : and no man layd hands on him , for his houre was not yet come .
Then saide Iesus againe vnto them , I goe my way , and ye shall seeke me , & shall die in your sinnes : Whither I goe , ye cannot come .
Then said the Iewes , Will hee kill himselfe ? because he saith , Whither I goe , ye cannot come .
And hee said vnto them , Yee are from beneath , I am from aboue : Yee are of this world , I am not of this world .
I said therefore vnto you , that ye shall die in your sinnes . For if yee beleeue not that I am hee , yee shall die in your sinnes .
Then said they vnto him , Who art thou ? And Iesus saith vnto them , Euen the same that I saide vnto you from the beginning .
I haue many things to say , and to iudge of you : But hee that sent mee is true , and I speake to the world , those things which I haue heard of him .
They vnderstood not that hee spake to them of the Father .
Then saide Iesus vnto them , When yee haue lift vp the Sonne of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I doe nothing of my selfe : but as my Father hath taught mee , I speake these things .
And he that sent me , is with me : the Father hath not left mee alone : for I doe alwayes those things that please him .
As hee spake those words , many beleeued on him .
Then said Iesus to those Iewes which beleeued on him , If ye continue in my word , then are yee my disciples indeed .
And ye shall know the Trueth , and the Trueth shall make you free .
¶ They answered him , We be Abraham seed , and were neuer in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Yee shall be made free ?
Iesus answered them , Uerily , verily I say vnto you , Whosoeuer committeth sinne , is the seruant of sinne .
And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer : but the Sonne abideth euer .
If the Sonne therfore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
I know that yee are Abrahams seed , but ye seeke to kill mee , because my word hath no place in you .
I speake that which I haue seene with my Father : and ye do that which ye haue seene with your father .
They answered , and said vnto him , Abraham is our father . Iesus sayth vnto them , If yee were Abrahams children , ye would doe the works of Abraham .
But now yee seeke to kill me , a man that hath tolde you the trueth , which I haue heard of God : this did not Abraham .
Ye doe the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not borne of fornication , wee haue one Father , euen God .
Iesus said vnto them , If God were your Father , yee would loue me , for I proceeded foorth , and came from God : neither came I of my selfe , but he sent me .
Why doe yee not vnderstand my speech ? euen because yee cannot heare my word .
Ye are of your father the deuill , and the lusts of your father ye will doe : hee was a murtherer from the beginning , and abode not in the trueth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his owne : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
And because I tell you the truth , ye beleeue me not .
Which of you conuinceth mee of sinne ? And if I say the trueth , why doe ye not beleeue me ?
He that is of God , heareth Gods words : ye therefore heare them not , because ye are not of God .
Then answered the Iewes , and said vnto him , Say wee not well that thou art a Samaritane , & hast a deuill ?
Iesus answered , I haue not a deuill : but I honour my Father , and ye doe dishonour me .
And I seeke not mine owne glory , there is one that seeketh & iudgeth .
Uerely , verely I say vnto you , If a man keepe my saying , hee shall neuer see death .
Then said the Iewes vnto him , Now we know that thou hast a deuill . Abraham is dead , and the Prophets : and thou sayest , If a man keepe my saying , he shall neuer taste of death .
Art thou greater then our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the Prophets are dead : whom makest thou thy selfe ?
Iesus answered , If I honour myselfe , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me , of whom ye say , that he is your God :
Yet ye haue not knowen him , but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shalbe a lyar like vnto you : but I know him , and keepe his saying .
Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day : and he saw it , & was glad .
Then said the Iewes vnto him , Thou art not yet fiftie yeeres olde , and hast thou seene Abraham ?
Iesus said vnto them , Uerely , verely I say vnto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
<NON-VERSE>
And as Iesus passed by , he saw a man which was blinde from his birth .
And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sinne , this man , or his parents , that he was borne blinde ?
Iesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the workes of God should be made manifest in him .
I must worke the workes of him that sent me , while it is day : the night commeth when no man can worke .
As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spettle , and he anointed the eyes of the blinde man with the clay ,
And said vnto him , Goe wash in the poole of Siloam ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therfore , and washed , and came seeing .
¶ The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seene him , that he was blinde , said , Is not this he that sate and begged ?
Some said , This is hee : others said , Hee is like him : but hee sayd , I am hee .
Therefore said they vnto him , How were thine eyes opened ?
He answered and said , A man that is called Iesus , made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said vnto me , Goe to the poole of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I receiued sight .
Then said they vnto him , Where is he ? He said , I know not .
¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
And it was the Sabbath day when Iesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
Then againe the Pharisees also asked him how he had receiued his sight . He said vnto them , Hee put clay vpon mine eyes , and I washed , and doe see .
Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because hee keepeth not the Sabbath day . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner , doe such miracles ? and there was a diuision among them .
They say vnto the blind man againe , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? He said , Hee is a Prophet .
But the Iewes did not beleeue concerning him , that hee had bin blind , and receiued his sight , vntill they called the parents of him that had receiued his sight .
And they asked them , saying , Is this your sonne , who ye say was borne blind ? how then doth he now see ?
His parents answered them , and said , We know that this is our sonne , and that he was borne blind :
But by what meanes he now seeth , we know not , or who hath opened his eyes we know not : hee is of age , aske him , he shall speake for himselfe .
These words spake his parents , because they feared the Iewes : for the Iewes had agreed already , that if any man did confesse that he was Christ , he should be put out of the Synagogue .
Therefore said his parents , He is of age , aske him .
Then againe called they the man that was blind , and said vnto him , Giue God the praise , we know that this man is a sinner .
He answered , and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : One thing I know , that whereas I was blind , now I see .
Then saide they to him againe , What did he to thee ? How opened hee thine eyes ?
He answered them , I haue told you already , and ye did not heare : wherfore would you heare it againe ? Will ye also be his disciples ?
Then they reuiled him , and said , Thou art his disciple , but we are Moses disciples .
Wee know that God spake vnto Moses : as for this fellow , we knowe not from whence he is .
The man answered , and said vnto them , Why herein is a marueilous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man bee a worshipper of God , and doth his will , him he heareth .
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde :
If this man were not of God , he could doe nothing .
They answered , and saide vnto him , Thou wast altogether borne in sinnes , and doest thou teach vs ? And they cast him out .
Iesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when hee had found him , he said vnto him , Doest thou beleeue on the Sonne of God ?
He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might beleeue on him ?
And Iesus said vnto him , Thou hast both seene him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
And he said , Lord , I beleeue : and he worshipped him .
¶ And Iesus said , For iudgment I am come into this world , that they which see not , might see , and that they which see , might be made blind .
And some of the Pharisees which were with him , heard these words , and saide vnto him , Are wee blinde also ?
<NON-VERSE>
Uerily , verily I say vnto you , He that entreth not by the doore into the sheepefold , but climeth vp some other way , the same is a theefe , and a robber .
But hee that entreth in by the doore , is the shepherd of the sheepe .
To him the porter openeth , and the sheepe heare his voyce , and he calleth his owne sheepe by name , and leadeth them out .
And when he putteth foorth his owne sheepe , he goeth before them , and the sheepe follow him : for they know his voyce .
And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him , for they know not the voyce of strangers .
This parable spake Iesus vnto them : but they vnderstood not what things they were which he spake vnto them .
Then said Iesus vnto them againe , Uerily , verily I say vnto you , I am the doore of the sheepe .
All that euer came before me , are theeues and robbers : but the sheepe did not heare them .
I am the doore by me if any man enter in , he shall be saued , and shall goe in and out , and find pasture .
The theefe commeth not , but for to steale and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might haue life , and that they might haue it more abundantly .
The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , & careth not for the sheepe .
I am the good shepheard , and know my sheepe , and am knowen of mine .
As the father knoweth me , euen so know I the father : & I lay downe my life for the sheepe .
And other sheepe I haue , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall heare my voyce ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepheard .
Therefore doth my father loue me , because I lay downe my life that I might take it againe .
No man taketh it from me , but I lay it downe of my selfe : I haue power to lay it downe , and I haue power to take it againe . This commandement haue I receiued of my father .
¶ There was a diuision therefore againe among the Iewes for these sayings .
And many of them said , He hath a deuill , and is mad , why heare ye him ?
Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a deuill . Can a deuill open the eyes of the blind ?
¶ And it was at Hierusalem the feast of the dedication , & it was winter .
And Iesus walked in the temple in Solomons porch .
Then came the Iewes round about him , and said vnto him , How long doest thou make vs to doubt ? If thou be the Christ , tell vs plainely .
Iesus answered them , I told you , and ye beleeued not : the workes that I doe in my Fathers name , they beare witnesse of me .
But ye beleeue not , because ye are not of my sheepe , as I said vnto you .
My sheepe heare my voyce , and I know them , and they follow me .
And I giue vnto them eternall life , and they shall neuer perish , neither shall any man plucke them out of my hand .
My father which gaue them me , is greater then all : and no man is able to plucke them out of my fathers hand .
I and my father are one .
Then the Iewes tooke vp stones againe to stone him .
Iesus answered them , Many good workes haue I shewed you from my Father ; for which of those workes doe ye stone me ?
The Iewes answered him , saying , For a good worke we stone thee not , but for blasphemy , and because that thou , being a man , makest thy selfe God .
Iesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , ye are gods ?
If hee called them gods , vnto whom the word of God came , and the Scripture cannot be broken :
Say ye of him , whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Sonne of God ?
If I doe not the workes of my Father , beleeue me not .
But if I doe , though yee beleeue not me , beleeue the works : that ye may know and beleeue that the Father is in me , and I in him .
Therefore they sought againe to take him : but hee escaped out of their hand ,
And went away againe beyond Iordane , into the place where Iohn at first baptized : and there he abode .
And many resorted vnto him , and said , Iohn did no miracle : but all things that Iohn spake of this man , were true .
<NON-VERSE>
Now a certaine man was sicke , named Lazarus of Bethanie , the towne of Mary , and her sister Martha .
( It was that Mary which anoynted the Lord with oyntment , and wiped his feete with her haire , whose brother Lazarus was sicke . )
Therefore his sister sent vnto him , saying , Lord , behold , hee whom thou louest , is sicke .
When Iesus heard that , hee said , This sicknesse is not vnto death , but for the glory of God , that the Sonne of God might be glorified thereby .
Now Iesus loued Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
When he had heard therefore that he was sicke , he abode two dayes still in the same place where he was .
Then after that , saith hee to his disciples , Let vs go into Iudea againe .
His disciples say vnto him , Master , the Iewes of late sought to stone thee , and goest thou thither againe ?
Iesus answered , Are there not twelue houres in the day ? If any man walke in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
But if a man walke in the night , hee stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
These things said hee , and after that , hee saith vnto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth , but I goe , that I may awake him out of sleepe .
Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleepe , he shall doe well .
Howbeit Iesus spake of his death : but they thought that hee had spoken of taking of rest in sleepe .
Then saide Iesus vnto them plainly , Lazarus is dead :
And I am glad for your sakes , that I was not there ( to the intent yee may beleeue : ) Neuerthelesse , let vs goe vnto him .
Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , vnto his fellow disciples , Let vs also goe , that we may die with him .
Then when Iesus came , hee found that hee had lien in the graue foure dayes already .
( Now Bethanie was nigh vnto Hierusalem , about fifteene furlongs off : )
And many of the Iewes came to Martha , and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
Then Martha , as soone as shee heard that Iesus was comming , went and met him : but Mary sate still in the house .
Then saide Martha vnto Iesus , Lord , if thou hadst bene here , my brother had not died .
But I know , that euen now , whatsoeuer thou wilt aske of God , God will giue it thee .
Iesus saith vnto her , Thy brother shall rise againe .
Martha sayeth vnto him , I know that he shall rise againe in the resurrection at the last day .
Iesus said vnto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : hee that beleeueth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he liue .
And whosoeuer liueth , and beleeueth in mee , shall neuer die . Beleeuest thou this ?
She saith vnto him , Yea Lord , I beleeue that thou art the Christ the Sonne of God , which should come into the world .
And when shee had so said , shee went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
Assoone as she heard that , she arose quickely , and came vnto him .
Now Iesus was not yet come into the towne , but was in that place where Martha met him .
The Iewes then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary that she rose vp hastily , and went out , followed her , saying , Shee goeth vnto the graue , to weepe there .
Then when Mary was come where Iesus was , and saw him , shee fell downe at his feete , saying vnto him , Lord , if thou hadst beene here , my brother had not dyed .
When Iesus therefore sawe her weeping , and the Iewes also weeping which came with her , hee groned in the Spirit , and was troubled ,
And said , Where haue ye laid him ? They say vnto him , Lord , come , & see .
Iesus wept .
Then said the Iewes , Behold , how he loued him .
And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blinde , haue caused that euen this man should not haue died ?
Iesus therefore againe groning in himselfe , commeth to the graue . It was a caue , and a stone lay vpon it .
Iesus said , Take yee away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , sayth vnto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath beene dead foure dayes .
Iesus saith vnto her , Said I not vnto thee , that if thou wouldst beleeue , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
Then they tooke away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Iesus lift vp his eyes , and said , Father , I thanke thee , that thou hast heard me .
And I knewe that thou hearest me alwayes : but because of the people which stand by , I said it , that they may beleeue that thou hast sent me .
And when hee thus had spoken , he cryed with a loude voice , Lazarus , come foorth .
And he that was dead , came forth , bound hand & foot with graue - clothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Iesus saith vnto them , Loose him , and let him goe .
Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary , and had seene the things which Iesus did , beleeued on him .
But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises , and tolde them what things Iesus had done .
¶ Then gathered the chiefe Priests and the Pharises a councell , and said , What doe wee ? for this man doeth many miracles .
If we let him thus alone , all men will beleeue on him , and the Romanes shall come , and take away both our place and nation .
And one of them named Caiaphas , being the high Priest that same yeere , said vnto them , Ye know nothing at all ,
Nor consider that it is expedient for vs , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
And this spake he not of himselfe : but being high Priest that yeere , he prophecied that Iesus should die for that nation :
And not for that nation only , but that also hee should gather together in one , the children of God that were scattered abroad .
Then from that day foorth , they tooke counsell together for to put him to death .
Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes : but went thence vnto a countrey neere to the wildernesse , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
¶ And the Iewes Passeouer was nigh at hand , and many went out of the countrey vp to Hierusalem before the Passeouer to purifie themselues .
Then sought they for Iesus , and spake among themselues , as they stood in the Temple , What thinke ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then Iesus , sixe dayes before the Passouer , came to Bethanie , where Lazarus was , which had bene dead , whom hee raised from the dead .
There they made him a supper , and Martha serued : but Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him .
Then tooke Mary a pound of ointment , of Spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Iesus , & wiped his feet with her haire : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
Then saith one of his disciples , Iudas Iscariot , Simons sonne , which should betray him ,
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and giuen to the poore ?
This he said , not that he cared for the poore : but because hee was a thiefe , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
Then said Iesus , Let her alone , against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
For the poore alwayes yee haue with you : but me ye haue not alwayes .
Much people of the Iewes therefore knew that he was there : and they came , not for Iesus sake onely , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
¶ But the chiefe Priests consulted , that they might put Lazarus also to death ,
Because that by reason of him many of the Iewes went away and beleeued on Iesus .
¶ On the next day , much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Iesus was comming to Hierusalem ,
Tooke branches of Palme trees , and went foorth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna , blessed is the king of Israel that commeth in the Name of the Lord .
And Iesus , when he had found a yong asse , sate thereon , as it is written ,
Feare not , daughter of Sion , behold , thy King commeth , sitting on an asses colt .
These things vnderstood not his disciples at the first : but when Iesus was glorified , then remembred they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things vnto him .
The people therefore that was with him , when he called Lazarus out of his graue , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that hee had done this miracle .
The Pharisees therefore saide among themselues , Perceiue ye how yee preuaile nothing ? Behold , the world is gone after him .
¶ And there were certaine Greeks among them , that came vp to worship at the feast :
The same came therefore to Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Iesus .
Philip commeth and telleth Andrew : and againe Andrew and Philip told Iesus .
¶ And Iesus answered them , saying , The houre is come , that the Sonne of man should be glorified .
Uerely , verely , I say vnto you , Except a corne of wheat fall into the ground , and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
He that loueth his life , shall lose it : and hee that hateth his life in this world , shall keepe it vnto life eternall .
If any man serue me , let him follow me , and where I am , there shall also my seruant be : If any man serue me , him will my father honour .
Now is my soule troubled , and what shall I say ? Father , saue me from this houre , but for this cause came I vnto this houre .
Father , glorifie thy Name . Then came there a voice from heauen , saying , I haue both glorified it , and wil glorifie it againe .
The people therefore that stood by , and heard it , said , that it thundered : others said , An Angel spake to him .
Iesus answered , and said , This voice came not because of mee , but for your sakes .
Now is the iudgement of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
And I , if I be lifted vp from the earth , will draw all men vnto me .
( This hee said , signifying what death he should die )
The people answered him , We haue heard out of the Law , that Christ abideth for euer : and how sayest thou , The Sonne of man must bee lift vp ? Who is this Sonne of man ?
Then Iesus said vnto them , Yet a little while is the light with you : walke while ye haue the light , lest darkdesse come vpon you : For he that walketh in darkenesse , knoweth not whither he goeth .
While ye haue light , beleeue in the light , that ye may bee the children of light . These things spake Iesus , and departed , and did hide himselfe from them .
¶ But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they beleeued not on him :
That the saying of Esaias the Prophet might be fulfilled , which hee spake , Lord , who hath beleeued our report ? and to whom hath the arme of the Lord beene reuealed ?
Therefore they could not beleeue , because that Esaias said againe ,
He hath blinded their eyes , and hardned their heart , that they should not see with their eyes , nor vnderstand with their heart , and be conuerted , and I should heale them .
These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
¶ Neuerthelesse , among the chiefe rulers also , many beleeued on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confesse him , lest they should be put out of the Synagogue .
For they loued the praise of men , more then the praise of God .
¶ Iesus cried , and said , He that beleeueth on me , beleeueth not on me , but on him that sent me .
And he that seeth me , seeth him that sent me .
I am come a light into the world , that whosoeuer beleeueth on me , should not abide in darkenesse .
And if any man heare my words , and beleeue not , I iudge him not ; For I came not to iudge the world , but to saue the world .
He that reiecteth me , and receiueth not my words , hath one that iudgeth him : the word that I haue spoken , the same shall iudge him in the last day .
For I haue not spoken of my selfe ; but the Father which sent me , he gaue me a commaundement what I should say , and what I should speake .
<NON-VERSE>
Now before the feast of the Passeouer , when Iesus knew that his houre was come , that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father , hauing loued his owne which were in the world , he loued them vnto the end .
And supper being ended ( the deuill hauing now put into the heart of Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne to betray him . )
Iesus knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God :
He riseth from supper , and layed aside his garments , and tooke a towell , and girded himselfe .
After that , he powreth water into a bason , and beganne to wash the disciples feete , and to wipe them with the towell wherewith he was girded .
Then commeth he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith vnto him , Lord , doest thou wash my feete ?
Iesus answered , and said vnto him , What I doe , thou knowest not now : but thou shalt know heereafter .
Peter saith vnto him , Thou shalt neuer wash my feete . Iesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
Simon Peter saith vnto him , Lord , not my feete only , but also my hands , and my head .
Iesus saith to him , He that is washed , needeth not , saue to wash his feet , but is cleane euery whit : and ye are cleane , but not all .
For he knew who should betray him , therefore said he , Ye are not all cleane .
So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set downe againe , he said vnto them , Know ye what I haue done to you ?
Ye call me Master and Lord , and ye say well : for so I am .
If I then your Lord and Master haue washed your feete , yee also ought to wash one anothers feete .
For I haue giuen you an example , that yee should doe , as I haue done to you .
Uerily , verily I say vnto you , the seruant is not greater then his lord , neither he that is sent , greater then hee that sent him .
If yee know these things , happy are ye if ye doe them .
¶ I speake not of you all , I know whom I haue chosen : but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with mee , hath lift vp his heele against me .
Now I tell you before it come , that when it is come to passe , yee may beleeue that I am he .
Uerily , verily I say vnto you , he that receiueth whomsoeuer I send , receiueth me : and he that receiueth me , receiueth him that sent me .
When Iesus had thus sayd , hee was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Uerily , verily I say vnto you , that one of you shall betray me .
Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom hee spake .
Now there was leaning on Iesus bosome one of his disciples , whom Iesus loued .
Simon Peter therefore beckened to him , that he should aske who it should be of whom he spake .
Hee then lying on Iesus breast , saith vnto him , Lord , who is it ?
Iesus answered , Hee it is to whom I shall giue a soppe , when I haue dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gaue it to Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon .
And after the soppe , Satan entred into him , Then said Iesus vnto him , That thou doest , doe quickly .
Now no man at the table knew , for what intent he spake this vnto him .
For some of them thought , because Iudas had the bagge , that Iesus had sayd vnto him , Buy those things that wee haue need of against the feast : or that he should giue some thing to the poore .
He then hauing receiued the sop , went immediatly out : and it was night .
¶ Therefore when hee was gone out , Iesus sayd , Now is the Sonne of man glorified : and God is glorified in him .
If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorifie him in himselfe , and shall straightway glorifie him .
Litle children , yet a litle while I am with you . Ye shall seeke mee , and as I said vnto the Iewes , whither I go , ye cannot come : so now I say to you .
A new commandement I giue vnto you , That yee loue one another , as I haue loued you , that yee also loue one another .
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if yee haue loue one to another .
¶ Simon Peter sayd vnto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Iesus answered him , Whither I goe , thou canst not follow me now : but thou shalt follow me afterwards .
Peter said vnto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay downe my life for thy sake .
<NON-VERSE>
Let not your heart be troubled : yee beleeue in God , beleeue also in me .
In my Fathers house are many mansions ; if it were not so , I would haue told you : I goe to prepare a place for you .
And if I goe and prepare a place for you , I will come againe , and receiue you vnto my selfe , that where I am , there ye may be also .
And whither I goe yee know , and the way ye know .
Thomas saith vnto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest : and how can we know the way ?
Iesus saith vnto him , I am the Way , the Trueth , and the Life : no man commeth vnto the Father but by mee .
If ye had knowen me , ye should haue knowen my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and haue seene him .
Philip sayth vnto him , Lord , shew vs the Father , and it sufficeth vs .
Iesus saith vnto him , Haue I bin so long time with you , and yet hast thou not knowen me , Philip ? he that hath seene me , hath seene the father , and how sayest thou then , Shew vs the father ?
Beleeuest thou not that I am in the father , and the father in mee ? The words that I speake vnto you , I speak not of my selfe : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doth the works .
Beleeue me that I am in the Father , and the Father in mee : or else beleeue me for the very workes sake .
Uerely , verely I say vnto you , he that beleeueth on me , the works that I doe , shall hee doe also , and greater workes then these shall he doe , because I goe vnto my Father .
And whatsoeuer ye shall aske in my Name , that will I doe , that the Father may be glorified in the Sonne .
If ye shall aske any thing in my Name , I will doe it .
¶ If ye loue me , keepe my commandements .
And I will pray the Father , and hee shall giue you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for euer ,
Euen the Spirit of trueth , whom the world cannot receiue , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him , for hee dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
I wil not leaue you comfortlesse , I will come to you .
Yet a litle while , and the world seeth me no more : but ye see me , because I liue , ye shall liue also .
At that day ye shall know , that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
He that hath my commandements , and keepeth them , hee it is that loueth me : and he that loueth me shall be loued of my Father , and I will loue him , and will manifest my selfe to him .
Iudas saith vnto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thy selfe vnto vs , and not vnto the world ?
Iesus answered , and saide vnto him , If a man loue mee , he will keepe my wordes : and my Father will loue him , and wee will come vnto him , and make our abode with him .
He that loueth mee not , keepeth not my sayings , and the word which you heare , is not mine , but the Fathers which sent mee .
These things haue I spoken vnto you , being yet present with you .
But the Comforter , which is the holy Ghost , whom the Father wil send in my name , he shal teach you al things , & bring al things to your remembrance , whatsoeuer I haue said vnto you .
Peace I leaue with you , my peace I giue vnto you , not as the world giueth , giue I vnto you : let not your heart bee troubled , neither let it bee afraid .
Ye haue heard how I saide vnto you , I goe away , and come againe vnto you . If ye loued mee , yee would reioyce , because I said , I go vnto the Father : for my Father is greater then I .
And now I haue told you before it come to passe , that when it is come to passe , ye might beleeue .
Heereafter I will not talke much with you : for the prince of this world commeth , and hath nothing in me .
<NON-VERSE>
I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman .
Euery branch in me that beareth not fruit , hee taketh away : and euery branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring foorth more fruit .
Now ye are cleane through the word which I haue spoken vnto you .
Abide in me , and in you : As the branch cannot beare fruit of itselfe , except it abide in the vine : no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can doe nothing .
If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered , and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall aske what ye will , and it shall be done vnto you .
Herein is my Father glorified , that ye beare much fruit , so shall ye bee my Disciples .
As the Father hath loued me , so haue I loued you : continue ye in my loue .
If ye keepe my Commandements , ye shal abide in my loue , euen as I haue kept my Fathers Commandements , and abide in his loue .
These things haue I spoken vnto you , that my ioy might remaine in you , and that your ioy might be full .
This is my Commaundement , that ye loue one another , as I haue loued you .
Greater loue hath no man then this , that a man lay downe his life for his friends .
Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoeuer I command you .
Henceforth I call you not seruants , for the seruant knoweth not what his lord doth , but I haue called you friends : for all things that I haue heard of my Father , I haue made knowen vnto you .
Ye haue not chosen me , but I haue chosen you , and ordeined you , that you should goe and bring foorth fruit , and that your fruite should remaine : that whatsoeuer ye shall aske of the Father in my Name , he may giue it you .
These things I commaund you , that ye loue one another .
If the world hate you , yee know that it hated me before it hated you .
If ye were of the world , the world would loue his owne : But because yee are not of the world , but I haue chosen you out of the world , therfore the world hateth you .
Remember the word that I said vnto you , The seruant is not greater then the Lord : if they haue persecuted me , they will also persecute you : if they haue kept my saying , they will keepe yours also .
But all these things will they doe vnto you for my Names sake , because they know not him that sent me .
If I had not come , and spoken vnto them , they had not had sinne : but now they haue no cloke for their sinne .
He that hateth me , hateth my Father also .
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sinne : but now haue they both seene , & hated both me & my father .
But this commeth to passe , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause .
But when the Comforter is come , whom I wil send vnto you from the Father , euen the Spirit of trueth , which proceedeth from the Father , hee shall testifie of me .
<NON-VERSE>
These things haue I spoken vnto you , that yee should not be offended .
They shall put you out of the Synagogues : yea , the time commeth , that whosoeuer killeth you , will thinke that hee doeth God seruice .
And these things will they doe vnto you , because they haue not knowen the Father , nor me .
But these things haue I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . And these things I said not vnto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
But now I goe my way to him that sent mee , and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
But because I haue saide these things vnto you , sorow hath filled your heart .
Neuerthelesse ; I tell you the trueth , it is expedient for you that I goe away : for if I goe not away , the Comforter will not come vnto you : but if I depart , I will send him vnto you .
And when he is come , he will reproue the world of sinne , and of righteousnesse , and of iudgement .
Of sinne , because they beleeue not on me .
Of righteousnesse , because I goe to my Father , and ye see me no more .
Of iudgement , because the prince of this world is iudged .
I haue yet many things to say vnto you , but ye cannot beare them now :
Howbeit , when hee the spirit of trueth is come , he wil guide you into all trueth : For he shall not speake of himselfe : but whatsoeuer he shall heare , that shall he speake , and he will shew you things to come .
He shall glorifie me , for he shall receiue of mine , and shall shew it vnto you .
All things that the Father hath , are mine : therefore said I that he shall take of mine , and shal shew it vnto you .
A litle while , and ye shall not see me : and againe a litle while , & ye shall see me : because I goe to the Father .
Then saide some of his disciples among themselues , What is this that he saith vnto vs , A litle while , and ye shal not see me : and againe , a litle while , and ye shall see me : and , because I goe to the Father ?
They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A litle while ? we cannot tell what he saith .
Now Iesus knew that they were desirous to aske him , & said vnto them , Doe ye enquire among your selues of that I saide , A litle while , and ye shall not see mee : and againe ; A little while and ye shall see me ?
Uerily , verily I say vnto you , that ye shall weepe and lament , but the world shall reioyce : And ye shall be sorrowfull , but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy .
A woman , when she is in trauaile , hath sorrow , because her houre is come : but assoone as she is deliuered of the child , she remembreth no more the anguish , for ioy that a man is borne into the world .
And ye now therefore haue sorrow : but I will see you againe , and your heart shall reioyce , and your ioy no man taketh from you .
And in that day ye shall aske me nothing : Uerily , verily I say vnto you , Whatsoeuer yee shall aske the Father in my Name , he will giue it you .
Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my Name : aske , and ye shall receiue , that your ioy may be full .
These things haue I spoken vnto you in prouerbs : the time commeth when I shall no more speake vnto you in prouerbes , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
At that day ye shall aske in my Name : and I say not vnto you that I will pray the Father for you :
For the Father himselfe loueth you , because ye haue loued me and haue beleeued that I came out from God .
I came foorth from the Father , and am come into the world : againe , I leaue the world , and goe to the Father .
His disciples said vnto him , Loe , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no prouerbe .
Now are we sure that thou knowest al things , and needest not that any man should aske thee : By this we beleeue that thou camest foorth from God .
Iesus answered them , Doe yee now beleeue ?
Behold , the houre commeth , yea is now come , that ye shall be scattered , euery man to his owne , and shall leaue me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .

These words spake Iesus , and lift vp his eyes to heauen , and said , Father , the houre is come , glorifie thy Sonne , that thy Sonne also may glorifie thee .
As thou hast giuen him power ouer all flesh , that he should giue eternall life to as many as thou hast giuen him .
And this is life eternall , that they might know thee the onely true God , and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent .
I haue glorified thee on the earth : I haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe .
And now O Father , glorifie thou me , with thine owne selfe , with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
I haue manifested thy Name vnto the men which thou gauest me out of the world : thine they were ; and thou gauest them me ; and they haue kept thy word .
Now they haue knowen that all things whatsoeuer thou hast giuen me , are of thee .
For I haue giuen vnto them the words which thou gauest me , and they haue receiued them , and haue knowen surely that I came out from thee , and they haue beleeued that thou didst send me .
I pray for them , I pray not for the world : but for them which thou hast giuen me , for they are thine .
And all mine are thine , and thine are mine : and I am glorified in them .
And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine owne Name , those whom thou hast giuen mee , that they may bee one , as we are .
While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy Name : those that thou gauest me , I haue kept , and none of them is lost , but the sonne of perdition : that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
And now come I to thee , and these things I speake in the world , that they might haue my ioy fulfilled in themselues .
I haue giuen them thy word , and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , euen as I am not of the world .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keepe them from the euill .
They are not of the world , euen as I am not of the world .
Sanctifie them through thy trueth : thy word is trueth .
As thou hast sent mee into the world : euen so haue I also sent them into the world .
And for their sakes I sanctifie my selfe , that they also might be sanctified through the trueth .
Neither pray I for these alone ; but for them also which shall beleeue on me through their word :
That they all may be one , as thou Father art in mee , and I in thee , that they also may bee one in vs : that the world may beleeue that thou hast sent mee .
And the glory which thou gauest me , I haue giuen them : that they may be one , euen as we are one :
I in them , and thou in mee , that they may bee made perfect in one , and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loued them , as thou hast loued me .
Father , I will that they also whom thou hast giuen me , be with me where I am , that they may behold my glory which thou hast giuen mee : for thou louedst mee before the foundation of the world .
O righteous Father , the world hath not knowen thee , but I haue knowen thee , and these haue knowen that thou hast sent me .

When Iesus had spoken these wordes , hee went foorth with his disciples ouer the Brooke Cedron , where was a garden , into the which hee entred and his disciples .
And Iudas also which betrayed him , knew the place : for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples .
Iudas then hauing receiued a band of men , and officers from the chiefe Priests and Pharisees , commeth thither with lanternes and torches , and weapons .
Iesus therefore knowing all things that should come vpon him , went foorth , and sayde vnto them , Whom seeke ye ?
They answered him , Iesus of Nazareth . Iesus saith vnto them , I am hee . And Iudas also which betraied him , stood with them .
Assoone then as he had said vnto them , I am he , they went backeward , and fell to the ground .
Then asked hee them againe , Whom seeke ye ? And they said , Iesus of Nazareth .
Iesus answered , I haue tolde you that I am he : If therefore ye seeke me , let these goe their way :
That the saying might be fulfilled which he spake , Of them which thou gauest me , haue I lost none .
Then Simon Peter hauing a sword , drewe it , and smote the high Priests seruant , & cut off his right eare : The seruants name was Malchus .
Then said Iesus vnto Peter , Put vp thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my father hath giuen me , shall I not drinke it ?
Then the band and the captaine , and officers of the Iewes , tooke Iesus , and bound him ,
And led him away to Annas first , ( for he was father in law to Caiaphas ) which was the high Priest that same yeere .
Now Caiaphas was he which gaue counsell to the Iewes , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
¶ And Simon Peter followed Iesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was knowen vnto the high Priest , and went in with Iesus into the palace of the high Priest .
But Peter stood at the doore without . Then went out that other disciple , which was knowen vnto the high Priest , and spake vnto her that kept the doore , and brought in Peter .
Then saith the damosell that kept the doore vnto Peter , Art not thou also one of this mans disciples ? He sayth , I am not .
And the seruants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coales , ( for it was colde ) and they warmed themselues : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himselfe .
¶ The high Priest then asked Iesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
Iesus answered him , I spake openly to the world , I euer taught in the Synagogue , and in the Temple , whither the Iewes alwayes resort , and in secret haue I said nothing :
Why askest thou me ? Aske them which heard me , what I haue said vnto them : behold , they know what I said .
And when hee had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by , stroke Iesus with the palme of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the hie priest so ?
Iesus answered him , If I haue spoken euill , beare witnesse of the euill : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
Now Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the high Priest .
And Simon Peter stood and warmed himselfe : They said therefore vnto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? Hee denied it , and said , I am not .
One of the seruants of the high Priests ( being his kinsman whose eare Peter cut off ) saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
Peter then denied againe , and immediatly the cocke crew .
¶ Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas vnto the hall of Iudgement : And it was earely , and they themselues went not into the Iudgement hall , lest they should be defiled : but that they might eat the Passeouer .
Pilate then went out vnto them , and said , What accusation bring you against this man ?
They answered , & said vnto him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not haue deliuered him vp vnto thee .
Then saide Pilate vnto them , Take ye him , and iudge him according to your law . The Iewes therefore said vnto him , It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death :
That the saying of Iesus might be fulfilled , which hee spake , signifying what death he should die .
Then Pilate entred into the Iudgement hall againe , and called Iesus , and saide vnto him , Art thou the King of the Iewes ?
Iesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thy selfe ? or did others tell it thee of me ?
Pilate answered , Am I a Iew ? Thine owne nation , and the chiefe Priests haue deliuered thee vnto mee : What hast thou done ?
Iesus answered , My kingdome is not of this world : if my kingdome were of this world , then would my seruants fight , that I should not be deliuered to the Iewes : but now is my kingdome not from hence .
Pilate therefore saide vnto him , Art thou a King then ? Iesus answered , Thou saiest that I am a King . To this end was I borne , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should beare witnesse vnto the trueth : euery one that is of the trueth heareth my voice .
Pilate saith vnto him , What is trueth ? And when hee had said this , he went out againe vnto the Iewes , and saith vnto them , I find in him no fault at all .
But yee haue a custome that I should release vnto you one at the Passeouer : will ye therefore that I release vnto you the king of the Iewes ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then Pilate therfore tooke Iesus , and scourged him .
And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
And said , Haile king of the Iewes : and they smote him with their hands .
Pilate therefore went foorth againe , and saith vnto them , Behold , I bring him foorth to you , that yee may know that I find no fault in him .
Then came Iesus forth , wearing the crowne of thornes , and the purple robe : and Pilate saith vnto them , Behold the man .
When the chiefe Priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucifie him , crucifie him . Pilate saith vnto them , Take ye him , and crucifie him : for I find no fault in him .
The Iewes answered him , We haue a law , and by our law he ought to die , because hee made himselfe the Son of God .
¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ,
And went againe into the iudgement hall , & saith vnto Iesus , Whence art thou ? But Iesus gaue him no answere .
Then saith Pilate vnto him , Speakest thou not vnto me ? Knowest thou not , that I haue power to crucifie thee , and haue power to release thee ?
Iesus answered , Thou couldest haue no power at all against me , except it were giuen thee from aboue : therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee , hath the greater sinne .
And from thencefore Pilate sought to release him : but the Iewes cried out , saying , If thou let this man goe , thou art not Cesars friend : whosoeuer maketh himselfe a king , speaketh against Cesar .
¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Iesus foorth , and sate downe in the iudgement seate , in a place that is called the pauement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
And it was the preparation of the Passeouer , and about the sixt houre : and he saith vnto the Iewes , Beholde your King .
But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucifie him . Pilate saith vnto them , Shall I crucifie your King ? The chiefe Priests answered , Wee haue no king but Cesar .
Then deliuered he him therfore vnto them to be crucified : and they took Iesus , and led him away .
And he bearing his crosse , went foorth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrewe , Golgotha :
Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Iesus in the middest .
¶ And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the crosse . And the writing was , IESVS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE IEWES .
This title then read many of the Iewes : for the place where Iesus was crucified , was nigh to the citie , and it was written in Hebrewe , and Greeke , and Latine .
Then said the chiefe Priests of the Iewes to Pilate , Write not , The king of the Iewes : but that he said , I am King of the Iewes .
Pilate answered , What I haue written , I haue written .
¶ Then the souldiers , when they had crucified Iesus , tooke his garments , ( and made foure parts , to euery souldier a part ) and also his coat : Now the coate was without seame , wouen from the top thorowout .
They said therefore among themselues , Let not vs rent it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall bee : that the Scripture might bee fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the souldiers did .
¶ Now there stood by the crosse of Iesus , his mother , and his mothers sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
When Iesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loued , he saith vnto his mother , Woman , behold thy sonne .
Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother . And from that houre that disciple tooke her vnto his owne home .
¶ After this , Iesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
Now there was set a vessell , full of vineger : And they filled a spunge with vineger , and put it vpon hyssope , and put it to his mouth .
When Iesus therefore had receiued the vineger , he said , It is finished , and he bowed his head , and gaue vp the ghost .
The Iewes therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remaine vpon the Crosse on the Sabbath day ( for that Sabbath day was an high day ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
Then came the souldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other , which was crucified with him .
But when they came to Iesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs .
But one of the souldiers with a speare pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
And he that saw it , bare record , and his record is true , and he knoweth that hee saith true , that yee might beleeue .
For these things were done , that the Scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken .
And againe another Scripture saith , They shall looke on him whom they piersed .
¶ And after this , Ioseph of Arimathea ( being a disciple of Iesus , but secretly for feare of the Iewes ) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Iesus , and Pilate gaue him leaue : he came therefore , and tooke the body of Iesus .
And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Iesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrhe and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
Then tooke they the body of Iesus , & wound it in linnen clothes , with the spices , as the maner of the Iewes is to burie :
Now in the place where he was crucified , there was a garden , and in the garden a new Sepulchre , wherein was neuer man yet layd .
<NON-VERSE>
The first day of the weeke , commeth Mary Magdalene earely when it was yet darke , vnto the Sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the Sepulchre .
Then she runneth and commeth to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Iesus loued , and saith vnto them , They haue taken away the Lord out of the Sepulchre , and we know not where they haue laid him .
Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the Sepulchre .
So they ranne both together , and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the Sepulchre .
And he stouping downe and looking in , saw the linnen clothes lying , yet went he not in .
Then commeth Simon Peter following him , and went into the Sepulchre , and seeth the linnen clothes lie ,
And the napkin that was about his head , not lying with the linnen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by it selfe .
Then went in also that other disciple which came first to the Sepulchre , and he saw , and beleeued .
For as yet they knew not the Scripture , that hee must rise againe from the dead .
Then the disciples went away againe vnto their owne home .
¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulchre , weeping : & as shee wept , she stouped downe , and looked into the Sepulchre ,
And seeth two Angels in white , sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feete , where the body of Iesus had layen :
And they say vnto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? Shee saith vnto them , Because they haue taken away my Lord , and I know not where they haue laied him .
And when she had thus said , she turned herselfe backe , and saw Iesus standing , and knew not that it was Iesus .
Iesus saith vnto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She supposing him to be the gardiner , saith vnto him , Sir , if thou haue borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laied him , and I will take him away .
Iesus saith vnto her , Mary . She turned herselfe , and saith vnto him , Rabboni , which is to say , Master .
Iesus saith vnto her , Touch me not : for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but goe to my brethren , and say vnto them , I ascend vnto my Father , and your Father , and to my God , and your God .
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that shee had seene the Lord , and that hee had spoken these things vnto her .
¶ Then the same day at euening , being the first day of the weeke , when the doores were shut , where the disciples were assembled for feare of the Iewes , came Iesus , and stood in the midst , and saith vnto them , Peace bee vnto you .
And when hee had so saide , hee shewed vnto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
Then said Iesus to them againe , Peace be vnto you : As my Father hath sent me , euen so send I you .
And when he had said this , hee breathed on them , and saith vnto them , Receiue ye the holy Ghost .
Whose soeuer sinnes yee remit , they are remitted vnto them , and whose soeuer sinnes yee retaine , they are retained .
¶ But Thomas one of the twelue , called Didymus , was not with them when Iesus came .
The other disciples therefore said vnto him , We haue seene the Lord . But he said vnto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nailes , and put my finger into the print of the nailes , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not beleeue .
¶ And after eight dayes , againe his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : Then came Iesus , the doores being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be vnto you .
Then saith he to Thomas Reach hither thy finger , and beholde my hands , and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side , and bee not faithlesse , but beleeuing .
And Thomas answered , and said vnto him , My Lord , and my God .
Iesus saith vnto him , Thomas , because thou hast seene mee , thou hast beleeued : blessed are they that haue not seene , and yet haue beleeued .
¶ And many other signes truely did Iesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this booke :
<NON-VERSE>
After these things Iesus shewed himselfe againe to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias , and on this wise shewed he himselfe .
There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathaneel of Cana in Galilee , and the sonnes of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
Simon Peter saith vnto them , I goe a fishing . They say vnto him , Wee also goe with thee . They went foorth and entred into a ship immediatly , and that night they caught nothing .
But when the morning was now come , Iesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus .
Then Iesus saith vnto them , Children , haue ye any meat ? They answered him , No .
And he said vnto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and yee shall finde . They cast therfore , and now they were not able to draw it , for the multitude of fishes .
Therefore that Disciple whome Iesus loued , saith vnto Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fishers coate vnto him , ( for hee was naked ) & did cast himselfe into the sea .
And the other disciples came in a litle ship ( for they were not farre from land , but as it were two hundred cubites ) dragging the net with fishes .
Assoone then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coales there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
Iesus saith vnto them , Bring of the fish , which ye haue now caught .
Simon Peter went vp , & drewe the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred and fiftie and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
Iesus saith vnto them , Come , and dine . And none of the disciples durst aske him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
Iesus then commeth , and taketh bread , and giueth them , and fish likewise .
This is nowe the third time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his disciples , after that hee was risen from the dead .
¶ So when they had dined , Iesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , sonne of Ionas , louest thou mee more then these ? He saith vnto him , Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I loue thee . He saith vnto him , Feed my lambes .
He saith to him againe the second time , Simon sonne of Ionas , louest thou me ? He saith vnto him , Yea Lord , thou knowest that I loue thee . He saith vnto him , Feed my sheepe .
He said vnto him the third time , Simon sonne of Ionas , louest thou mee ? Peter was grieued , because hee saide vnto him the third time , Louest thou me ? And he said vnto him , Lord , thou knowest all things , thou knowest that I loue thee . Iesus sayth vnto him , Feed my sheepe .
Uerily , verily I say vnto thee , when thou wast yong , thou girdedst thy selfe , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carie thee whither thou wouldest not .
This spake hee , signifying by what death he should glorifie God . And when he had spoken this , he sayth vnto him , Follow me .
Then Peter turning about , seeth the Disciple whom Iesus loued , following , which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , Lord , which is hee that betraieth thee ?
Peter seeing him , saith to Iesus , Lord , and what shall this man doe ?
Iesus saith vnto him , If I will that he tary till I come , what is that to thee ? Follow thou me .
Then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that Disciple should not die : yet Iesus sayd not vnto him , He shall not die : but , If I will that he tary till I come , what is that to thee ?
This is the Disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things , and we know that his testimonie is true .

Now the word of the Lord came vnto Ionah the sonne of Amittai , saying ,
Arise , goe to Nineueh that great citie , and cry against it : for their wickednes is come vp before me .
But Ionah rose vp to flee vnto Tarshish , from the presence of the Lord , and went downe to Ioppa , and he found a ship going to Tarshish : so he payed the fare thereof , and went downe into it , to goe with them vnto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord .
¶ But the Lord sent out a great winde into the sea , and there was a mightie tempest in the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
Then the Mariners were afraid , and cried euery man vnto his god , and cast foorth the wares that were in the ship , into the sea , to lighten it of them : but Ionah was gone downe into the sides of the ship , and hee lay , and was fast asleepe .
So the shipmaster came to him , and said vnto him ; What meanest thou , O sleeper ? Arise , call vpon thy God , if so be that God wil thinke vpon vs , that we perish not .
And they said euery one to his fellow ; Come , and let vs cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this euil is vpon vs . So they cast lots , and the lot fell vpon Ionah .
Then said they vnto him , Tel vs , we pray thee , for whose cause this euill is vpon vs : What is thine occupation ? and whence commest thou ? What is thy countrey ? and of what people art thou ?
And hee said vnto them , I am an Hebrew , and I feare the Lord the God of heauen , which hath made the sea , and the dry land .
Then were the men exceedingly afraid , and saide vnto him ; Why hast thou done this ? ( for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord , because he had told them . )
¶ Then said they vnto him , What shall we doe vnto thee , that the sea may be calme vnto vs ? ( for the sea wrought and was tempestuous . )
And he said vnto them , Take me vp , and cast mee foorth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calme vnto you : for I know that for my sake this great tempest is vpon you .
Neuerthelesse the men rowed hard to bring it to the land , but they could not : for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous against them .
Wherefore they cried vnto the Lord , and said , We beseech thee , O Lord , We beseech thee , let vs not perish for this mans life , and lay not vpon vs , innocent blood : for thou , O Lord , hast done as it pleased thee .
So they tooke vp Ionah , and cast him foorth into the sea , and the sea ceased from her raging .
Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice vnto the Lord , and made vowes .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Ionah prayed vnto the Lord his God , out of the fishes belly ,
And said , I cried by reason of mine affliction vnto the Lord , and hee heard mee ; out of the belly of hell cried I , and thou heardest my voyce .
For thou hadst cast mee into the deepe , in the middest of the Seas , and the floods compassed me about : all thy billowes & thy waues passed ouer me .
Then I said , I am cast out of thy sight ; yet I will looke againe toward thy holy Temple .
The waters compassed mee about euen to the soule ; the depth closed mee round about ; the weedes were wrapt about my head .
I went downe to the bottomes of the mountaines : the earth with her barres was about me for euer : yet hast thou brought vp my life from corruption , O Lord my God .
When my soule fainted within mee , I remembred the Lord , and my prayer came in vnto thee , into thine holy Temple .
They that obserue lying vanities , forsake their owne mercy .
But I wil sacrifice vnto thee with the voice of thanksgiuing , I will pay that that I haue vowed : saluation is of the Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
And the word of the Lordcame vnto Ionah the second time , saying ;
Arise , goe vnto Nineueh that great citie , and preach vnto it the preaching that I bid thee .
So Ionah arose and went vnto Nineueh , according to the word of the Lord : now Nineueh was an exceeding great citie of three dayes iourney .
And Ionah began to enter into the citie a dayes iourney , and hee cryed , and said ; Yet fourtie dayes , and Niniueh shalbe ouerthrowen .
¶ So the people of Nineueh beleeued God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackecloth from the greatest of them euen to the least of them .
For word came vnto the King of Nineueh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him and couered him with sackcloth , & sate in ashes .
And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineueh ( by the decree of the King and his nobles ) saying ; Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flocke taste any thing ; let them not feede , nor drinke water .
But let man and beast be couered with sackecloth , and cry mightily vnto God : yea , let them turne euery one from his euill way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
Who can tell if God will turne and repent , and turne away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
<NON-VERSE>
But it displeased Ionah exceedingly , and he was very angry .
And he prayed vnto the Lord , and sayd , I pray thee , O Lord , was not this my saying , when I was yet in my countrey ? Therefore I fledde before vnto Tarshish : for I knew that thou art a gracious God , and mercifull , slow to anger , and of great kindnesse , and repentest thee of the euill .
Therefore now , O Lord , Take , I beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die then to liue .
¶ Then said the Lord , Doest thou well to be angry ?
So Ionah went out of the citie , and sate on the East side of the city , and there made him a boothe , and sate vnder it in the shadow , till hee might see what would become of the citie .
And the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come vp ouer Ionah , that it might be a shadow ouer his head , to deliuer him from his griefe . So Ionah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
But God prepared a worme when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd that it withered .
And it came to passe when the Sunne did arise , that God prepared a vehement East wind ; and the Sunne beat vpon the head of Ionah , that hee fainted , and wished in himselfe to die , and said , It is better for me to die , then to liue .
And God said to Ionah , Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? and he said , I doe well to be angry , euen vnto death .
Then said the Lord , Thou hast had pitie on the gourde , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow , which came vp in a night , and perished in a night :

Nowe after the death of Moses the seruant of the Lord , it came to passe , that the Lord spake vnto Ioshua the sonne of Nun , Moses minister , saying ,
Moses my seruant is dead : now therefore arise , goe ouer this Iordan , thou , and all this people , vnto the land which I doe giue to them , euen to the children of Israel .
Euery place that the sole of your foote shall tread vpon , that haue I giuen vnto you , as I said vnto Moses .
From the wildernesse and this Lebanon , euen vnto the great Riuer , the riuer Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and vnto the great sea , toward the going downe of the Sunne , shalbe your coast .
There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the dayes of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not faile thee , nor forsake thee .
Bee strong , and of a good courage : for vnto this people shalt thou diuide for an inheritance the land which I sware vnto their fathers to giue them .
Onely bee thou strong , and very courageous , that thou mayest obserue to doe according to all the Law , which Moses my seruant commaunded thee : turne not from it to the right hand , or to the left , that thou mayest prosper whither soeuer thou goest .
This booke of the Law shal not depart out of thy mouth , but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest obserue to doe according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt haue good successe .
Haue not I commanded thee ? be strong , and of a good courage , bee not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the Lord thy God is with thee , whither soeuer thou goest .
¶ Then Ioshua commanded the Officers of the people , saying ,
Passe through the hoste , and command the people , saying , Prepare you victuals : for within three dayes ye shal passe ouer this Iordan , to goe in to possesse the land which the Lord your God giueth you , to possesse it .
¶ And to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh , spake Ioshua , saying ,
Remember the word which Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded you , saying , The Lord your God hath giuen you rest , and hath giuen you this land :
Your wiues , your litle ones , and your cattell shall remaine in the lande which Moses gaue you on this side Iordan ; but ye shall passe before your brethren armed , all the mightie men of valour , and helpe them :
Untill the Lord haue giuen your brethren rest , as he hath giuen you , and they also haue possessed the lande which the Lord your God giueth them : then yee shall returne vnto the land of your possession , and enioy it , which Moses the Lords seruant gaue you on this side Iordan toward the Sunne rising .
¶ And they answered Ioshua , saying , All that thou commandest vs , we will doe , and whither soeuer thou sendest vs , we will goe .
According as we hearkened vnto Moses in all things , so will we hearken vnto thee : onely the Lord thy God be with thee , as he was with Moses .

And Ioshua the sonne of Nun sent out of Shittim two men , to spie secretly , saying , Go , view the land , euen Iericho : and they went , and came into an harlots house , named Rahab , and lodged there . And it was told the king of Iericho , saying , Behold , there came men in hither to night , of the children of Israel , to search out the countrey .
And the king of Iericho sent vnto Rahab , saying , Bring forth the men that are come to thee , which are entred into thine house : for they bee come to search out all the countrey .
And the woman tooke the two men , and hid them , & said thus : There came men vnto mee , but I wist not whence they were :
And it came to passe about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was darke , that the men went out : whither the men went , I wote not : pursue after them quickely , for ye shall ouertake them .
But shee had brought them vp to the roofe of the house , and hid them with the stalkes of flaxe , which she had laid in order vpon the roofe .
And the men pursued after them the way to Iordan , vnto the foords : and assoone as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
¶ And before they were laide downe , shee came vp vnto them vpon the roofe .
And she said vnto the men , I know that the Lord hath giuen you the land , and that your terrour is fallen vpon vs , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you :
For wee haue heard how the Lord dried vp the water of the red Sea for you ; when you came out of Egypt , and what you did vnto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side Iordan , Sihon and Og ; whom ye vtterly destroyed .
And assoone as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remaine any more courage in any man , because of you : for the Lord your God , he is God in heauen aboue , and in earth beneath .
Now therfore , I pray you , sweare vnto me by the Lord , since I haue shewed you kindnesse , that ye will also shew kindnesse vnto my fathers house , and giue me a true token :
And that ye will saue aliue my father , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sisters , and all that they haue , and deliuer our liues from death .
And the men answered her , Our life for yours , if yee vtter not this our businesse . And it shall bee when the Lord hath giuen vs the land , that wee will deale kindely and truely with thee .
Then shee let them downe by a coard thorow the window : for her house was vpon the towne wall , and she dwelt vpon the wall .
And she said vnto them , Get you to the mountaine , lest the pursuers meete you ; and hide your selues there three dayes , vntill the pursuers bee returned , and afterward may ye goe your way .
And the men said vnto her , Wee will bee blamelesse of this thine oath which thou hast made vs sweare :
Behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt binde this line of scarlet threed in the window which thou didst let vs downe by : and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy fathers houshold home vnto thee .
And it shall bee , that whosoeuer shall goe out of the doores of thy house into the street , his blood shalbe vpon his head , and wee will bee guiltlesse : and whosoeuer shall bee with thee in the house , his blood shalbe on our head , if any hand be vpon him .
And if thou vtter this our businesse , then we wilbe quit of thine oath which thou hast made vs to sweare .
And shee saide , According vnto your words , so be it . And she sent them away , & they departed : and she bound the scarlet line in the window .
And they went , and came vnto the mountaine , and abode there three dayes , vntill the pursuers were returned . And the pursuers sought them thorowout all the way , but found them not .
¶ So the two men returned , and descended from the mountaine , and passed ouer , and came to Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and told him all things that befell them .

And Ioshua rose early in the morning , and they remooued from Shittim , and came to Iordan , hee and all the children of Israel , and lodged there before they passed ouer .
And it came to passe after three dayes , that the Officers went thorow the hoste ;
And they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord your God , and the Priests the Leuites bearing it , then yee shall remooue from your place , and goe after it .
Yet there shalbe a space betweene you and it , about two thousand cubites by measure : come not neere vnto it , that ye may know the way by which ye must goe : for yee haue not passed this way heretofore .
And Ioshua said vnto the people , Sanctifie your selues : for to morrow the Lord wil do wonders among you .
And Ioshua spake vnto the Priests , saying , Take vp the Arke of the Couenant , and passe ouer before the people . And they tooke vp the Arke of the Couenant , and went before the people .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua , This day wil I begin to magnifie thee in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee .
And thou shalt commaund the Priests that beare the Arke of the Couenant , saying ; When ye are come to the brinke of the water of Iordan , yee shall stand still in Iordan .
¶ And Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel , Come hither , and heare the words of the Lord your God .
And Ioshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the liuing God is among you , and that he will without faile driue out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hiuites , and the Perizzites , and Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Iebusites .
Behold , the Arke of the Couenant , euen the Lord of all the earth , passeth ouer before you , into Iordan .
Now therefore take yee twelue men out of the Tribes of Israel , out of euery Tribe a man .
And it shall come to passe , assoone as the soles of the feete of the Priestes that beare the Arke of the Lord , the Lord of all the earth , shall rest in the waters of Iordan , that the waters of Iordan shall be cut off , from the waters that come downe from aboue : and they shall stand vpon an heape .
¶ And it came to passe when the people remooued from their tents , to passe ouer Iordan , and the Priests bearing the Arke of the Couenant before the people ;
And as they that bare the Arke were come vnto Iordan , and the feet of the Priestes that bare the Arke , were dipped in the brimme of the water , ( for Iordan ouerfloweth all his banks at the time of haruest )
That the waters which came downe from aboue , stood and rose vp vpon an heape very farre , from the city Adam , that is beside Zaretan : and those that came downe toward the sea of the plaine , euen the salt sea , failed , and were cut off : and the people passed ouer right against Iericho .
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when all the people were cleane passed ouer Iordan , that the Lord spake vnto Ioshua , saying ,
Take you twelue men out of the people , out of euery tribe a man ,
And command you them , saying , Take you hence out of the mids of Iordan , out of the place where the Priests feet stood firme , twelue stones , and yee shal cary them ouer with you , and leaue them in the lodging place where you shall lodge this night .
Then Ioshua called the twelue men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of euery tribe a man :
And Ioshua said vnto them , Passe ouer before the Arke of the Lord your God into the mids of Iordan , and take ye vp euery man of you a stone vpon his shoulder , according vnto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel :
That this may be a signe among you , that when your children aske their fathers in time to come , saying , What meane you by these stones ?
Then yee shall answere them , That the waters of Iordan were cut off before the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , when it passed ouer Iordan , the waters of Iordan were cut off : and these stones shall bee for a memoriall vnto the children of Israel for euer .
And the children of Israel did so as Ioshua commanded , and tooke vp twelue stones out of the midst of Iordan , as the Lord spake vnto Ioshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel , and caried them ouer with them , vnto the place where they lodged , and laid them downe there .
And Ioshua set vp twelue stones in the midst of Iordan , in the place where the feet of the Priests which bare the Arke of the Couenant , stood : and they are there vnto this day .
¶ For the Priests which bare the Arke , stood in the midst of Iordan , vntill euery thing was finished that the Lord commanded Ioshua to speake vnto the people , according to all that Moses commanded Ioshua : and the people hasted and passed ouer .
And it came to passe when all the people were cleane passed ouer , that the Arke of the Lord passed ouer , and the Priests in the presence of the people .
And the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and halfe the tribe of Manasseh , passed ouer armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spake vnto them :
About fourty thousand prepared for war , passed ouer before the Lord vnto battell , to the plaines of Iericho .
¶ On that day the Lord magnified Ioshua in the sight of all Israel , and they feared him , as they feared Moses all the dayes of his life .
And the Lord spake vnto Ioshua , saying , Command the Priests that beare the Arke of the Testimony , that they come vp out of Iordan .
Ioshua therefore commaunded the Priests , saying , Come yee vp out of Iordan .
And it came to passe when the Priests that bare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , were come vp out of the mids of Iordan , and the soles of the Priests feete were lift vp vnto the dry land , that the waters of Iordan returned vnto their place , and flowed ouer all his banks , as they did before .
¶ And the people came vp out of Iordan on the tenth day of the first moneth , and encamped in Gilgal , in the East border of Iericho .
And those twelue stones which they tooke out of Iordan , did Ioshua pitch in Gilgal .
And he spake vnto the children of Israel , saying , When your children shal aske their fathers in time to come , saying , What meane these stones ?
Then yee shall let your children know , saying , Israel came ouer this Iordan on dry land .
For the Lord your God dried vp the waters of Iordan from before you , vntill yee were passed ouer , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which hee dried vp from before vs , vntill we were gone ouer :
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe when all the Kings of the Amorites which were on the side of Iordan Westward , and all the Kings of the Canaanites , which were by the Sea , heard that the Lord had dried vp the waters of Iordan from before the children of Israel , vntill we were passed ouer , that their heart melted ; neither was there spirit in them any more , because of the children of Israel .
¶ At that time the Lord said vnto Ioshua , Make thee sharpe kniues , and circumcise againe the children of Israel the second time .
And Ioshua made him sharpe kniues , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskinnes . And this is the cause why Ioshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , euen all the men of warre , died in the wildernes by the way after they came out of Egypt .
Now all the people that came out , were circumcised , but all the people that were borne in the wildernesse by the way , as they came foorth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
And it came to passe when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the campe , till they were whole .
And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua , This day haue I rolled away the reproch of Egypt from off you : Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal vnto this day .
¶ And the children of Israel incamped in Gilgal , and kept the Passeouer , on the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen , in the plaines of Iericho .
And they did eate of the olde corne of the land , on the morrow after the Passeouer , vnleauened cakes , and parched corne in the selfe same day .
¶ And the Manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corne of the land , neither had the children of Israel Manna any more , but they did eate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that yeere .
¶ And it came to passe when Ioshua was by Iericho , that he lift vp his eyes , and looked , and beholde , there stood a man ouer against him , with his sword dawen in his hand : and Ioshua went vnto him , and said vnto him , Art thou for vs , or for our aduersaries ?
And he said , Nay , but as captaine of the hoste of the Lord am I now come . And Ioshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said vnto him , What saith my Lord vnto his seruant ?
<NON-VERSE>
Now Iericho was straitly shut vp , because of the children of Israel : none went out , & none came in .
And the Lord said vnto Ioshua , See , I haue giuen into thine hand Iericho , and the King thereof , and the mighty men of valour .
And ye shall compasse the city , all yee men of warre , and goe round about the city once : thus shalt thou doe sixe dayes .
And seuen Priests shall beare before the Arke seuen trumpets of rams hornes : and the seuenth day yee shall compasse the city seuen times , and the Priests shall blow with the trumpets .
And it shall come to passe that when they make a long blast with the rammes - horne , and when ye heare the sound of the trumpet , all the people shall shout with a great shout : and the wall of the citie shall fall downe flat , and the people shall ascend vp euery man straight before him .
¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests , and said vnto them , Take vp the Arke of the Couenant , and let seuen Priests beare seuen trumpets of rammes - hornes , before the Arke of the Lord .
And he said vnto the people , Passe on , and compasse the city , and let him that is armed passe on before the Arke of the Lord .
¶ And it came to passe when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people , that the seuen Priestes bearing the seuen trumpets of rammes hornes , passed on before the Lord , and blew with the trumpets : and the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord followed them .
¶ And the armed men went before the Priests that blew with the trumpets : and the rereward came after the Arke , the Priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets .
And Ioshua had commanded the people , saying , Ye shall not shout , nor make any noise with your voice , neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth , vntill the day I bid you shoute , then shall ye shoute .
So the Arke of the Lord compassed the citie , going about it once : and they came into the campe , and lodged in the campe .
¶ And Ioshua rose earely in the morning , and the Priests tooke vp the Arke of the Lord .
And seuen Priests bearing seuen trumpets of rammes hornes before the Arke of the Lord , went on continually , and blew with the trumpets : and the armed men went before them , but the rereward came after the Arke of the Lord , the Priests going on and blowing with the trumpets .
And the second day they compassed the citie once , and returned into the campe : so they did sixe dayes .
And it came to passe on the seuenth day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the citie after the same maner , seuen times : only on that day they compassed the citie seuen times .
And it came to passe at the seuenth time , when the Priests blewe with the trumpets , Ioshua said vnto the people , Shout , for the Lord hath giuen you the citie .
¶ And the citie shalbe accursed , euen it , and all that are therein , to the Lord : onely Rahab the harlot shal liue , she , and all that are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
And you , in any wise keepe your selues from the accursed thing , lest yee make your selues accursed , when yee take of the accursed thing , and make the campe of Israel a curse , and trouble it .
But all the siluer , and gold , and vessels of brasse and yron , are consecrated vnto the Lord : they shall come into the treasurie of the Lord .
So the people shouted when the Priests blew with the trumpets : and it came to passe when the people heard the sound of the trumpet , and the people shouted with a great shout , that the wall fell downe flat , so that the people went vp into the citie , euery man straight before him , and they tooke the citie .
And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , yong and old , and oxe , and sheepe , and asse , with the edge of the sword .
But Ioshua had said vnto the two men that had spied out the countrey ; Goe into the harlots house , and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath , as ye sware vnto her .
And the yong men that were spies , went in , and brought out Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had : and they brought out all her kinred , and left them without the campe of Israel .
And they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : onely the siluer & the gold , and the vessels of brasse and of yron , they put into the Treasury of the house of the Lord .
And Ioshua saued Rahab the harlot aliue , and her fathers houshold , and all that she had : and she dwelleth in Israel euen vnto this day , because she hid the messengers which Ioshua sent to spy out Iericho .
¶ And Ioshua adiured them at that time , saying , Cursed be the man before the Lord , that riseth vp and buildeth this city Iericho : he shall lay the foundation therof in his first borne , and in his yongest sonne shall hee set vp the gates of it .
<NON-VERSE>
But the children of Israel committed a trespasse in the accursed thing : for Achan the sonne of Carmi , the sonne of Zabdi , the sonne of Zerah , of the tribe of Iudah , tooke of the accursed thing : and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel .
And Ioshua sent men from Iericho to Ai , which is beside Beth - auen , on the East side of Bethel , and spake vnto them , saying , Goe vp and view the countrey . And the men went vp , and viewed Ai .
And they returned to Ioshua , and said vnto him , Let not all the people goe vp : but let about two or three thousand men goe vp , and smite Ai , and make not all the people to labour thither , for they are but few .
So there went vp thither of the people about three thousand men , and they fled before the men of Ai .
And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and sixe men : for they chased them from before the gate euen vnto Shebarim , and smote them in the going downe : Wherefore the hearts of the people melted , & became as water .
¶ And Ioshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth vpon his face , before the Arke of the Lord , vntill the euentide , he and the Elders of Israel , and put dust vpon their heads .
And Ioshua said , Alas , O Lord God , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people ouer Iordan , to deliuer vs into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy vs ? Would to God we had bene content , and dwelt on the other side Iordan .
Oh Lord ! what shall I say , when Israel turneth their backes before their enemies ?
For the Canaanites , and all the inhabitants of the land shall heare of it , and shall enuiron vs round , and cut off our name from the earth : and what wilt thou doe vnto thy great Name ?
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua , Get thee vp ; wherefore liest thou thus vpon thy face ?
Israel hath sinned , and they haue also transgressed my Couenant which I commaunded them : for they haue euen taken of the accursed thing , and haue also stollen , and dissembled also , and they haue put it euen amongst their owne stuffe .
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accursed : neither will I bee with you any more , except yee destroy the accursed from amongst you .
Up , sanctifie the people , and say , Sanctifie your selues against to morrow : for thus saith the Lord God of Israel , There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemies , vntill ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
In the morning therefore ye shal be brought , according to your tribes : and it shall be that the tribe which the Lord taketh , shall come according to the families thereof , and the familie which the Lord shall take , shal come by housholdes : and the housholdes which the Lord shall take , shal come man by man .
And it shalbe that he that is taken with the accursed thing , shall bee burnt with fire , he , and all that hee hath : because he hath transgressed the couenant of the Lord , and because hee hath wrought folly in Israel .
¶ So Ioshua rose vp earely in the morning , and brought Israel by their tribes , and the tribe of Iudah was taken .
And hee brought the familie of Iudah , and he tooke the familie of the Zarhites : and he brought the familie of the Zarhites , man by man , and Zabdi was taken .
And hee brought his houshold , man by man , and Achan the sonne of Carmi , the sonne of Zabdi , the sonne of Zerah , of the tribe of Iudah , was taken .
And Ioshua said vnto Achan , My sonne , giue , I pray thee , glory to the Lord God of Israel , and make confession vnto him , and tel me now , what thou hast done , hide it not from me .
And Achan answered Ioshua , and said , Indeed I haue sinned against the Lord God of Israel , and thus and thus haue I done .
When I saw among the spoiles a goodly Babylonish garment , and two hundred shekels of siluer , and a wedge of gold of fiftie shekels weight , then I coueted them , and tooke them , and behold , they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the siluer vnder it .
¶ So Ioshua sent messengers , and they ran vnto the tent , and behold , it was hid in his tent , and the siluer vnder it .
And they tooke them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them vnto Ioshua , and vnto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
And Ioshua and all Israel with him tooke Achan the sonne of Zerah , and the siluer , and the garment , and the wedge of golde , and his sonnes , and his daughters , and his oxen , and his asses , and his sheepe , and his tent , and all that he had : and they brought them vnto the valley of Achor .
And Ioshua said , Why hast thou troubled vs ? the Lord shall trouble thee this day . And all Israel stoned him with stones , and burned them with fire , after they had stoned them with stones .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Lord said vnto Ioshua , Feare not , neither be thou dismaid : take all the people of warre with thee , and arise , goe vp to Ai : See , I haue giuen into thy hand the king of Ai , and his people , and his citie , and his land .
And thou shalt doe to Ai and her king , as thou diddest vnto Iericho and her king : Onely the spoile thereof and the cattell thereof shall ye take for a pray vnto your selues : lay thee an ambush for the citie , behind it .
¶ So Ioshua arose , and all the people of warre , to goe vp against Ai : and Ioshua chose out thirtie thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night :
And he commanded them , saying , Behold , ye shall lie in wait against the citie , euen behind the citie : goe not very farre from the citie , but be ye all ready :
And I , and all the people that are with mee , will approch vnto the citie : and it shall come to passe when they come out against vs , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( For they will come out after vs ) till we haue drawen them from the citie ; for they will say , They flee before vs , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them . Then yee shall rise vp from the ambush , and seise vpon the citie : for the Lord your God will deliuer it into your hand .
And it shall be when yee haue taken the citie , that ye shall set the citie on fire : according to the commandement of the Lord shall ye do . See , I haue commanded you .
¶ Ioshua therefore sent them foorth , and they went to lie in ambush , and abode betweene Bethel and Ai , on the West side of Ai : but Ioshua lodged that night among the people .
And Ioshua rose vp early in the morning , and numbred the people , and went vp ; he , and the Elders of Israel , before the people to Ai .
And all the people , euen the people of warre that were with him , went vp , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the North side of Ai : now there was a valley betweene them and Ai .
And he tooke about fiue thousand men , and set them to lye in ambush betweene Bethel and Ai , on the West side of the citie .
And when they had set the people , euen all the hoste that was on the North of the city , and their liers in wait on the West of the citie : Ioshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
¶ And it came to passe when the King of Ai saw it , that they hasted , and rose vp early , and the men of the citie went out against Israel to battell , hee , and all his people , at a time appointed , before the plaine , but hee wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city .
And Ioshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wildernesse .
And all the people that were in Ai , were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Ioshua , and were drawen away from the city .
And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel , that went not out after Israel : and they left the citie open , and pursued after Israel .
And the Lord said vnto Ioshua , Stretch out the speare that is in thy hand , toward Ai ; for I will giue it into thine hand . And Ioshua stretched out the speare that hee had in his hand , toward the city .
And the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ranne as soone as he had stretched out his hand : and they entred into the city , and tooke it , and hasted , and set the citie on fire .
And when the men of Ai looked behind them , they saw , and behold , the smoke of the city ascended vp to heauen , and they had no power to flee this way or that way : and the people that fled to the wildernesse , turned backe vpon the pursuers .
And when Ioshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned againe and slew the men of Ai .
And the other issued out of the citie against them , so they were in the midst of Israel ; some on this side , and some on that side , and they smote them ; so that they let none of them remaine or escape .
And the King of Ai they tooke aliue , and brought him to Ioshua .
And it came to passe when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai , in the field , in the wildernesse wherein they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , vntill they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned vnto Ai , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
And so it was that all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelue thousand , euen all the men of Ai .
For Ioshua drew not his hand backe wherewith hee stretched out the speare , vntill he had vtterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
Onely the cattell , and the spoile of that city Israel tooke for a pray vnto themselues , according vnto the word of the Lord , which he commaunded Ioshua .
And Ioshua burnt Ai , and made it an heape for euer , euen a desolation vnto this day .
And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree vntil euentide : and assoone as the sunne was downe , Ioshua commaunded that they should take his carkeise downe from the tree , and cast it at the entring of the gate of the citie , and raise thereon a great heape of stones that remaineth vnto this day .
¶ Then Ioshua built an Altar vnto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal ,
As Moses the seruant of the Lord commaunded the children of Israel , as it is written in the booke of the Law of Moses , an Altar of whole stones , ouer which no man hath lift vp any yron : and they offred theron burnt offerings vnto the Lord , and sacrificed peace offerings .
¶ And he wrote there vpon the stones a copie of the Lawe of Moses , which hee wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
And all Israel , and their Elders , and Officers , and their Iudges , stood on this side the Arke , and on that side , before the Priests the Leuites , which bare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , aswell the stranger , as he that was borne among them : halfe of them ouer against mount Gerizim , and halfe of them ouer against mount Ebal , as Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded before , that they should blesse the people of Israel .
And afterward hee read all the words of the Law , the blessings and cursings , according to all that is written in the booke of the Law .
<NON-VERSE> And it came to passe when all the kings which were on this side Iordan in the hilles , and in the valleys , and in all the coasts of the great sea , ouer against Lebanon , the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hiuite , and the Iebusite heard thereof :
That they gathered themselues together to fight with Ioshua , and with Israel , with one accord .
¶ And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Ioshua had done vnto Iericho , and to Ai , They did worke wilily , and went and made as if they had beene embassadours , and tooke old sackes vpon their asses , and wine - bottels , old , and rent , and bound vp ,
And old shooes and clowted vpon their feet , & olde garments vpon them , and all the bread of their prouision was drie and mouldie .
And they went to Ioshua vnto the campe at Gilgal , and said vnto him , and to the men of Israel , Wee be come from a farre countrey : Now therefore make ye a league with vs .
And the men of Israel said vnto the Hiuites , Peraduenture yee dwell among vs , and how shall wee make a league with you . ?
And they said vnto Ioshua , Wee are thy seruants . And Ioshua said vnto them , Who are ye ? And from whence come ye ?
And they said vnto him , From a very farre countrey thy seruants are come , because of the Name of the Lord thy God : for wee haue heard the fame of him , and all that hee did in Egypt ,
And all that hee did to the two kings of the Amorites , that were beyond Iordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , which was at Ashtaroth .
Wherefore our Elders and all the inhabitants of our countrey , spake to vs , saying , Take victuals with you for the iourney , and goe to meete them , and say vnto them , Wee are your seruants : therefore now make ye a league with vs .
This our bread , wee tooke hote for our prouision out of our houses , on the day we came forth to goe vnto you : but now behold , it is dry , & it is mouldy .
And these bottels of wine which we filled , were new , and behold , they be rent : and these our garments , and our shooes are become old , by reason of the very long iourney .
And the men tooke of their victuals , and asked not counsell at the mouth of the Lord .
And Ioshua made peace with them , and made a league with them , to let them liue : and the princes of the Congregation sware vnto them .
¶ And it came to passe at the end of three dayes , after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
And the children of Israel iourneyed , and came vnto their cities on the third day : now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kiriath iearim .
And the children of Israel smote them not , because the Princes of the Congregation had sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel : And all the Congregation murmured against the Princes .
But all the Princes said vnto all the Congregation , We haue sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
This we will doe to them ; wee will euen let them liue , lest wrath be vpon vs , because of the oath which wee sware vnto them .
And the Princes said vnto them , Let them liue , ( but let them bee hewers of wood , and drawers of water , vnto all the Congregation , ) as the Princes had promised them .
¶ And Ioshua called for them , and he spake vnto them , saying , Wherefore haue ye beguiled vs , saying , We are very farre from you ? when ye dwell among vs .
Now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you bee freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood , and drawers of water , for the house of my God .
And they answered Ioshua , and said , Because it was certainely told thy seruants , how that the Lord thy God commanded his seruant Moses to giue you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you , therefore we were sore afraid of our liues because of you , and haue done this thing .
And now behold , we are in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right vnto thee to doe vnto vs , doe .
And so did he vnto them , and deliuered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
<NON-VERSE>
Now it came to passe when Adoni - zedek King of Ierusalem , had heard how Ioshua had taken Ai , and had vtterly destroyed it , ( as he had done to Iericho , and her King , so hee had done to Ai , and her King ) and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel , and were among them ,
That they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great citie , as one of the royall cities , and because it was greater then Ai , and all the men thereof were mighty .
Wherefore Adoni - zedek King of Ierusalem , sent vnto Hoham King of Hebron , and vnto Piram , king of Iarmuth , and vnto Iaphia king of Lachish , and vnto Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
Come vp vnto me , and helpe me , that we may smite Gibeon : for it hath made peace with Ioshua , and with the children of Israel .
Therefore the fiue Kings of the Amorites , the king of Ierusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Iarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselues together , and went vp , they , and all their hostes , and encamped before Gibeon , and made warre against it .
¶ And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua to the campe to Gilgal , saying , Slacke not thy hand from thy seruants , come vp to vs quickly , and saue vs , and helpe vs : for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountaines , are gathered together against vs .
So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal , he , and all the people of warre with him , and all the mighty men of valour .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Ioshua , Feare them not : for I haue deliuered them into thine hand ; there shall not a man of them stand before thee .
Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly , and went vp from Gilgal all night . And the Lord discomfited them before Israel , and slewe them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth vp to Bethoron , and smote them to Azekah and vnto Makkedah .
And it came to passe as they fled from before Israel , and were in the going downe to Bethoron , that the Lord cast downe great stones from heauen vpon them , vnto Azekah , and they died : they were moe which died with hailestones , then they whome the children of Israel slew with the sword .
¶ Then spake Ioshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord deliuered vp the Amorites before the children of Israel , and hee said in the sight of Israel , Sunne , stand thou still vpon Gibeon , and thou Moone in the valley of Aialon .
And the Sunne stood still , and the Moone stayed , vntill the people had auenged themselues vpon their enemies . Is not this written in the booke of Iasher ? So the Sunne stood still in the midst of heauen , and hasted not to goe downe , about a whole day .
And there was no day like that , before it , or after it , that the Lord hearkened vnto the voyce of a man : for the Lord fought for Israel .
¶ And Ioshua returned , and all Israel with him , vnto the campe to Gilgal . But these fiue kings fled , and hid themselues in a caue at Makkedah .
And it was told Ioshua , saying , The fiue kings are found hid in a caue at Makkedah .
And Ioshua said , Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue , and set men by it , for to keepe them .
And stay you not , but pursue after your enemies , and smite the hindmost of them , suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the Lord your God hath deliuered them into your hand . And it came to passe when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them , entred into fenced cities .
And all the people returned to the campe to Ioshua at Makkedah in peace : none mooued his tongue against any of the children of Israel . Then said Ioshua , Open the mouth of the caue , and bring out those fiue kings vnto me out of the caue .
And they did so , and brought forth those fiue kings vnto him out of the caue , the king of Ierusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Iarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
And it came to passe when they brought out those kings vnto Ioshua , that Ioshua called for all the men of Israel , and saide vnto the captaines of the men of war which went with him , Come neere , put your feete vpon the neckes of these kings . And they came neere , and put their feet vpon the necks of them .
And Ioshua said vnto them , Feare not , nor be dismaid , bee strong , and of good courage : for thus shall the Lord doe to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
And afterward Ioshua smote them , and slew them , and hanged them on fiue trees : and they were hanging vpon the trees vntill the euening .
And it came to passe at the time of the going downe of the Sunne , that Ioshua commanded , and they tooke them downe off the trees , and cast them into the caue , wherein they had beene hid , and laid great stones in the caues mouth , which remain vntil this very day .
¶ And that day Ioshua tooke Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof hee vtterly destroyed , them , and all the soules that were therein , he let none remaine : and he did to the king of Makkedah , as hee did vnto the king of Iericho .
Then Ioshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , vnto Libnah , and fought against Libnah .
And the Lord deliuered it also and the king thereof , into the hand of Israel , and he smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the soules that were therein : He let none remaine in it , but did vnto the king therof , as he did vnto the king of Iericho .
¶ And Ioshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him , vnto Lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it .
And the Lord deliuered Lachish into the hande of Israel , which tooke it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the soules that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
¶ Then Horam king of Gezer , came vp to helpe Lachish , and Ioshua smote him and his people , vntill he had left him none remayning .
¶ And from Lachish , Ioshua passed vnto Eglon , and all Israel with him , and they encamped against it , and fought against it .
And they tooke it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the soules that were therein he vtterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
And Ioshua went vp from Eglon , and all Israel with him , vnto Hebron , and they fought against it .
And they tooke it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the soules that were therein , he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon : but destroyed it vtterly , and all the soules that were therein .
¶ And Ioshua returned , and all Israel with him to Debir , and fought against it .
And hee tooke it , and the King thereof , and all the cities thereof , and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and vtterly destroyed all the soules that were therein , he left none remayning : as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir , and to the king thereof , as he had done also to Libnah , and to her king .
¶ So Ioshua smote all the countrey of the hils , and of the South , and of the vale , and of the springs , and all their kings , hee left none remayning , but vtterly destroyed all that breathed , as the Lord God of Israel commanded .
And Ioshua smote them from Kadesh - Barnea , euen vnto Gaza , and all the countrey of Goshen , euen vnto Gibeon .
And all these Kings and their land did Ioshua take at one time : because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel .

And it came to passe , when Iabin king of Hazor had heard those things , that hee sent to Iobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , & to the king of Achshaph ,
And to the kings that were on the North of the mountaines , and of the plaines South of Cinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor , on the West ;
And to the Canaanite on the East and on the West , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Iebusite in the mountaines , and to the Hiuite vnder Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
And they went out , they and all their hostes with them , much people , euen as the sand that is vpon the Seashore in multitude , with horses and charets very many .
And when all these Kings were met together , they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom , to fight against Israel .
¶ And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua , Be not afraid because of them : for to morrow about this time will I deliuer them vp al slaine before Israel : thou shalt hough their horses , and burne their charets with fire .
So Ioshua came , and all the people of warre with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly , and they fell vpon them .
And the Lord deliuered them into the hand of Israel , who smote them , and chased them vnto great Zidon , and vnto Misrephothmaim , and vnto the valley of Mizpeh Eastward , and they smote them , vntill they left them none remayning .
And Ioshua did vnto them as the Lord bade him : hee houghed their horses , and burnt their charets with fire .
¶ And Ioshua at that time turned backe , and tooke Hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword : for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdomes .
And they smote all the soules that were therein with the edge of the sword , vtterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe ; and he burnt Hazor with fire .
And all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Ioshua take , and smote them with the edge of the sword , and he vtterly destroied them , as Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded .
But as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , saue Hazor onely ; that did Ioshua burne .
And all the spoile of these cities , and the cattell , the children of Israel tooke for a pray vnto themselues : but euery man they smote with the edge of the sword , vntill they had destroyed them , neither left they any to breathe .
¶ As the Lord commanded Moses his seruant , so did Moses command Ioshua , and so did Ioshua : hee left nothing vndone of all that the Lord commanded Moses .
So Ioshua tooke all that land , the hilles , and all the South countrey , and all the land of Goshen , and the valley , and the plaine , and the mountaine of Israel , and the valley of the same :
Euen from the mount Halak , that goeth vp to Seir , vnto Baal - Gad , in the valley of Lebanon , vnder mount Hermon : and all their kings he tooke , and smote them , and slew them .
Ioshua made warre a long time , with all those kings .
There was not a citie that made peace with the children of Israel , saue the Hiuites the inhabitants of Gibeon ; all other they tooke in battell .
For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battell , that he might destroy them vtterly , & that they might haue no fauour : but that hee might destroy them , as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And at that time came Ioshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountaines , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountaines of Iudah , and from all the mountaines of Israel : Ioshua destroyed them vtterly with their cities .
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : onely in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .

Now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side Iordan , toward the rising of the Sunne : from the riuer Arnon , vnto mount Hermon , and all the plaine on the East .
Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon , and ruled from Aroer , which is vpon the banke of the riuer of Arnon , and from the middle of the riuer , and from halfe Gilead vnto the riuer Iabbok ; which is the border of the children of Ammon :

Now Ioshua was old and stricken in yeeres , and the Lord saide vnto him ; Thou art old , and stricken in yeres , and there remaineth yet very much land to bee possessed .
This is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the Philistines , and all Geshuri ,
From Sihor , which is before Egypt , euen vnto the borders of Ekron Northward , which is counted to the Canaanite : fiue lords of the Philistines ; the Gazathites , and the Ashdothites , the Eshkalonites , the Gittites , and the Ekronites ; Also the Auites .
From the South , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians , vnto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites :
And the land of the Giblites , and al Lebanon toward the Sunne rising , from Baal - Gad vnder mount Hermon , vnto the entring into Hamath .
All the inhabitants of the hill countrey , from Lebanon vnto Misrephothmaim , and all the Sidonians , them will I driue out from before the children of Israel : onely diuide thou it by lot vnto the Israelites , for an inheritance , as I haue commanded thee .
Now therefore , diuide this land for an inheritance vnto the nine tribes , and the halfe tribe of Manasseh ,
With whom the Reubenites , and the Gadites haue receiued their inheritance , which Moses gaue them , beyond Iordan Eastward , euen as Moses the seruant of the Lord gaue them : From Aroer that is vpon the banke of the riuer Arnon , and the citie that is in the middest of the riuer , and all the plaine of Medeba vnto Dibon :
And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , vnto the border of the children of Ammon :
And Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites , and Maachathites , and all mount Hermon , and all Bashan vnto Salcah :
All the kingdome of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
Neuerthelesse , the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites , nor the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwel among the Israelites vntill this day .
Onely vnto the tribe of Leui hee gaue none inheritance : the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire , are their inheritance , as he said vnto them .
¶ And Moses gaue vnto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families :
And their coast was from Aroer that is on the banke of the riuer Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the riuer , and all the plaine by Medeba .
Heshbon and all her cities that are in the plaine : Dibon , and Bamoth - Baal , and Beth - Baalmeon , And Iahazah , and Kedemoth , and Mephaath ,
And Kiriathaim , and Sibmah , and Zareth - shahar , in the mount of the valley ,
And Bethpeor , and Ashdoth - Pisgah , and Beth - ieshimoth :
And all the cities of the plaine , and all the kingdome of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian , Eui , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , which were dukes of Sihon , dwelling in the countrey .
¶ Balaam also the sonne of Beor the Sooth - sayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword , among them that were slaine by them .
And the border of the children of Reuben , was Iordan and the border therof : This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities , and villages thereof .
And Moses gaue inheritance vnto the tribe of Gad , euen vnto the children of Gad , according to their families : And their coast was Iazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and halfe the land of the children of Ammon , vnto Aroer that is before Rabbah :
And from Heshbon vnto Ramath - Mizpeh , and Betonim : and from Mahanaim vnto the border of Debir .
And in the valley , Beth - aram , and Beth - nimrah , and Succoth , and Zaphon the rest of the kingdome of Sihon king of Heshbon , Iordan , and his border , euen vnto the edge of the sea of Cinneroth , on the other side Iordan Eastward .
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families : the cities and their villages .
¶ And Moses gaue inheritance vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the halfe tribe of Manasseh , by their families .
And their coast was from Mahanaim all Bashan , all the kingdome of Og king of Bashan , and all the townes of Iair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities :
And halfe Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were perteining vnto the children of Machir the sonne of Manasseh , euen to the one halfe of the children of Machir by their families .
These are the countreyes which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plaines of Moab , on the other side Iordan by Iericho Eastward .
<NON-VERSE> And these are the countreys which the children of Israel inherited in the lande of Canaan , which Eleazar the Priest , & Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them :
By lot was their inheritance , as the Lord commanded by the hande of Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the halfe tribe . For Moses had giuen the inheritance of two tribes and an halfe tribe , on the other side Iordan : but vnto the Leuites hee gaue none inheritance among them .
For the children of Ioseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim : therefore they gaue no part vnto the Leuites in the land , saue cities to dwell in , with their suburbs for their cattell , and for their substance .
As the Lord commaunded Moses , so the children of Israel did , and they diuided the land .
¶ Then the children of Iudah came vnto Ioshua in Gilgal : and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite , said vnto him , Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said vnto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee , in Kadesh Barnea .
Fourtie yeeres olde was I when Moses the seruant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea , to espie out the land , and I brought him worde againe , as it was in mine heart .
Neuerthelesse , my brethren that went vp with me , made the heart of the people melt : but I wholly followed the Lord my God .
And Moses sware on that day , saying , Surely the land whereon thy feet haue troden , shall be thine inheritance , and thy childrens for euer , because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God .
And now beholde , the Lord hath kept me aliue , as he said , these forty and fiue yeres , euen since the Lord spake this word vnto Moses , while the children of Israel wandered in the wildernesse : and now loe , I am this day fourescore and fiue yeeres old .
As yet I am as strong this day , as I was in the day that Moses sent mee : as my strength was then , euen so is my strength now , for warre , both to goe out and to come in .
Now therefore giue mee this mountaine , whereof the Lord spake in that day , ( for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there , and that the cities were great and fenced ) if so be the Lord will be with me , then I shall bee able to driue them out , as the Lord said .
And Ioshua blessed him , and gaue vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , Hebron for an inheritance . Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite vnto this day : because that hee wholly followed the Lord God of Israel .

This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Iudah by their families , euen to the border of Edom ; the wildernesse of Zin Southward , was the vttermost part of the South coast :
And their South border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh Southward .
And it went out to the Southside to Maalehacrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended vp on the Southside vnto Kadesh - Barnea : and passed along to Hezron , and went vp to Adar , and fetched a compasse to Karkaa .
From thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out vnto the riuer of Egypt , and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shalbe your South coast .
And the East border was the salt Sea , euen vnto the end of Iordan : and their border in the North quarter , was from the bay of the sea , at the vttermost part of Iordan .
And the border went vp to Bethhogla , and passed along by the North of Beth - arabah , and the border went vp to the stone of Bohan the sonne of Reuben .
And the border went vp toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so Northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going vp to Adummim , which is on the Southside of the riuer : and the border passed towards the waters of Enshemesh , and the goings out thereof were at En - Rogel .
And the border went vp by the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , vnto the South side of the Iebusite , the same is Ierusalem : and the border went vp to the top of the mountaine , that lieth before the valley of Hinnom , Westward , which is at the end of the valley of the giants , Northward .
And the border was drawen from the top of the hill vnto the fountaine of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron , and the border was drawen to Baalah , which is Kiriath - iearim .
And the border compassed from Baalah Westward vnto mount Seir , and passed along vnto the side of mount Iearim , ( which is Chesalon ) on the North side , and went downe to Bethshemesh , and passed on to Timnah .
And the border went out vnto the side of Ekron Northward : and the border was drawen to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out vnto Iabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
And the West border was to the great sea , and the coast therof : this is the coast of the children of Iudah round about , according to their families .
¶ And vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , he gaue a part among the children of Iudah , according to the commandement of the Lord to Ioshua , euen the citie of Arba the father of Anak , which citie is Hebron .
And Caleb droue thence the three sonnes of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
And he went vp thence to the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kiriath - Sepher .
¶ And Caleb said , He that smiteth Kiriath - Sepher , and taketh it , to him will I giue Achsah my daughter to wife .
And Othniel the sonne of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , tooke it : and hee gaue him Achsah his daughter to wife .
And it came to passe as shee came vnto him , that she moued him to aske of her father a field , and she lighted off her asse ; and Caleb said vnto her , What wouldest thou ?
Who answered , Giue mee a blessing ; for thou hast giuen mee a Southland , giue me also springs of water ; and he gaue her the vpper springs , and the nether springs .
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Iudah according to their families .
And the vttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Iudah toward the coast of Edom Southward , were Kabzeel , and Eder , and Iagur , And Kinah , and Dimonah , and Adadah ,
And Kedesh , and Hazor , and Ithnan , Ziph , and Telem , and Bealoth ,

And the lot of the children of Ioseph fell from Iordan by Iericho , vnto the water of Iericho on the East , to the wildernesse that goeth vp from Iericho throughout mount Bethel ;
And goeth out from Bethel to Luz , and passeth along vnto the borders of Archi , to Ataroth ,
And goeth downe Westward , to the coast of Iaphleti , vnto the coast of Bethoron the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the Sea .
So the children of Ioseph , Manasseh , and Ephraim , tooke their inheritance .
¶ And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families , was thus : euen the border of their inheritance on the East side was Ataroth - Addar , vnto Bethoron the vpper .
And the border went out toward the Sea , to Michmethah on the Northside , and the border went about Eastward vnto Taanath Shiloh , and passed by it on the East to Ianohah :
And it went downe from Ianohah to Ataroth and to Naarath , and came to Iericho , and went out at Iordane .
The border went out from Tappuah Westward vnto the riuer Kanah : and the goings out thereof were at the Sea . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
<NON-VERSE>
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; ( for hee was the first borne of Ioseph ) to wit , for Machir the first borne of Manasseh the father of Gilead : because he was a man of warre , therefore hee had Gilead and Bashan .
There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families ; for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh , the sonne of Ioseph by their families .
¶ But Zelophehad the sonne of Hepher , the sonne of Gilead , the sonne of Machir , the sonne of Manasseh , had no sonnes but daughters : And these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
And they came neere before Eleazar the Priest , and before Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and before the Princes , saying , The Lord commanded Moses to giue vs an inheritance among our brethren : therefore according to the commaundement of the Lord , hee gaue them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
And there fel ten portions to Manasseh , beside the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side Iordan ;
Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sonnes : and the rest of Manassehs sonnes had the land of Gilead .
¶ And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem , and the border went along on the right hand , vnto the inhabitants of Entappuah .
Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah : but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim . And the coast descended vnto the riuer Kanah , Southward of the riuer : these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh : the coast of Manasseh also was on the North side of the riuer , and the outgoings of it were at the Sea .
Southward it was Ephraims , and Northward it was Manassehs , and the sea is his border , and they met together in Asher on the North , and in Issachar on the East .
Yet it came to passe when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute : but did not vtterly driue them out .
And the children of Ioseph spake vnto Ioshua , saying , Why hast thou giuen me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto ?
And Ioshua answered them , If thou be a great people , then get thee vp to the wood countrey , and cut downe for thy selfe there in the land of the Perizzites , and of the giants , if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee .
And the children of Ioseph saide , The hill is not enough for vs : and all the Canaanites that dwell in the lande of the valley , haue charets of yron , both they who are of Bethshean and her townes , and they who are of the valley of Iezreel .
And Ioshua spake vnto the house of Ioseph , euen to Ephraim , and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : Thou shalt not haue one lot onely .

And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh , & set vp the Tabernacle of the Congregation there , and the land was subdued before them .
And there remained among the children of Israel seuen tribes , which had not yet receiued their inheritance .
And Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel , how long are you slacke to goe to possesse the lande which the Lord God of your fathers hath giuen you ?
Giue out from among you three men , for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , & goe through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them , and they shal come againe to me .
And they shall diuide it into seuen parts : Iudah shall abide in their coast on the South , and the house of Ioseph shall abide in their coasts on the North .
Ye shall therfore describe the land into seuen parts , and bring the description hither to me : that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
But the Leuites haue no part among you , for the Priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance : and Gad and Reuben , and halfe the tribe of Manasseh , haue receiued their inheritance beyond Iordan on the East , which Moses the seruant of the Lord gaue them .
¶ And the men arose , and went away : and Ioshua charged them that went to describe the land , saying , Goe , and walke through the land , & describe it , and come againe to me , that I may here cast lots for you , before the Lord in Shiloh .
And the men went , and passed thorow the land , and described it by cities , into seuen parts in a booke , and came againe to Ioshua to the hoste at Shiloh .
¶ And Ioshua cast lots for them in Shiloh , before the Lord : and there Ioshua diuided the land vnto the children of Israel according to their diuisions .
¶ And the lot of the tribe of the children of Beniamin came vp according to their families : and the coast of their lot came foorth betweene the children of Iudah , and the children of Ioseph .
And their border on the Northside was from Iordan , and the border went vp to the side of Iericho , on the North side , and went vp through the mountaines Westward , and the goings out thereof were at the wildernesse of Beth - auen .
And the border went ouer from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , ( which is Bethel ) Southward , and the border descended to Ataroth - Adar , neere the hill that lieth on the South side of the nether Beth - horon .
And the border was drawen thence , and compassed the corner of the Sea Southward , from the hill that lieth before Beth - horon Southward : and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath - baal ( which is Kiriath - iearim ) a city of the children of Iudah : This was the West quarter .
And the South quarter was from the end of Kiriath - iearim , & the border went out on the West , and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah .
And the border came downe to the end of the mountaine , that lieth before the valley of the sonne of Hinnom , and which is in the valley of the Giants on the North , and descended to the valley of Hinnom to the side of Iebusi on the South , and descended to En - Rogel ,

Out of the portion of the children of Iudah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Iudah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .

And from thence passeth on along on the East to Gittah - Hepher , to Ittah - Kazin , and goeth out to Remmon Methoar to Neah .
And the border compasseth it on the North side to Hannathon : and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Iiphthah - el .
And Kattath , and Nahallal , and Shimron , and Idalah , and Bethlehem : twelue cities with their villages .

Ummah also , and Aphek , and Rehob : twentie and two cities with their villages .
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
¶ The sixt lot came out to the children of Naphtali : euen for the children of Naphtali according to their families .
And their coast was from Heleph , from Allon to Zaanannim , and Adami , Nekeb , and Iabneel vnto Lakum : and the outgoings thereof were at Iordan .

And Iehud , and Bene - berak , and Gath - rimmon ,
And Meiarkon , and Rakkon , with the border before Iapho .
And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them : therefore the children of Dan went vp to fight against Leshem , and tooke it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and possessed it , and dwelt therein , and called Leshem , Dan , after the name of Dan their father .
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .

According to the word of the Lord , they gaue him the citie which he asked , euen Timnath - Serah in mount Ephraim : and he built the citie , and dwelt therein .

The Lord also spake vnto Ioshua , saying ,
Speake to the children of Israel , saying , Appoint out for you cities of refuge , whereof I spake vnto you by the hand of Moses :
That the slayer that killeth any person vnawares and vnwittingly , may flee thither : and they shall be your refuge from the auenger of blood .
And when he that doeth flee vnto one of those cities , shall stand at the entring of the gate of the city , and shall declare his cause in the eares of the Elders of that citie ; they shall take him into the citie vnto them , and giue him a place , that he may dwell among them .
And if the auenger of blood pursue after him , then they shal not deliuer the slayer vp into his hand : because hee smote his neighbour vnwittingly , and hated him not beforetime .
And hee shall dwell in that citie , vntill he stand before the Congregation for iudgement , and vntill the death of the high Priest that shall bee in those dayes : then shall the slayer returne , and come vnto his owne city , and vnto his owne house , vnto the citie from whence he fled .
¶ And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee , in mount Naphtali , and Shechem in mount Ephraim , and Kiriath - arba ( which is Hebron ) in the mountaine of Iudah .
And on the other side Iordan by Iericho Eastward , they assigned Bezer in the wildernesse vpon the plaine , out of the tribe of Reuben , and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh .
<NON-VERSE> Then came neere the heads of the fathers of the Leuites vnto Eleazar the Priest , and vnto Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and vnto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel .
And they spake vnto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , The Lord commaunded by the hand of Moses , to giue vs Cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattell .
And the children of Israel gaue vnto the Leuites out of their inheritance at the commandement of the Lord , these cities and their suburbs .
And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites : and the children of Aaron the Priest , which were of the Leuites , had by lot out of the tribe of Iudah , and out of the tribe of Simeon , and out of the tribe of Beniamin , thirteene cities .
And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot , out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the halfe tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
And the children of Israel gaue by lot vnto the Leuites these cities with their suburbs , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses . ¶ And they gaue out of the tribe of the children of Iudah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
But the fields of the citie , and the villages thereof , gaue they to Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , for his possession . ¶ Thus they gaue to the children of Aaron the Priest Hebron with her suburbs to bee a citie of refuge for the slayer , and Libnah with her suburbs ,
And Iattir with her suburbs , and Eshtemoa with her suburbs : And Holon with her suburbs , and Debir with her suburbs :

Anathoth with her suburbs , and Almon with her suburbs , foure cities .
All the cities of the children of Aaron the Priests , were thirteene cities with their suburbs .
¶ And the families of the children of Kohath the Leuites , which remained of the children of Kohath , euen they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim . For they gaue them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim , to be a citie of refuge for the slayer : and Gezer with her suburbs ,
And out of the halfe tribe of Manasseh , Tanach with her suburbs , and Gathrimmon with her suburbs , two cities .
All the cities were ten with their suburbs , for the families of the children of Kohath that remained .
¶ And vnto the children of Gershon of the families of the Leuites , out of the other halfe tribe of Manasseh , they gaue Golan in Bashan , with her suburbs , to be a citie of refuge for the slayer : and Beeshterah with her suburbs , two cities .

All the cities of the Leuites within the possession of the children of Israel , were fourty and eight cities , with their suburbs .
These cities were euery one with their suburbs round about them : thus were all these cities .
¶ And the Lord gaue vnto Israel all the land which hee sware to giue vnto their fathers : and they possessed it , and dwelt therein .
And the Lord gaue them rest round about , according to all that he sware vnto their fathers , and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them : the Lord deliuered all their enemies into their hand .

Then Ioshua called the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the halfe tribe of Manasseh ,
And said vnto them , Yee haue kept all that Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded you , and haue obeyed my voyce in all that I commanded you .
Yee haue not left your brethren these many dayes vnto this day , but haue kept the charge of the commandement of the Lord your God .
And now the Lord your God hath giuen rest vnto your brethren , as hee promised them : therefore now returne yee , and get yee vnto your tents , and vnto the land of your possession , which Moses the seruant of the Lord gaue you on the other side Iordane .
But take diligent heed , to doe the Commandement and the Law , which Moses the seruant of the Lord charged you , to loue the Lord your God , and to walke in all his wayes , and to keepe his Commaundements , and to cleaue vnto him , and to serue him with all your heart , and with all your soule .
So Ioshua blessed them , and sent them away : and they went vnto their tents .
¶ Now to the one halfe of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had giuen possession in Bashan : but vnto the other halfe therof gaue Ioshua among their brethren on this side Iordane Westward . And when Ioshua sent them away also vnto their tents , then hee blessed them ,
And he spake vnto them , saying ; Returne with much riches vnto your tents , and with very much cattell , with siluer and with gold , and with brasse , and with iron , and with very much raiment : Diuide the spoile of your enemies with your brethren .
¶ And the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the halfe tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan , to goe vnto the countrey of Gilead , to the land of their possession , whereof they were possessed , according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses . ¶ And when they came vnto the borders of Iordan , that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the halfe tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Iordan , a great altar to see to .
¶ And the children of Israel heard say , Behold , the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the halfe tribe of Manasseh , haue built an altar ouer against the land of Canaan , in the borders of Iordan , at the passage of the children of Israel . And when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselues together at Shiloh , to goe vp to warre against them .
And the children of Israel sent vnto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh into the lande of Gilead , Phinehas son of Eleazar the Priest ,
And with him ten princes , of ech chiefe house a prince , throughout all the tribes of Israel , and each one was an head of the house of their fathers , among the thousands of Israel .
¶ And they came vnto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh vnto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
Thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord , What trespasse is this that ye haue committed against the God of Israel , to turne away this day from following the Lord , in that ye haue builded you an altar , that yee might rebell this day against the Lord ? Is the iniquitie of Peor too litle for vs , from which we are not cleansed vntil this day , ( although there was a plague in the Congregation of the Lord )
But that ye must turne away this day from following the Lord ? And it will be , seeing yee rebell to day against the Lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole Congregation of Israel .
Notwithstanding , if the lande of your possession be vncleane , then passe yee ouer vnto the land of the possession of the Lord , wherein the Lords Tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession among vs : but rebell not against the Lord , nor rebell against vs , in building you an altar , beside the Altar of the Lord our God .
Did not Achan the sonne of Zerah commit a trespasse in the accursed thing , and wrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel ? and that man perished not alone in his iniquitie .
¶ Then the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the halfe tribe of Manasseh , answered and saide vnto the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
The Lord God of gods , the Lord God of gods , hee knoweth , and Israel he shall know ; if it bee in rebellion , or if in transgression against the Lord , ( saue vs not this day , )
That wee haue built vs an altar to turne from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering , or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the Lord himselfe require it ;
And if we haue not rather done it for feare of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speake vnto our children , saying , What haue you to doe with the Lord God of Israel ?
For the Lord hath made Iordan a border betweene vs and you , yee children of Reuben , and children of Gad , yee haue no part in the Lord : so shal your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord :
Therefore we said , Let vs now prepare to build vs an altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice , But that it may bee a witnesse betweene vs and you , and our generations after vs , that we might do the seruice of the Lord before him with our burnt offrings , and with our sacrifices , and with our peace offerings , that your children may not say to our children in time to come , Ye haue no part in the Lord .
Therefore said we , that it shalbe , when they should so say to vs , or to our generations in time to come , that wee may say againe , Beholde the paterne of the altar of the Lord , which our fathers made , not for burnt offrings , nor for sacrifices , but it is a witnes betweene vs and you .
God forbid that we should rebell against the Lord , and turne this day from following the Lord , to build an altar for burnt offerings , for meate offerings , or for sacrifices , besides the Altar of the Lord our God that is before his Tabernacle . ¶ And when Phinehas the Priest and the Princes of the Congregation , and Heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad , and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest said vnto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the children of Manasseh , This day we perceiue that the Lord is among vs , because ye haue not committed this trespasse against the Lord : now ye haue deliuered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord .
¶ And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest , and the Princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , vnto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , & brought them word againe .
And the thing pleased the children of Israel , and the children of Israel blessed God , and did not intend to goe vp against them in battel , to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt .
<NON-VERSE> And it came to passe , a long time after that the Lord had giuen rest vnto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Ioshua waxed old , and stricken in age .
And Ioshua called for all Israel , and for their Elders , & for their Heads , and for their Iudges , and for their Officers , and said vnto them ; I am old , and stricken in age .
And yee haue seene all that the Lord your God hath done vnto all these nations , because of you ; for the Lord your God is hee that hath fought for you .
Behold , I haue diuided vnto you by lot these nations that remaine , to bee an inheritance for your tribes , from Iordan , with all the nations that I haue cut off , euen vnto the great Sea Westward .
And the Lord your God , hee shall expell them from before you , and driue them from out of your sight , & ye shall possesse their land , as the Lord your God hath promised vnto you .
Be ye therefore very courageous to keepe and to doe all that is written in the booke of the Law of Moses , that yee turne not aside therefrom , to the right hand , or to the left ,
That yee come not among these nations , these that remaine amongst you , neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to sweare by them , neither serue them , nor bow your selues vnto them .
But cleaue vnto the Lord your God , as yee haue done vnto this day .
For the Lord hath driuen out from before you , great nations , and strong : But as for you , no man hath beene able to stand before you vnto this day .
One man of you shall chase a thousand : for the Lord your God , he it is that fighteth for you , as hee hath promised you .
Take good heed therefore vnto your selues , that ye loue the Lord your God . Else , if ye do in any wise go backe , and cleaue vnto the remnant of these nations , euen these that remaine among you , and shall make marriages with them , and goe in vnto them , and they to you :
Know for a certainety , that the Lord your God will no more driue out any of these nations from before you : but they shalbe snares and traps vnto you , and scourges in your sides , and thornes in your eyes , vntill yee perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath giuen you .
And behold , this day I am going the way of all the earth , and ye know in all your hearts , and in all your soules , that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning you ; all are come to passe vnto you , and not one thing hath failed thereof . Therefore it shall come to passe , that as all good things are come vpon you , which the Lord your God promised you : so shall the Lord bring vpon you all euill things , vntill he haue destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath giuen you .

And Ioshua gathered all the Tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the Elders of Israel , and for their Heads , and for their Iudges , and for their Officers , and they presented themselues before God .
And Ioshua said vnto all the people , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time , euen Terah the father of Abraham , and the father of Nachor : and they serued other gods .
And I tooke your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gaue him Isaac .
And I gaue vnto Isaac , Iacob and Esau : & I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir , to possesse it : but Iacob and his children went downe into Egypt .
I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did amongst them : and afterward , I brought you out .
And I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and you came vnto the sea , and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with charets and horsemen vnto the red sea .
And when they cried vnto the Lord , hee put darkenesse betweene you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea vpon them , and couered them , and your eyes haue seene what I haue done in Egypt , and ye dwelt in the wildernes a long season .
And I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Iordan : and they fought with you , and I gaue them into your hand , that ye might possesse their land , and I destroyed them from before you .
Then Balak the sonne of Zippor king of Moab , arose and warred against Israel , and sent and called Balaam the sonne of Beor to curse you :
But I would not hearken vnto Balaam , therefore he blessed you still : so I deliuered you out of his hand .
And ye went ouer Iordan , and came vnto Iericho : and the men of Iericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , & the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hiuites , and the Iebusites , and I deliuered them into your hand .
And I sent the hornet before you , which draue them out from before you , euen the two kings of the Amorites : but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
And I haue giuen you a land for which ye did not labour , & cities which ye built not , and yee dwell in them : of the vineyards and Oliue - yards which ye planted not , doe ye eate .
¶ Now therefore , feare the Lord , and serue him in sinceritie , and in trueth , and put away the gods which your fathers serued on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt : and serue yee the Lord .
And if it seeme euill vnto you to serue the Lord , choose you this day whome you will serue , whether the gods which your fathers serued that were on the other side of the flood , or the gods of the Amorites , in whose lande ye dwell : but as for mee and my house , we will serue the Lord .
And the people answered and said , God forbid that wee should forsake the Lord , to serue other gods .
For the Lord our God , he it is that brought vs vp and our fathers out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage , & which did those great signes in our sight , and preserued vs in all the way wherein we went , and among all the people through whom we passed .
And the Lord draue out from before vs all the people , euen the Amorites which dwelt in the land : therefore will we also serue the Lord , for he is our God .
And Ioshua said vnto the people , Ye cannot serue the Lord : for hee is an holy God : he is a ielous God , he will not forgiue your transgressions nor your sinnes .
If yee forsake the Lord , and serue strange gods , then he will turne , and doe you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
And the people said vnto Ioshua , Nay , but we will serue the Lord .
And Ioshua said vnto the people , Yee are witnesses against your selues , that yee haue chosen you the Lord , to serue him . And they said , We are witnesses .
Now therefore put away , said he , the strange gods which are among you , and encline your heart vnto the Lord God of Israel .
And the people saide vnto Ioshua ; The Lord our God will we serue , and his voice will we obey .
So Ioshua made a couenant with the people that day , and set them a Statute , & an Ordinance in Shechem .
¶ And Ioshua wrote these words in the booke of the Law of God , and tooke a great stone , and set it vp there , vnder an oake , that was by the Sanctuary of the Lord .
And Ioshua saide vnto all the people , Behold , this stone shalbe a witnesse vnto vs ; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which hee spake vnto vs ; it shall be there for a witnesse vnto you , lest ye deny your God .
So Ioshua let the people depart , euery man vnto his inheritance .
¶ And it came to passe after these things , that Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of the Lord died , being an hundred and ten yeeres old .
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath - Serah , which is in mount Ephraim , on the North side of the hill of Gaash .
And Israel serued the Lord all the dayes of Ioshua , & all the dayes of the Elders that ouerliued Ioshua , and which had knowen al the works of the Lord , that he had done for Israel .
¶ And the bones of Ioseph , which the children of Israel brought vp out of Egypt , buried they in Shechem , in a parcell of ground which Iacob bought of the sonnes of Hamor the father of Shechem , for an hundred pieces of siluer ; and it became the inheritance of the children of Ioseph .

Iude the seruant of Iesus Christ , and brother of Iames , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserued in Iesus Christ , & called :
Mercie vnto you , and peace , and loue be multiplied .
Beloued , when I gaue all diligence to write vnto you of the common saluation : it was needfull for mee to write vnto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once deliuered vnto the Saints .
For there are certaine men crept in vnawares , who were before of olde ordained to this condemnation , vngodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciuiousnesse , and denying the onely Lord God , & our Lord Iesus Christ .
I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord hauing saued the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroied them that beleeued not .
And the Angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserued in euerlasting chaines vnder darkenesse , vnto the iudgement of the great day .
Euen as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them , in like maner giuing themselues ouer to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffring the vengeance of eternall fire .
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speake euill of dignities .
Yet Michael the Archangel , when contending with the deuill , he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
But these speake euill of those things , which they know not : but what they knowe naturally , as brute beastes , in those things they corrupt themselues .
Wo vnto them , for they haue gone in the way of Kain , and ranne greedily after the errour of Balaam , for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
These are spottes in your feasts of charitie , when they feast with you , feeding themselues without feare : cloudes they are without water , caried about of winds , trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twise dead , plucked vp by the rootes .
Raging waues of the sea , foming out their owne shame , wandring stars , to whom is reserued the blacknesse of darkenesse for euer .
And Enoch also , the seuenth from Adam , prophesied of these , saying , Behold , the Lord commeth with ten thousands of his Saints ,
To execute iudgement vpon all , and to conuince all that are vngodly among them , of all their vngodly deeds which they haue vngodly committed , and of all their heard speaches , which vngodly sinners haue spoken against him .
These are murmurers complainers , walking after their owne lustes , and their mouth speaketh great swelling wordes , hauing mens persons in admiration because of aduantage .
But beloued , remember yee the words , which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ :
How that they tolde you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walke after their own vngodly lustes .
These be they who separate themselues , sensual , hauing not the spirit .
But yee beloued , building vp your selues on your most holy faith , praying in the holy Ghost ,
Keepe your selues in the loue of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ vnto eternall life . And of some haue compassion , making a difference :
And others saue with feare , pulling them out of the fire : hating euen the garment spotted by the flesh . Now vnto him that is able to keepe you from falling , and to present you faultlesse before the presence of his glory with exceeding ioy ,

Now after the death of Ioshua , it came to passe , that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying , Who shal goe vp for vs against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
And the Lord sayd , Iudah shall goe vp : Behold , I haue deliuered the land into his hand .
And Iudah saide vnto Simeon his brother , Come vp with me into my lot , that wee may fight against the Canaanites , and I likewise will goe with thee into thy lot . So Simeon went with him .
And Iudah went vp , and the Lord deliuered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand : and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
And they found Adoni - bezek in Bezek : and they fought against him , and they slew the Canaanites , and the Perizzites .
But Adoni - bezek fled , and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbes , and his great toes .
And Adoni - bezek said , Threescore & ten kings , hauing their thumbs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meate vnder my table : as I haue done , so God hath requited mee , and they brought him to Ierusalem , and there he died .
( Now the children of Iudah had fought against Ierusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the citie on fire )
¶ And afterward the children of Iudah went downe to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the mountaine , & in the South , and in the valley .
And Iudah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron ( nowe the name of Hebron before was Kiriath - arba ) and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir , ( & the name of Debir before was Kiriath - sepher )
And Caleb said , Hee that smiteth Kiriath - sepher , and taketh it , to him will I giue Achsah my daughter to wife .
And Othniel the sonne of Kenaz Calebs yonger brother tooke it : and he gaue him Achsah his daughter to wife .
And it came to passe when shee came to him , that she moued him to aske of her father a field : and shee lighted from off her asse , and Caleb said vnto her , What wilt thou ?
And she said vnto him , Giue me a blessing : for thou hast giuen mee a South land , giue me also springs of water . And Caleb gaue her the vpper springs , and the nether springs .
¶ And the children of the Kenite , Moses father in law , went vp out of the citie of palme trees , with the children of Iudah into the wildernesse of Iudah , which lieth in the South of Arad , and they went and dwelt among the people .
And Iudah went with Simeon his brother , and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath , and vtterly destroyed it , ( and the name of the citie was called Hormah . )
Also Iudah tooke Gaza with the coast thereof , and Askelon with the coast thereof , and Ekron with the coast thereof .
And the Lord was with Iudah , and hee draue out the inhabitants of the mountaine , but could not driue out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had charets of yron .
And they gaue Hebron vnto Caleb , as Moses saide : and hee expelled thence the three sonnes of Anak .
And the house of Ioseph sent to descrie Bethel ( now the name of the citie before was Luz )
And the spies sawe a man come forth out of the citie , and they said vnto him , Shew vs , wee pray thee , the entrance into the citie , and we will shew thee mercie .
And when hee shewed them the entrance into the citie , they smote the citie with the edge of the sword : but they let goe the man and all his familie .
And the man went into the lande of the Hittites , and built a citie , and called the name thereof Luz : which is the name thereof vnto this day .
¶ Neither did Manasseh driue out the inhabitants of Bethshean , and her townes , nor Taanach and her townes , nor the inhabitants of Dor , and her townes , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam , and her townes , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo , and her townes : but the Canaanites would dwel in that land .
And it came to passe when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not vtterly driue them out .
¶ Neither did Ephraim driue out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer : but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them .
¶ Neither did Zebulun driue out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol : but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
¶ Neither did Asher driue out the inhabitants of Accho , nor the inhabitants of Zidon , nor of Ahlab , nor Achzib , nor Helbath , nor Aphik , nor of Rehob :
But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not driue them out .
¶ Neither did Naphtali driue out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh , nor the inhabitants of Bethanath , but hee dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : neuerthelesse , the inhabitants of Bethshemesh , and of Bethanath , became tributaries vnto them .
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountaine : for they would not suffer them to come downe to the valley .
But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aiialon , & in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Ioseph preuailed , so that they became tributaries .

And an Angel of the Lord came vp from Gilgal to Bochim , and said , I made you to goe vp out of Egypt , and haue brought you vnto the land which I sware vnto your fathers , and I said , I will neuer breake my Couenant with you .
And yee shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land , you shal throw downe their altars : But ye haue not obeyed my voyce ; Why haue ye done this ?
Wherefore I also said , I will not driue them out from before you : but they shalbe as thornes in your sides , and their gods shalbe a snare vnto you .
And it came to passe when the Angel of the Lord spake these words vnto all the children of Israel , that the people lift vp their voice , and wept .
And they called the name of that place Bochim : and they sacrificed there vnto the Lord .
¶ And when Ioshua had let the people goe , the children of Israel went euery man vnto his inheritance , to possesse the land .
And the people serued the Lord all the dayes of Ioshua , and all the dayes of the Elders that outliued Ioshua , who had seene all the great workes of the Lord , that hee did for Israel .
And Ioshua the sonne of Nun , the seruant of the Lord died , being an hundred and ten yeeres old .
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath - Heres , in the mount of Ephraim , on the North side of the hill Gaash .
And also all that generation were gathered vnto their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , which knew not the Lord , nor yet the woorkes which hee had done for Israel .
¶ And the children of Israel did euil in the sight of the Lord , and serued Baalim :
And they forsooke the Lord God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselues vnto them , and prouoked the Lord to anger .
And they forsooke the Lord , and serued Baal and Ashtaroth .
¶ And the anger of the Lord was hote against Israel , and he deliuered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
Whither soeuer they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for euill , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworne vnto them : and they were greatly distressed .
¶ Neuerthelesse , the Lord raysed vp Iudges , which deliuered them out of the hand of those that spoyled them .
And yet they would not hearken vnto their Iudges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselues vnto them : they turned quickly out of the way , which their fathers walked in , obeying the Commandements of the Lord ; but they did not so .
And when the Lord raised them vp Iudges , then the Lord was with the Iudge , and deliuered them out of the hand of their enemies , all the dayes of the Iudge ( for it repented the Lord , because of their gronings by reason of them that oppressed them , and vexed them : )
And it came to passe when the Iudge was dead , that they returned , and corrupted themselues more then their fathers , in following other gods , to serue them , and to bow downe vnto them : they ceased not from their owne doings , nor from their stubborne way .
¶ And the anger of the Lord was hote against Israel , and he said , Because that this people hath transgressed my Couenant which I commanded their fathers , and haue not hearkened vnto my voice :
I also will not henceforth driue out any from before them of the nations which Ioshua left when he died : That through them I may proue Israel , whether they will keepe the way of the Lord , to walke therein , as their fathers did keepe it , or not .
<NON-VERSE> Now these are the nations which the Lord left , to prooue Israel by them , ( euen as many of Israel as had not knowen all the warres of Canaan ;
Onely that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them warre , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof : )
Namely fiue lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hiuites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal - Hermon , vnto the entring in of Hamath .
And they were to prooue Israel by them , to know whether they would hearken vnto the Commandements of the Lord , which hee commaunded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
¶ And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hiuites , and Iebusites ,
And they tooke their daughters to be their wiues , and gaue their daughters to their sonnes , and serued their gods .
And the children of Israel did euill in the sight of the Lord , and forgate the Lord their God , and serued Baalim , and the groues .
¶ Therefore the anger of the Lord was hote against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Chushan - Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel serued Chushan - Rishathaim eight yeeres .
And when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord , the Lord raised vp a deliuerer to the children of Israel , who deliuered them , euen Othniel the sonne of Kenaz , Calebs yonger brother .
And the Spirit of the Lord came vpon him , and he iudged Israel , and went out to warre , & the Lord deliuered Chushan - Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand preuailed against Chushan - Rishathaim .
And the land had rest forty yeres : and Othniel the sonne of Kenaz died .
¶ And the children of Israel did euill againe in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done euill in the sight of the Lord .
But when the children of Israel cried vnto the Lord , the Lord raised them vp a deliuerer , Ehud the sonne of Gera , a Beniamite , a man left handed : and by him the children of Israel sent a Present vnto Eglon the king of Moab .
But Ehud made him a dagger ( which had two edges ) of a cubite length , and he did gird it vnder his raiment , vpon his right thigh ,
And he brought the present vnto Eglon king of Moab : and Eglon was a very fat man . And when he had made an end to offer the Present , he sent away the people that bare the Present .
But hee himselfe turned againe from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I haue a secret errand vnto thee , O king : who said , Keepe silence . And all that stood by him , went out from him .
And Ehud came vnto him , and he was sitting in a Summer parlour , which hee had for himselfe alone : And Ehud said , I haue a message from God vnto thee . And he arose out of his seat .
And Ehud put forth his left hand , and tooke the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly .
And the haft also went in after the blade : and the fatte closed vpon the blade , so that hee could not drawe the dagger out of his belly , and the dirt came out .
Then Ehud went forth through the porche , and shut the doores of the parlour vpon him , and locked them .
When he was gone out , his seruants came , and when they saw , that behold , the doores of the parlour were locked , they said , Surely he couereth his feet in his Summer chamber .
And they taried till they were ashamed : and behold , he opened not the doores of the parlour , therefore they tooke a key , and opened them : and behold , their lord was fallen downe dead on the earth .
And Ehud escaped while they taried : and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped vnto Seirath .
And it came to passe when hee was come , that hee blew a trumpet in the mountaine of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went downe with him from the mount , & he before them .
And hee said vnto them , Follow after me : for the Lord hath deliuered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . And they went downe after him , and tooke the foords of Iordan toward Moab , and suffered not a man to passe ouer .
And they slewe of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour , and there escaped not a man .
So Moab was subdued that day vnder the hand of Israel : and the land had rest fourescore yeeres .
<NON-VERSE>
And the children of Israel againe did euil in the sight of the Lord , when Ehud was dead .
And the Lord sold them into the hande of Iabin king of Canaan : that reigned in Hazor , the captaine of whose host was Sisera , which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
And the children of Israel cried vnto the Lord : for he had nine hundred charets of yron : and twentie yeres hee mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
¶ And Deborah a prophetesse , the wife of Lapidoth , shee iudged Israel at that time .
And shee dwelt vnder the palme tree of Deborah , betweene Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim : and the children of Israel came vp to her for iudgement .
And shee sent and called Barak the sonne of Abinoam , out of Kedesh - Naphtali , and said vnto him , Hath not the Lord God of Israel commaunded , saying , Goe , and drawe toward mount Tabor , and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali , and of the children of Zebulun ?
And I wil draw vnto thee to the riuer Kishon , Sisera the captaine of Iabins army , with his charets , and his multitude , and I will deliuer him into thine hand .
And Barak said vnto her , If thou wilt goe with me , then I wil goe : but if thou wilt not goe with mee , then I will not goe .
And she said , I wil surely go with thee , notwithstanding the iourney that thou takest , shal not be for thine honor : for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman . And Deborah arose , & went with Barak to Kedesh .
¶ And Barak called Zebulun , and Naphtali to Kedesh , and he went vp with ten thousand men at his feete : and Deborah went vp with him .
Now Heber the Kenite , which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses , had seuered himselfe from the Kenites , and pitched his tent vnto the plaine of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh .
And they shewed Sisera , that Barak the sonne of Abinoam was gone vp to mount Tabor .
And Sisera gathered together all his charets , euen nine hundred charets of iron , and al the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , vnto the riuer of Kishon .
And Deborah said vnto Barak , Up , for this is the day in which the Lord hath deliuered Sisera into thine hand : Is not the Lord gone out before thee ? so Barak went downe from mount Tabor , and ten thousand men after him .
And the Lord discomfited Sisera , and all his charets , and all his hoste with the edge of the sword , before Barak : so that Sisera lighted downe off his charet , and fled away on his feet .
But Barak pursued after the charets , and after the hoste vnto Harosheth of the Gentiles , and all the host of Sisera fell vpon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet , to the tent of Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace betweene Iabin the king of Hazor , and the house of Heber the Kenite .
¶ And Iael went out to meete Sisera , and said vnto him , Turne in , my lord , turne in to me , feare not . And when hee had turned in vnto her , into the tent , shee couered him with a mantle .
And he said vnto her , Giue me , I pray thee , a litle water to drinke , for I am thirstie . And she opened a bottle of milke , and gaue him drinke , and couered him .
Againe he said vnto her , Stand in the doore of the tent , and it shall bee when any man doeth come and enquire of thee and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No .
Then Iael Hebers wife , tooke a naile of the tent , and tooke an hammer in her hand , and went softly vnto him , and smote the naile into his temples , and fastened it into the ground : ( for he was fast asleepe , and weary ; ) so he died .
And behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Iael came out to meet him , and said vnto him , Come , and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest . And when he came into her tent , behold , Sisera lay dead , and the naile was in his temples . So God subdued on that day , Iabin the king of Canaan , before the children of Israel .

Speake yee that ride on white asses , yee that sit in Iudgement , and walke by the way .

Awake , awake Deborah : awake , awake , vtter a song : arise Barak , and leade thy captiuitie captiue , thou sonne of Abinoam .
Then hee made him that remaineth , haue dominion ouer the Nobles among the people : the Lord made me haue dominion ouer the mightie .
Out of Ephraim was there a roote of them against Amalek , after thee Beniamin , among thy people : Out of Machir came downe gouernours , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah : euen Issachar , and also Barak , he was sent on foot into the valley : for the diuisions of Reuben , there were great thoughts of heart .

Gilead abode beyond Iordan : and why did Dan remaine in ships ? Asher continued on the sea shore , and abode in his breaches .
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that ieoparded their liues vnto the death , in the high places of the field .

They fought from heauen , the starres in their courses fought against Sisera .
The riuer of Kishon swept them away , that ancient riuer , the riuer Kishon : O my soule , thou hast troden downe strength .

<NON-VERSE> And the children of Israel did euill in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord deliuered them into the hande of Midian seuen yeeres .
And the hand of Midian preuailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites , the children of Israel made them the dennes which are in the mountaines , and caues , & strong holds .
And so it was when Israel had sowen , that the Midianites came vp , & the Amalekites , & the children of the East , euen they came vp against them ,
And they encamped against them , and destroyed the encrease of the earth , till thou come vnto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheepe , nor oxe , nor asse .
For they came vp with their cattell and their tents , and they came as Grashoppers for multitude , for both they and their camels were without number : and they entred into the land to destroy it . And Israel was greatly impouerished , because of the Midianites , and the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord .
¶ And it came to passe when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord , because of the Midianites ,
That the Lord sent a Prophet vnto the children of Israel , which said vnto them ; Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I brought you vp from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ,
And I deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of al that oppressed you , and draue them out from before you , and gaue you their land :
And I said vnto you , I am the Lord your God , feare not the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwel : But ye haue not obeyed my voice .
¶ And there came an Angel of the Lord , and sate vnder an Oake which was in Ophrah , that pertained vnto Ioash the Abi - Ezrite : and his sonne Gideon threshed wheat by the winepresse , to hide it from the Midianites .
And the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him , and said vnto him , The Lord is with thee , thou mightie man of valour .
And Gideon said vnto him , Oh my Lord , if the Lord bee with vs , why then is all this befallen vs ? and where be all his miracles which our fathers tolde vs of , saying , Did not the Lord bring vs vp from Egypt ? But now the Lord hath forsaken vs , and deliuered vs into the hands of the Midianites .
And the Lord looked vpon him , and said , Goe in this thy might , and thou shalt saue Israel from the hand of the Midianites : haue not I sent thee ?
And hee said vnto him , Oh my lord , wherewith shall I saue Israel ? behold , my family is poore in Manasseh , and I am the least in my fathers house .
And the Lord said vnto him , Surely I will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the Midianites , as one man .
And he said vnto him , If now I haue found grace in thy sight , then shew me a signe , that thou talkest with me .
Depart not hence , I pray thee , vntil I come vnto thee , and bring forth my Present , and set it before thee . And hee saide , I will tary vntill thou come againe .
¶ And Gideon went in , and made ready a kid , and vnleauened cakes of an Ephah of floure : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out vnto him vnder the oake , and presented it .
And the Angel of God sayd vnto him , Take the flesh , and the vnleauened cakes , and lay them vpon this rocke , and powre out the broth . And he did so .
¶ Then the Angel of the Lord put foorth the end of the staffe that was in his hand , and touched the flesh , and the vnleauened cakes , and there rose vp fire out of the rocke , and consumed the flesh and the vnleauened cakes : then the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight .
And when Gideon perceiued that hee was an Angel of the Lord , Gideon said , Alas , O Lord God : for because I haue seene an Angel of the Lord face to face .
And the Lord said vnto him , Peace be vnto thee , feare not , thou shalt not die .
Then Gideon built an Altar there vnto the Lord , and called it Iehouah shalom : vnto this day it is yet in Ophrah , of the Abi - Ezrites .
¶ And it came to passe the same night , that the Lord said vnto him , Take thy fathers yong bullocke , euen the second bullocke of seuen yeeres old , and throw downe the altar of Baal that thy father hath , and cut downe the groue that is by it :
And builde an Altar vnto the Lord thy God vpon the top of this rocke , in the ordered place , and take the second bullocke , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the groue , which thou shalt cut downe .
Then Gideon tooke ten men of his seruants , and did as the Lord had said vnto him : And so it was because hee feared his fathers houshold , and the men of the city , that he could not doe it by day , that hee did it by night .
¶ And when the men of the citie arose earely in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast downe , and the groue was cut downe that was by it , and the second bullocke was offered vpon the altar that was built .
And they said one to another , Who hath done this thing ? And when they enquired and asked , they said , Gideon the sonne of Ioash hath done this thing .
Then the men of the citie said vnto Ioash , Bring out thy sonne , that he may die : because he hath cast downe the altar of Baal , and because hee hath cut downe the groue that was by it .
And Ioash said vnto all that stood against him , Will ye pleade for Baal ? will ye saue him ? He that will plead for him , let him be put to death whilest it is yet morning : if he be a god , let him plead for himselfe , because one hath cast down his altar .
Therefore on that day hee called him Ierubbaal , saying , Let Baal plead against him , because hee hath throwen downe his altar .
¶ Then all the Midianites , and the Amalekites , and the children of the East were gathered together , and went ouer , and pitched in the valley of Iezreel .
But the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Gideon , and hee blewe a trumpet , and Abiezer was gathered after him .
And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh , who also was gathered after him , and hee sent messengers vnto Asher , and vnto Zebulun , and vnto Naphtali , and they came vp to meete them .
¶ And Gideon said vnto God , If thou wilt saue Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said ,
Beholde , I will put a fleece of wooll in the floore : and if the deaw be on the fleece onely , and it bee drie vpon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt saue Israel by my hande , as thou hast said .
And it was so : for he rose vp early on the morrow , and thrust the fleece together , and wringed the deaw out of the fleece , a bowle full of water .
And Gideon said vnto God , Let not thine anger be hote against me , and I will speake but this once : Let mee prooue , I pray thee , but this once with the fleece . Let it now be drie onely vpon the fleece , and vpon all the ground let there be deaw .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Ierubbaal ( who is Gideon ) and all the people that were with him , rose vp earely , and pitched beside the well of Harod : so that the hoste of the Midianites were on the North side of them by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
And the Lord said vnto Gideon , The people that are with thee , are too many for me to giue the Midianites into their handes , lest Israel vaunt themselues against mee , saying , Mine owne hand hath saued me .
Now therefore go to , proclaime in the eares of the people , saying , Whosoeuer is fearefull and afraid , let him returne and depart earely from mount Gilead : and there returned of the people twentie and two thousand , & there remained ten thousand .
And the Lord said vnto Gideon , The people are yet too many : bring them downe vnto the water , and I wil trie them for thee there : and it shall bee that of whome I say vnto thee , This shall goe with thee , the same shall goe with thee : and of whomsoeuer I say vnto thee , This shal not goe with thee , the same shall not goe .
And the Lord said vnto Gideon , By the three hundred men that lapped , will I saue you , and deliuer the Midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people goe euery man vnto his place .
So the people tooke victuals in their hand , and their trumpets : and he sent all the rest of Israel , euery man vnto his tent , and reteined those three hundred men : and the hoste of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
¶ And it came to passe the same night , that the Lord sayd vnto him , Arise , get thee downe vnto the hoste , for I haue deliuered it into thine hand .
But if thou feare to goe downe , goe thou with Phurah thy seruant downe to the hoste .
And thou shalt heare what they say , and afterward shall thine handes be strengthened to goe downe vnto the hoste . Then went hee downe , with Phurah his seruant , vnto the outside of the armed men , that were in the hoste .
And the Midianites , and the Amalekites , and all the children of the East , lay along in the valley like grashoppers for multitude , and their camels were without number , as the sand by the Sea side for multitude .
And when Gideon was come , beholde , there was a man that tolde a dreame vnto his fellow , and sayd , Behold , I dreamed a dreame , and loe , a cake of Barley bread tumbled into the hoste of Midian , and came vnto a tent , and smote it that it fell , and ouerturned it , that the tent lay along .
And his fellow answered , and said , This is nothing els saue the sword of Gideon the sonne of Ioash , a man of Israel : for into his hand hath God deliuered Midian , and all the hoste .
¶ And it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dreame , and the interpretation thereof , that hee worshipped , and returned into the host of Israel , and sayd , Arise , for the Lord hath deliuered into your hand the host of Midian .
And he diuided the three hundred men into three companies , and hee put a trumpet in euery mans hand , with empty pitchers , and lampes within the pitchers ,
And hee said vnto them , Looke on mee , and doe likewise ; and beholde , when I come to the outside of the campe , it shall be that as I doe , so shall ye doe .
When I blow with a trumpet , I and all that are with mee , then blow ye the trumpets also on euery side of all the campe , and say , The sword of the Lord , and of Gideon .
¶ So Gideon and the hundred men that were with him , came vnto the outside of the campe , in the beginning of the middle watch , and they had but newly set the watch , and they blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers that were in their hands .
And the three companies blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers , and held the lampes in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withall : and they cryed , The sword of the Lord , and of Gideon .
And they stood euery man in his place , round about the campe : and all the host ranne , and cried , and fled .
And the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the Lord set euery mans sword against his fellow , euen throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth - shittah , in Zererath , and to the border of Abel Meholah , vnto Tabbath .
And the men of Israel gathered themselues together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
¶ And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim , saying ; Come downe against the Midianites , and take before them the waters vnto Beth - barah , and Iordan . Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselues together , and tooke the waters vnto Beth - barah , and Iordane .
<NON-VERSE>
And the men of Ephraim said vnto him , Why hast thou serued vs thus , that thou calledst vs not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites ? And they did chide with him sharpely .
And he said vnto them , What haue I done now in comparison of you ? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better then the vintage of Abiezer ?
God hath deliuered into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb : and what was I able to doe in comparison of you ? then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
¶ And Gideon came to Iordan , and passed ouer , hee , and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing them .
And he said vnto the men of Succoth , Giue , I pray you , loaues of bread vnto the people that follow me , for they bee faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian .
¶ And the princes of Succoth said , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hands , that wee should giue bread vnto thine armie ?
And Gideon said , Therfore when the Lord hath deliuered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand , then I wil teare your flesh with the thornes of the wildernesse , and with briers .
¶ And he went vp thence to Penuel , and spake vnto them likewise : and the men of Penuel answered him , as the men of Succoth had answered him .
And he spake also vnto the men of Penuel , saying , When I come againe in peace , I will breake downe this towre .
¶ Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hostes with them , about fifteene thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the East : for there fell an hundred and twentie thousand men that drew sword .
¶ And Gideon went vp by the way of them that dwelt in tents , on the East of Nobah , and Iogbehah , and smote the host : for the host was secure .
And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled , he pursued after them , and took the two kings of Midian , Zebah , and Zalmunna , & discomfited all the host .
¶ And Gideon the sonne of Ioash returned from battel before the Sunne was vp ,
And caught a yong man of the men of Succoth , and enquired of him : and he described vnto him the princes of Succoth and the elders thereof , euen threescore and seuenteene men .
And he came vnto the men of Succoth , and said , Behold Zebah and Zalmunna , with whom ye did vpbraid me , saying , Are the handes of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should giue bread vnto thy men that are wearie ?
And hee tooke the Elders of the citie , and thornes of the wildernes , and briers , and with them hee taught the men of Succoth .
And he beat downe the towre of Penuel , and slew the men of the citie .
¶ Then said he vnto Zebah and Zalmunna , What maner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor ? And they answered , As thou art , so were they , ech one resembled the children of a king .
And hee said , They were my brethren , euen the sonnes of my mother : as the Lord liueth , if yee had saued them aliue , I would not slay you .
And he said vnto Iether his first borne , Up , and slay them : but the youth drew not his sword : for he feared , because he was yet a youth .
Then Zebah and Zalmunna said , Rise thou , and fall vpon vs : for as the man is , so is his strength . And Gideon arose , and slewe Zebah and Zalmunna , & tooke away the ornaments that were on their camels neckes .
¶ Then the men of Israel saide vnto Gideon , Rule thou ouer vs , both thou , and thy sonne , & thy sonnes sonne also : for thou hast deliuered vs from the hand of Midian .
And Gideon said vnto them , I will not rule ouer you , neither shall my sonne rule ouer you : the Lord shall rule ouer you .
¶ And Gideon said vnto them , I would desire a request of you , that you would giue me euery man the earerings of his pray . For they had golden eare - rings , because they were Ishmaelites .
And they answered , We will willingly giue them . And they spread a garment , and did cast therein , euery man the earerings of his pray .
And the weight of the golden eare - rings that hee requested , was a thousand and seuen hundred shekels of gold , beside ornaments , and collars , & purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian , and beside the chaines that were about their camels necks .
And Gideon made an Ephod thereof , and put it in his citie , euen in Ophrah : and all Israel went thither a whoring after it ; which thing became a snare vnto Gideon , and to his house .
And Gideon had threescore and ten sonnes of his body begotten : for he had many wiues .
And his concubine that was in Shechem , shee also bare him a sonne , whose name he called Abimelech .
¶ And Gideon the sonne of Ioash died , in a good olde age , and was buried in the sepulchre of Ioash his father , in Ophrah of the Abi - Ezrites .
And it came to passe as soone as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned againe , and went a whoring after Baalim , and made Baal - Berith their god .
And the children of Israel remembred not the Lord their God , who had deliuered them out of the hands of all their enemies , on euery side :
<NON-VERSE>
And Abimelech the sonne of Ierubbaal went to Shechem , vnto his mothers brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mothers father , saying ;
Speake , I pray you , in the eares of all the men of Shechem ; Whether is better for you , either that all the sonnes of Ierubbaal ( which are threescore and ten persons ) reigne ouer you , or that one reigne ouer you ? Remember also , that I am your bone , and your flesh .
And his mothers brethren spake of him in the eares of all the men of Shechem , all these wordes , and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech : for they said , He is our brother .
And they gaue him threescore and ten pieces of siluer , out of the house of Baal - Berith , wherewith Abimelech hired vaine & light persons , which followed him .
And hee went vnto his fathers house at Ophrah , and slewe his brethren the sonnes of Ierubbaal , being threescore and tenne persons , vpon one stone : notwithstanding , yet Iotham the youngest sonne of Ierubbaal was left ; for he hid himselfe .
And all the men of Shechem gathered together , and all the house of Millo , and went , and made Abimelech King , by the plaine of the pillar that was in Shechem .
¶ And when they told it to Iotham , he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim , and lift vp his voice , and cried , and said vnto them , Hearken vnto mee , you men of Shechem , that God may hearken vnto you .
The trees went foorth on a time to annoint a King ouer them , and they said vnto the Oliue tree , Reigne thou ouer vs .
But the Oliue tree saide vnto them , Should I leaue my fatnesse , wherewith by mee they honour God and man , and goe to bee promoted ouer the trees ?
And the trees said to the Figge tree , Come thou , and reigne ouer vs .
But the Figge tree saide vnto them , Should I forsake my sweetenesse , and my good fruit , and goe to be promoted ouer the trees ?
Then saide the trees vnto the Uine , Come thou , and reigne ouer vs .
And the Uine said vnto them , Should I leaue my wine , which cheareth God and man , and goe to bee promoted ouer the trees ?
Then said all the trees vnto the Bramble , Come thou , and reigne ouer vs .
And the Bramble said vnto the trees , If in trueth ye anoint me King ouer you , then come , and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the Bramble , and deuoure the Cedars of Lebanon .
Now therefore , if yee haue done truely and sincerely , in that yee haue made Abimelech King , and if yee haue dealt well with Ierubbaal , and his house , and haue done vnto him according to the deseruing of his hands :
( For my father fought for you , and aduentured his life farre , and deliuered you out of the hand of Midian :
And yee are risen vp against my fathers house this day , and haue slaine his sonnes , threescore aud ten persons , vpon one stone , and haue made Abimelech the sonne of his maidseruant , king ouer the men of Shechem , because he is your brother . )
If yee then haue dealt truely and sincerely with Ierubbaal , and with his house this day , then reioyce yee in Abimelech , aud let him also reioyce in you .
But if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and deuoure the men of Shechem and the house of Millo : and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and deuoure Abimeleeh .
And Iotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and dwelt there for feare of Abimeleeh his brother .
¶ When Abimelech had reigned three yeeres ouer Israel ,
Then God sent an euill spirit betweene Abimelech & the men of Shechem : and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
That the crueltie done to the threescore and ten sonnes of Ierubbaal might come , and their blood be laid vpon Abimelech their brother which slew them , and vpon the men of Shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethren .
And the men of Shechem set lyers in wait for him in the toppe of the mountaines , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
And Gaal the sonne of Ebed came with his brethren , and went ouer to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
And they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eate and drinke , and cursed Abimelech .
And Gaal the sonne of Ebed said , Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serue him ? Is not he the sonne of Ierubbaal ? and Zebul his officer ? serue the men of Hamor the father of Shechem : for why should we serue him ?
And would to God this people were vnder my hand ; then would I remoue Abimelech . And he said to Abimelech , Increase thine armie and come out .
¶ And when Zebul the ruler of the citie heard the wordes of Gaal the sonne of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
And he sent messengers vnto Abimelech priuily , saying , Behold , Gaal the sonne of Ebed , and his brethren , be come to Shechem , and behold , they fortifie the citie against thee .
Now therefore vp by night , thou and the people that is with thee , and lie in wait in the field .
And it shalbe , that in the morning assoone as the Sunne is vp , thou shalt rise earely , and set vpon the citie : and behold , when he and the people that is with him , come out against thee , then mayest thou doe to them as thou shalt finde occasion . ¶ And Abimelech rose vp , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in foure companies .
And Gaal the sonne of Ebed went out , and stood in the entring of the gate of the citie : and Abimelech rose vp , and the people that were with him , from lying in waite .
And when Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul , Behold , there come people downe from the top of the mountaines . And Zebul saide vnto him , Thou seest the shadow of the mountaines , as if they were men .
And Gaal spake againe , and said , See , there come people downe by the middle of the land , and another companie come along by the plaine of Meonenim .
Then said Zebul vnto him , Where is now thy mouth , wherwith thou saidst , Who is Abimelech , that wee should serue him ? Is not this the people that thou hast despised ? Goe out , I pray now , and fight with them .
And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem , and fought with Abimelech .
And Abimelech chased him , and hee fledde before him , and many were ouerthrowen and wounded , euen vnto the entring of the gate .
And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah : and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren , that they should not dwell in Shechem .
And it came to passe on the morrow , that the people went out into the field , and they tolde Abimelech .
And he tooke the people , and diuided them into three companies , and laide waite in the field , and looked , and behold , the people were come forth out of the citie , and he rose vp against them , and smote them .
And Abimelech , and the companie that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entring of the gate of the citie : and the two other companies ranne vpon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
And Abimelech fought against the citie all that day , and he tooke the citie , and slewe the people that was therein , and beat downe the citie , and sowed it with salt . ¶ And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that , they entred into an holde of the house of the god Berith .
And it was told Abimelech , that all the men of the towre of Shechem were gathered together . And Abimelech gate him vp to mount Zalmon , hee and all the people that were with him , & Abimelech tooke an axe in his hand , and cut downe a bough from the trees , and tooke it , and laide it on his shoulder , and said vnto the people that were with him , What ye haue seene me doe , make haste , and doe as I haue done .
And all the people likewise cut downe euery man his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them to the holde , and set the holde on fire vpon them : so that all the men of the towre of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
¶ Then went Abimelech to Thebez , and encamped against Thebez , and tooke it .
But there was a strong towre within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the citie , and shut it to them , and gate them vp to the top of the towre .
And Abimelech came vnto the towre , and fought against it , and went hard vnto the doore of the towre , to burne it with fire .
And a certaine woman cast a piece of a milstone vpon Abimelechs head , and all to brake his scull .
Then hee called hastily vnto the young man his armour - bearer , and said vnto him , Draw thy sword , and slay me , that men say not of me , A woman slewe him : and his young man thrust him through , and he died .
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed euery man vnto his place .
¶ Thus God rendred the wickednesse of Abimelech which hee did vnto his father , in slaying his seuentie brethren .
<NON-VERSE>
And after Abimelech , there arose to defend Israel , Tola the sonne of Puah , the sonne of Dodo , a man of Issachar , and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim .
And he iudged Israel twenty and three yeeres , and died , and was buried in Shamir .
¶ And after him arose Iair a Gileadite , and iudged Israel twentie and two yeeres .
And hee had thirtie sonnes that rode on thirtie asse - colts , and they had thirtie cities , which are called Hauoth - Iair vnto this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
And Iair died , and was buried in Camon .
¶ And the children of Israel did euill againe in the sight of the Lord , and serued Baalim and Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Zidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines , and forsooke the Lord , and serued not him .
And the anger of the Lord was hot agaiust Israel , and hee solde them into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hands of the children of Ammon .
And that yere they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel : eighteene yeeres , all the children of Israel that were on the other side Iordan , in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
Moreouer , the children of Ammon passed ouer Iordan , to fight also against Iudah , and against Beniamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was sore distressed .
¶ And the children of Israel cried vnto the Lord , saying , Wee haue sinned against thee , both because wee haue forsaken our God , and also serued Baalim .
And the Lord said vnto the children of Israel , Did not I deliuer you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
The Zidonians also and the Amalekites , and the Maonites did oppresse you , and ye cried to me , and I deliuered you out of their hand .
Yet ye haue forsaken me , and serued other gods : wherefore I will deliuer you no more .
Go , and cry vnto the gods which ye haue chosen , let them deliuer you in the time of your tribulation .
¶ And the children of Israel said vnto the Lord , We haue sinned , doe thou vnto vs whatsoeuer seemeth good vnto thee , deliuer vs onely , wee pray thee , this day .
And they put away the strange gods from among them , and serued the Lord : and his soule was grieued for the misery of Israel .
Then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead : and the children of Israel assembled themselues together , and encamped in Mizpeh .
<NON-VERSE>
Now Iephthah the Gileadite was a mightie man of valour , and he was the sonne of an harlot : and Gilead begate Iephthah .
And Gileads wife bare him sonnes , and his wiues sonnes grew vp , and they thrust out Iephthah , and said vnto him , Thou shalt not inherite in our fathers house , for thou art the son of a strange woman .
Then Iephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vaine men to Iephthah , and went out with him .
¶ And it came to passe , in processe of time , that the children of Ammon made warre against Israel .
And it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the Elders of Gilead went to fetch Iephthah out of the land of Tob ,
And they said vnto Iephthah , Come and bee our Captaine , that wee may fight with the children of Ammon .
And Iephthah said vnto the Elders of Gilead , Did not ye hate me , and expell me out of my fathers house ? And why are ye come vnto mee now when ye are in distresse ?
And the Elders of Gilead said vnto Iephthah , Therefore we turne againe to thee now , that thou mayest go with vs , and fight against the children of Ammon , and bee our head ouer all the inhabitants of Gilead .
And Iephthah said vnto the Elders of Gilead , If ye bring me home againe to fight against the children of Ammon , and the Lord deliuer them before me ; shall I be your Head ?
And the Elders of Gilead said vnto Iephthah , The Lord be witnes betweene vs , if we doe not so according to thy words .
Then Iephthah went with the Elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captaine ouer them : and Iephthah vttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh .
¶ And Iephthah sent messengers vnto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against mee to fight in my land ?
And the king of the children of Ammon answered vnto the messengers of Iephthah ; Because Israel tooke away my land when they came vp out of Egypt , from Arnon euen vnto Iabbok , and vnto Iordan : now therfore restore those lands againe peaceably .
And Iephthah sent messengers againe vnto the king of the children of Ammon :
And said vnto him , Thus saith Iephthah ; Israel tooke not away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon :
But when Israel came vp from Egypt , and walked through the wildernesse , vnto the red sea , and came to Kadesh ;
Then Israel sent messengers vnto the king of Edom saying , Let me , I pray thee , passe through thy land . But the king of Edom would not hearken thereto : And in like maner they sent vnto the king of Moab : but hee would not consent : & Israel abode in Kadesh .
Then they went along through the wildernes , and compassed the land of Edom , and the land of Moab , and came by the Eastside of the land of Moab , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , but came not within the border of Moab : for Arnon was the border of Moab .
And Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon , and Israel said vnto him , Let vs passe , we pray thee , thorow thy land , vnto my place .
But Sihon trusted not Israel , to passe through his coast : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and pitched in Iahaz , and fought against Israel .
And the Lord God of Israel deliuered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smote them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that countrey .
And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites , from Arnon euen vnto Iabbok , and from the wildernesse euen vnto Iordan .
So nowe the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel , and shouldest thou possesse it ?
Wilt not thou possesse that which Chemosh thy god giueth thee to possesse ? so whomsoeuer the Lord our God shal driue out from before vs , them will we possesse .
And now , art thou any thing better then Balak the sonne of Zippor king of Moab ? Did hee euer striue against Israel , or did hee euer fight against them ,
While Israel dwelt in Heshbon , and her townes , and in Aroer , and her townes , and in all the cities that bee along by the coasts of Arnon , three hundred yeeres ? Why therefore did yee not recouer them within that time ?
Wherefore , I haue not sinned against thee , but thou doest me wrong to warre against mee : the Lord the Iudge , bee Iudge this day betweene the children of Israel , and the children of Ammon .
Howbeit , the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not vnto the words of Iephthah which hee sent him .
Then it shall be , that whatsoeuer commeth forth of the doores of my house to meete me , when I returne in peace from the children of Ammon , shall surely be the Lords , and I will offer it vp for a burnt offering .
¶ So Iephthah passed ouer vnto the children of Ammon to fight against them , and the Lord deliuered them into his hands .
And he smote them from Aroer , euen till thou come to Minnith , euen twentie cities , and vnto the plaine of the vineyards , with a very great slaughter : thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
¶ And Iephthah came to Mizpeh vnto his house , and beholde , his daughter came out to meete him with timbrels and with dances , and she was his onely childe : beside her he had neither sonne nor daughter .
And it came to passe when he saw her , that he rent his clothes , and said , Alas , my daughter , thou hast brought me very low , and thou art one of them that trouble me : for I haue opened my mouth vnto the Lord , and I cannot goe backe .
And she said vnto him , My father , if thou hast opened thy mouth vnto the Lord , doe to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth ; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies , euen of the children of Ammon .
And she said vnto her father , Let this thing be done for me : Let me alone two moneths , that I may goe vp and downe vpon the mountaines , and bewaile my virginitie , I , and my fellowes .
And he said , Goe . And he sent her away for two moneths , and shee went with her companions , and bewailed her virginitie vpon the mountaines .
And it came to passe at the ende of two moneths that shee returned vnto her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she knew no man : & it was a custome in Israel ,
<NON-VERSE>
And the men of Ephraim gathered themselues together , and went Northward , & said vnto Iephthah , Wherefore passedst thou ouer to fight against the children of Ammon , and didst not call vs to goe with thee ? Wee will burne thine house vpon thee with fire .
And Iephthah saide vnto them , I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon : and when I called you , ye deliuered me not out of their hands .
And when I sawe that ye deliuered me not , I put my life in my handes , and passed ouer against the children of Ammon , and the Lord deliuered them into my hand : Wherfore then are ye come vp vnto me this day , to fight against me ?
Then Iephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead , and fought with Ephraim : and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim , because they said , Yee Gileadites are fugitiues of Ephraim , among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites .
And the Gileadites tooke the passages of Iordan before the Ephraimites : and it was so that when those Ephraimites which were escaped saide , Let me go ouer , that the men of Gilead said vnto him , Art thou an Ephraimite ? If he said , Nay :
Then said they vnto him , Say now , Shibboleth : and he said , Sibboleth : for hee could not frame to pronounce it right . Then they tooke him , and slewe him at the passages of Iordan : and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites , fourtie & two thousand .
And Iephthah iudged Israel sixe yeeres : then died Iephthah the Gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
¶ And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem iudged Israel .
And hee had thirtie sonnes , and thirtie daughters , whome hee sent abroad , and tooke in thirtie daughters from abroad for his sonnes . And hee iudged Israel seuen yeeres .
Then died Ibzan , and was buried at Bethlehem .
¶ And after him , Elon , a Zebulonite iudged Israel , and he iudged Israel ten yeeres .
And Elon the Zebulonite died , and was buried in Aiialon in the countrey of Zebulun .
¶ And after him , Abdon , the sonne of Hillel a Pirathonite iudged Israel .
And he had fourty sonnes , and thirtie nephewes , that rode on threescore and ten asse - colts : and he iudged Israel eight yeeres ,
<NON-VERSE>
And the children of Israel did euill againe in the sight of the Lord , and the Lord deliuered them into the hand of the Philistines forty yeeres .
¶ And there was a certaine man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah , and his wife was barren , and bare not .
And the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto the woman , and said vnto her , Behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceiue and beare a sonne .
Now therefore beware I pray thee , and drinke not wine , nor strong drinke , and eat not any vncleane thing .
For loe , thou shalt conceiue , and beare a sonne , and no rasor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite vnto God from the wombe : and he shall begin to deliuer Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
¶ Then the woman came , and told her husband , saying ; A man of God came vnto mee , and his countenance was like the countenance of an Angel of God , very terrible : but I asked him not whence he was , neither told he me his name :
But he said vnto mee , Behold , thou shalt conceiue and beare a sonne ; and now , drinke no wine nor strong drinke , neither eate any vncleane thing : for the childe shal be a Nazarite to God , from the wombe , to the day of his death .
¶ Then Manoah entreated the Lord , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which thou didst send , come againe vnto vs , & teach vs what we shall do vnto the childe that shall be borne .
And God hearkened to the voyce of Manoah ; and the Angel of God came againe vnto the woman as shee sate in the field : But Manoah her husband was not with her .
And the woman made haste , and ranne , and shewed her husband , and said vnto him ; Behold , the man hath appeared vnto me , that came vnto me the other day .
And Manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said vnto him , Art thou the man that spakest vnto the woman ? And he said , I am .
And Manoah said , Now let thy words come to passe : How shall wee order the childe , and how shall we doe vnto him ?
And the Angel of the Lord said vnto Manoah , Of all that I said vnto the woman , let her beware .
She may not eate of any thing that commeth of the Uine , neither let her drinke wine or strong drinke , nor eat any vncleane thing : all that I commanded her , let her obserue .
¶ And Manoah saide vnto the Angel of the Lord , I pray thee let vs deteine thee , vntill wee shall haue made ready a kid for thee .
And the Angel of the Lord said vnto Manoah , Though thou deteine mee , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it vnto the Lord : for Manoah knew not that he was an Angel of the Lord .
And Manoah said vnto the Angel of the Lord , What is thy name , that when thy sayings come to passe , we may doe thee honour ?
And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him , Why askest thou thus after my name , seeing it is secret ?
So Manoah tooke a kid , with a meat offering , and offered it vpon a rocke vnto the Lord : and the Angel did wonderously , and Manoah and his wife looked on .
For it came to passe , when the flame went vp toward heauen from off the altar , that the Angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar : and Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
( But the Angel of the Lord did no more appeare to Manoah and to his wife : ) then Manoah knewe that he was an Angel of the Lord .
And Manoah said vnto his wife , Wee shall surely die , because wee haue seene God .
But his wife said vnto him , If the Lord were pleased to kill vs , he would not haue receiued a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would hee haue shewed vs all these things , nor would as at this time haue told vs such things as these .
¶ And the woman bare a sonne , and called his name Samson : and the child grew , & the Lord blessed him .
<NON-VERSE>
And Samson went down to Timnath , and sawe a woman in Timnath , of the daughters of the Philistines .
And hee came vp , and told his father and his mother , and said , I haue seene a woman in Timnath , of the daughters of the Philistines : nowe therefore get her for me to wife .
Then his father and his mother said vnto him , Is there neuer a woman among the daughters of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the vncircumcised Philistines ? And Samson said vnto his father , Get her for me , for shee pleaseth me well .
But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord , that hee sought an occasion against the Philistines : for at that time the Philistines had dominion ouer Israel .
¶ Then went Samson downe , and his father & his mother , to Timnath , and came , to the vineyards of Timnath : and behold , a young Lion roared against him .
And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily vpon him , and hee rent him as he would haue rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but hee told not his father or his mother what hee had done .
And hee went downe and talked with the woman , and she pleased Samson well .
¶ And after a time hee returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carkeis of the Lion : and beholde , there was a swarme of Bees , and honie in the carkeis of the Lion .
And hee tooke thereof in his handes , and went on eating , and came to his father and mother , and hee gaue them , and they did eate : but he told not them that he had taken the hony out of the carkeis of the Lion .
¶ So his father went downe vnto the woman , and Samson made there a feast : for so vsed the young men to doe .
And it came to passe when they saw him , that they brought thirtie companions to be with him .
¶ And Samson said vnto them , I will now put foorth a riddle vnto you : if you can certeinly declare it me , within the seuen dayes of the feast , and finde it out , then I will giue you thirtie sheetes , and thirtie change of garments :
But if ye cannot declare it me , then shall yee giue me thirtie sheetes , and thirtie change of garments . And they said vnto him , Put foorth thy riddle , that we may heare it .
And hee said vnto them , Out of the eater came foorth meate , aud out of the strong came foorth sweetnesse . And they could not in three dayes expound the riddle .
And it came to passe on the seuenth day , that they said vnto Samsons wife , Entice thy husband , that hee may declare vnto vs the riddle , lest we burne thee and thy fathers house with fire : Haue yee called vs , to take that wee haue ? is it not so ?
And Samsons wife wept before him , and said , Thou doest but hate me , and louest me not : thou hast put foorth a riddle vnto the children of my people , and hast not tolde it me . And hee said vnto her , Behold , I haue not tolde it my father nor my mother , and shall I tell it thee ?
And shee wept before him the seuen dayes , while the feast lasted : and it came to passe on the seuenth day , that he tolde her , because shee lay sore vpon him : and she tolde the riddle to the children of her people .
And the men of the city said vnto him on the seuenth day before the sunne went downe , What is sweeter then honie ? and what is stronger then a Lion ? And he said vnto them , If ye had not plowed with my heifer , yee had not found out my riddle .
¶ And the Spirit of the Lord came vpon him , and hee went downe to Ashkelon , and slewe thirtie men of them , and tooke their spoile , and gaue change of garments vnto them which expounded the riddle , and his anger was kindled ; and hee went vp to his fathers house .

But it came to passe within a while after , in the time of wheat haruest , that Samson visited his wife with a kid , and he said , I will goe in to my wife into the chamber . But her father would not suffer him to goe in .
And her father saide , I verily thought that thou haddest vtterly hated her , therfore I gaue her to thy companion : is not her younger sister fairer then she ? take her , I pray thee , in stead of her .
¶ And Samson said concerning them , Now shal I be more blamelesse then the Philistines , though I do them a displeasure .
And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and tooke firebrands , and turned taile to taile , and put a firebrand in the midst betweene two tailes .
And when hee had set the brands on fire , he let them goe into the standing corne of the Philistines , and burnt vp both the shockes , and also the standing corne , with the vineyards and oliues .
¶ Then the Philistines saide , Who hath done this ? and they answered , Samson the sonne in law of the Timnite , because hee had taken his wife , and giuen her to his companion . And the Philistines came vp , and burnt her and her father with fire .
¶ And Samson said vnto them , Though ye haue done this , yet will I be auenged of you , and after that , I wil cease .
And he smote them hip and thigh , with a great slaughter ; and hee went down and dwelt in the top of the rocke Etam .
¶ Then the Philistines went vp , and pitched in Iudah , and spread themselues in Lehi .
And the men of Iudah said , Why are ye come vp against vs ? and they answered , To bind Samson are we come vp , to doe to him , as he hath done to vs .
Then three thousand men of Iudah went to the top of the rocke Etam , and sayd to Samson ; Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers ouer vs ? What is this that thou hast done vnto vs ? And he said vnto them , As they did vnto me , so haue I done vnto them .
And they said vnto him , Wee are come downe to binde thee , that we may deliuer thee into the hand of the Philistines . And Samson said vnto them , Sweare vnto me , that yee will not fall vpon me your selues .
And they spake vnto him , saying ; No : but wee will binde thee fast , and deliuer thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee . And they bound him with two new cordes , and brought him vp from the rocke .
¶ And when he came vnto Lehi , the Philistines shouted against him : and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily vpon him , and the cordes that were vpon his armes became as flaxe that was burnt with fire , & his bands loosed from off his hands .
And it came to passe when he had made an end of speaking , that hee cast away the iaw bone out of his hand , and called that place Ramath - Lehi .
¶ And hee was sore athirst , and called on the Lord , and said , Thou hast giuen this great deliuerance into the hand of thy seruant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the vncircumcised ?
But God claue an hollow place that was in the iawe , and there came water thereout , & when he had drunke , his spirit came againe , and he reuiued : wherefore hee called the name thereof En - hakkore , which is in Lehi , vnto this day :

Then went Samson to Gaza , and saw there an harlot , and went in vnto her .
And it was told the Gazites , saying , Samson is come hither . And they compassed him in , and layd wait for him all night in the gate of the citie , and were quiet all the night , saying , In the morning when it is day , we shall kill him .
And Samson lay till midnight , and arose at midnight , and tooke the doores of the gate of the city , and the two posts , and went away with them , barre and all , and put them vpon his shoulders , and caried them vp to the toppe of an hill that is before Hebron .
¶ And it came to passe afterward , that he loued a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
And the lords of the Philistines came vp vnto her , and said vnto her , Entice him , and see wherein his great strength lieth , and by what meanes we may preuaile against him , that we may bind him , to afflict him : and we will giue thee euery one of vs , eleuen hundreth pieces of siluer .
¶ And Delilah said to Samson , Tel me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lyeth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound , to afflict thee .
And Samson said vnto her , If they binde mee with seuen greene withs , that were neuer dried , then shall I be weake , and be as another man .
Then the lords of the Philistines brought vp to her seuen greene withs , which had not bene dried , & she bound him with them .
Now there were men lying in wait , abiding with her in the chamber : and she said vnto him , The Philistines be vpon thee , Samson . And he brake the withs , as a threed of tow is broken , when it toucheth the fire : so his strength was not knowen .
And Delilah said vnto Samson , Behold , thou hast mocked me , and told mee lies : now tell mee , I pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound .
And he said vnto her , If they bind me fast with newe ropes that neuer were occupied , then shall I bee weake , and be as another man .
And she fastened it with the pinne , and said vnto him , The Philistines be vpon thee , Samson . And hee awaked out of his sleepe , and went away with the pinne of the beame , & with the web .
¶ And shee said vnto him , How canst thou say , I loue thee , when thine heart is not with mee ? Thou hast mocked mee these three times , and hast not told me wherin thy great strength lieth .
And it came to passe , when she pressed him daily with her wordes , and vrged him so that his soule was vexed vnto death ,
That he told her all his heart , and said vnto her , There hath not come a rasor vpon mine head : for I haue bene a Nazarite vnto God from my mothers wombe : If I bee shauen , then my strength will goe from me , and I shall become weake , and bee like any other man .
And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines , saying , Come vp this once , for hee hath shewed me all his heart . Then the lords of the Philistines came vp vnto her , & brought money in their hand .
And she made him sleepe vpon her knees , and she called for a man , and she caused him to shaue off the seuen lockes of his head , and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
And she said , The Philistines be vpon thee , Samson . And hee awoke out of his sleepe , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake my selfe . And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him .
¶ But the Philistines tooke him and put out his eyes , and brought him downe to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brasse , and he did grind in the prison house .
Howbeit , the haire of his head began to grow againe , after he was shauen .
Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together , for to offer a great sacrifice vnto Dagon their god , and to reioyce : for they said , Our god hath deliuered Samson our enemy into our hand .
And when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath deliuered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our countrey , which slew many of vs .
And it came to passe when their hearts were merry , that they said , Call for Samson , that hee may make vs sport . And they called for Samson out of the prison house , and he made them sport , and they set him betweene the pillars .
And Samson said vnto the lad that held him by the hand , Suffer mee , that I may feele the pillars whereupon the house standeth , that I may leane vpon them .
Now the house was full of men and women , and all the lords of the Philistines were there : and there were vpon the roofe about three thousand men and women , that behelde while Samson made sport .
And Samson called vnto the Lord , and said , O Lord God , remember me , I pray thee , & strengthen mee , I pray thee , onely this once , O God , that I may be at once auenged of the Philistines , for my two eyes . And Samson tooke hold of the two middle pillars , vpon which the house stood , and on which it was borne vp , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
And Samson said , Let me die with the Philistines : & he bowed himselfe with all his might : and the house fel vpon the lords , and vpon all the people that were therein : so the dead which he slew at his death , were moe , then they which he slew in his life .

And there was a man of mount Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
And he said vnto his mother , The eleuen hundred shekels of siluer , that were taken from thee , about which thou cursedst , and spakest of also in mine eares , behold , the siluer is with mee , I tooke it . And his mother said , Blessed be thou of the Lord , my sonne .
And when hee had restored the eleuen hundred shekels of siluer to his mother , his mother said , I had wholly dedicated the siluer vnto the Lord , from my hand , for my sonne , to make a grauen image and a molten image : now therefore I will restore it vnto thee .
Yet hee restored the money vnto his mother , and his mother tooke two hundred shekels of siluer , and gaue them to the founder , who made thereof a grauen image and a molten image , and they were in the house of Micah .
And the man Micah had an house of gods , and made an Ephod , and Teraphim , and consecrated one of his sonnes , who became his Priest .
In those dayes there was no king in Israel , but euery man did that which was right in his owne eyes .
¶ And there was a young man out of Bethlehem Iudah , of the family of Iudah , who was a Leuite , and he soiourned there .
And the man departed out of the citie from Bethlehem Iudah , to soiourne where he could finde a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he iourneyed .
And Micah said vnto him , Whence commest thou ? And he said vnto him , I am a Leuite , of Bethlehem Iudah , and I goe to soiourne where I may finde a place .
And Micah said vnto him , Dwell with me , and be vnto me a father and a Priest , and I will giue thee ten shekels of siluer by the yeere , and a suite of apparell , and thy victuals . So the Leuite went in .
And the Leuite was content to dwell with the man , and the yong man was vnto him as one of his sonnes .
And Micah consecrated the Leuite , and the young man became his Priest , and was in the house of Micah .

In those dayes there was no king in Israel : and in those daies the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwel in : for vnto that day , all their inheritance had not fallen vnto them , among the tribes of Israel .
And the children of Dan sent of their family , fiue men from their coasts , men of valour , from Zorah , and from Eshtaol , to spy out the land , and to search it , and they said vnto them , Goe , search the land : Who when they came to mount Ephraim , to the house of Micah , they lodged there .
When they were by the house of Micah , they knew the voice of the yong man the Leuite : and they turned in thither , & said vnto him , Who brought thee hither ? And what makest thou in this place ? and what hast thou here ?
And hee said vnto them , Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me , and hath hired me , and I am his Priest .
And they sayd vnto him , Aske counsell , we pray thee , of God , that we may know , whether our way which we goe , shall be prosperous .
And the Priest said vnto them , Goe in peace : before the Lord is your way wherein ye goe .
¶ Then the fiue men departed , and came to Laish , and saw the people that were therein , how they dwelt carelesse , after the maner of the Zidonians , quiet and secure , and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing , and they were farre from the Zidonians , and had no businesse with any man .
And they came vnto their brethren to Zorah , and Eshtaol : and their brethren said vnto them , What say yee ?
And they said , Arise , that we may goe vp against them : for we haue seene the land , and behold , it is very good : and are ye still ? Bee not slothfull to goe , and to enter to possesse the land .
When ye goe , ye shall come vnto a people secure , and to a large land : for God hath giuen it into your handes : a place where there is no want of any thing , that is in the earth .
¶ And there went from thence of the family of the Danites out of Zorah , and out of Eshtaol , sixe hundred men , appoynted with weapons of warre .
And they went vp , and pitched in Kiriath - iearim , in Iudah : Wherefore they called that place Mahaneh - Dan , vnto this day : behold , it is behinde Kiriath - iearim .
And they passed thence vnto mount Ephraim , and came vnto the house of Micah .
¶ Then answered the fiue men that went to spie out the countrey of Laish , and saide vnto their brethren , Doe ye know that there is in these houses an Ephod , and Teraphim , and a grauen image , and a molten image ? Now therefore consider what ye haue to doe .
And the fiue men that went to spie out the land , went vp and came in thither , and tooke the grauen image , and the Ephod , and the Teraphim , and the molten image : and the Priest stood in the entring of the gate , with the sixe hundreth men that were appointed with weapons of warre .
And these went into Micahs house , and fetched the carued image , the Ephod , and the Teraphim , and the molten image : then said the Priest vnto them , What doe ye ?
And they said vnto him , Hold thy peace , lay thine hand vpon thy mouth , and goe with vs , and bee to vs a father and a Priest : Is it better for thee to bee a Priest vnto the house of one man , or that thou be a Priest vnto a tribe and a family in Israel ?
¶ And when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men that were in the houses neere to Micahs house , were gathered together , and ouertooke the children of Dan .
And they cried vnto the children of Dan : and they turned their faces , and said vnto Micah , What aileth thee , that thou commest with such a company ?
And he said , Yee haue taken away my gods which I made , and the Priest , and ye are gone away : and what haue I more ? and what is this that yee say vnto me , What aileth thee ?
And the children of Dan said vnto him , Let not thy voyce bee heard among vs , lest angry fellowes run vpon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the liues of thy houshold .
And the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah sawe that they were too strong for him , he turned and went backe vnto his house .
And they tooke the things which Micah had made , and the Priest which hee had , and came vnto Laish , vnto a people that were at quiet , and secure , and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the citie with fire .
And there was no deliuerer , because it was farre from Zidon , and they had no businesse with any man : and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth - rehob , and they built a citie , and dwelt therein .
And they called the name of the city , Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was borne vnto Israel : howbeit the name of the citie was Laish at the first .
¶ And the children of Dan set vp the grauen image : and Ionathan the sonne of Gershom , the sonne of Manasseh , hee and his sonnes , were Priests to the tribe of Dan , vntill the day of the captiuitie of the land .

And it came to passe in those dayes , when there was no King in Israel , that there was a certaine Leuite soiourning on the side of mount Ephraim , who tooke to him a concubine out of Bethlehem Iudah .
And his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him vnto her fathers house to Bethlehem Iudah , and was there foure whole moneths .
And her husband arose , and went after her to speake friendly vnto her , and to bring her againe , hauing his seruant with him , and a couple of asses : and shee brought him into her fathers house , and when the father of the damsell saw him , he reioyced to meet him .
And they sate downe , and did eat and drinke both of them together : for the damosels father had saide vnto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tary all night , and let thine heart be merrie .
And when the man rose vp to depart , his father in law vrged him : therfore he lodged there againe .
And hee arose early in the morning on the fift day to depart , and the damosels father sayd , Comfort thine heart , I pray thee . And they taried vntill after noone , and they did eate both of them .
And when the man rose vp to depart , hee and his concubine , and his seruant ; his father in law , the damsels father , said vnto him , Behold , now the day draweth towardes euening , I pray you tarie all night : behold , the day groweth to an ende , lodge heere , that thine heart may be merrie ; and to morrow get you early on your way , that thou mayest goe home .
But the man would not tary that night , but he rose vp and departed , and came ouer against Iebus ( which is Ierusalem : ) and there were with him two asses sadled , his concubine also was with him .
And when they were by Iebus , the day was farre spent , and the seruant said vnto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let vs turne in into this citie of the Iebusites , and lodge in it .
And his master said vnto him , We will not turne aside hither into the citie of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel , we will passe ouer to Gibeah .
And hee sayde vnto his seruant , Come , and let vs draw neere to one of these places to lodge all night , in Gibeah , or in Ramah .
And they passed on and went their way , and the sunne went downe vpon them when they were by Gibeah , which belongeth to Beniamin .
And they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sate him downe in a street of the citie : for there was no man that tooke them into his house to lodging .
¶ And behold , there came an olde man from his worke out of the field at euen , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and hee soiourned in Gibeah , but the men of the place were Beniamites .
And when he had lift vp his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the streete of the citie : and the old man said , Whither goest thou ? and whence commest thou ?
And he said vnto him , We are passing from Bethlehem Iudah , toward the side of mount Ephraim , from thence am I : and I went to Bethlehem Iudah , but I am now going to the house of the Lord , and there is no man that receiueth me to house .
Yet there is both straw and prouender for our asses , and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which is with thy seruants : there is no want of any thing .
And the olde man said , Peace be with thee ; howsoeuer , let all thy wants lie vpon me ; only lodge not in the street .
So he brought him into his house , and gaue prouender vnto the asses : and they washed their feet , and did eate and drinke .
¶ Now as they were making their hearts merrie , behold , the men of the citie , certaine sonnes of Belial , beset the house round about , and beat at the doore , and spake to the master of the house , the olde man , saying ; Bring foorth the man that came into thine house , that we may know him .
And the man , the master of the house , went out vnto them , and said vnto them , Nay my brethren , nay , I pray you doe not so wickedly ; seeing that this man is come into mine house , doe not this folly .
Behold , here is my daughter , a maiden , and his concubine , them I wil bring out now , and humble yee them , and doe with them what seemeth good vnto you : but vnto this man doe not so vile a thing .
But the men would not hearken to him : so the man tooke his concubine , and brought her foorth vnto them , and they knew her , and abused her all the night vntil the morning : and when the day began to spring , they let her goe .
Then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell downe at the doore of the mans house , where her lord was , till it was light .
And her lord rose vp in the morning , & opened the doores of the house , and went out to goe his way : and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen downe at the doore of the house , and her hands were vpon the threshold .
And he said vnto her , Up , and let vs be going . But none answered : then the man tooke her vp vpon an asse , and the man rose vp , and gate him vnto his place .
¶ And when he was come into his house , hee tooke a knife , and layd hold on his concubine , and diuided her , together with her bones , into twelue pieces , and sent her into all the coasts of Israel .

Then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was gathered together as one man , from Dan euen to Beer - sheba , with the land of Gilead , vnto the Lord in Mizpeh .
And the chiefe of al the people , euen of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselues in the assembly of the people of God , foure hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .
( Now the children of Beniamin heard that the children of Israel were gone vp to Mizpeh . ) Then said the children of Israel , Tell vs , how was this wickednesse ?
And the Leuite the husband of the woman that was slaine , answered and said , I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Beniamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
And the men of Gibeah rose against me , and beset the house round about vpon me by night , and thought to haue slaine mee , and my concubine haue they forced that she is dead .
And I tooke my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the countrey of the inheritance of Israel : for they haue committed lewdnesse and folly in Israel .
Behold , ye are all children of Israel , giue here your aduise and counsell .
¶ And all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of vs goe to his tent , neither will wee any of vs turne into his house :
But now , this shall bee the thing which we will doe to Gibeah , we will goe vp by lot against it :
And we wil take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel , and an hundred of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand , to fetch victuall for the people , that they may doe , when they come to Gibeah of Beniamin , according to all the folly that they haue wrought in Israel .
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the citie , knit together as one man .
¶ And the tribes of Israel sent men thorow all the tribe of Beniamin , saying , What wickednesse is this that is done among you ?
Now therfore deliuer vs the men , the children of Belial which are in Gibeah , that wee may put them to death , and put away euill from Israel : but the children of Beniamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel .
But the children of Beniamin gathered themselues together out of the cities , vnto Gibeah , to goe out to battell against the children of Israel .
And the children of Beniamin were numbred at that time out of the cities , twentie and sixe thousand men that drew sword , beside the inhabitants of Gibeah , which were numbred seuen hundred chosen men .
Among all this people there were seuen hundred chosen men left handed , euery one could sling stones at an haire breadth , and not misse .
And the men of Israel , beside Beniamin , were numbred foure hundred thousand men that drewe sword ; all these were men of warre .
¶ And the children of Israel arose , and went vp to the house of God , and asked counsell of God , and saide , Which of vs shall goe vp first to the battell against the children of Beniamin ? And the Lord said , Iudah shall goe vp first .
And the children of Israel rose vp in the morning , and encamped against Gibeah .
And the men of Israel went out to battell against Beniamin , and the men of Israel put themselues in aray to fight against them at Gibeah .
And the children of Beniamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroied downe to the ground of the Israelites that day , twenty & two thousand men .
And the people the men of Israel incouraged themselues , & set their battel againe in aray , in the place where they put themselues in aray the first day .
( And the children of Israel went vp and wept before the Lord vntill Euen , and asked counsel of the Lord , saying , Shall I goe vp againe to battell against the children of Beniamin my brother ? And the Lord saide , Goe vp against him . ) And the children of Israel came neere against the children of Beniamin , the second day .
And Beniamin went foorth against them out of Gibeah the second day , & destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel againe , eighteene thousand men , all these drew the sword .
¶ Then all the children of Israel , and all the people went vp , and came vnto the house of God , and wept , and sate there before the Lord , and fasted that day vntill Euen , and offered burnt offerings , and peace offerings before the Lord .
And the children of Israel enquired of the Lord , ( for the Arke of the couenant of God was there in those daies ,
And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron stood before it in those dayes . ) saying ; Shall I yet againe goe out to battel against the children of Beniamin my brother , or shall I cease ? And the Lord said , Goe vp ; for to morrow I will deliuer them into thine hand .
And Israel set lyers in waite round about Gibeah .
And the children of Israel went vp against the children of Beniamin on the third day , and put themselues in aray against Gibeah , as at other times .
And the children of Beniamin went out against the people , and were drawen away from the citie , and they began to smite of the people and kill as at other times , in the high wayes , of which one goeth vp to the house of God , and the other to Gibeah in the field , about thirtie men of Israel .
And the children of Beniamin said , They are smitten downe before vs , as at the first : But the children of Israel said , Let vs flee , and draw them from the citie , vnto the high wayes .
And the Lord smote Beniamin before Israel , and the children of Israel destroyed of the Beniamites that day , twentie and fiue thousand , and an hundred men ; all these drew the sword . So the children of Beniamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gaue place to the Beniamites , because they trusted vnto the lyers in wait , which they had set beside Gibeah .
And the liers in wait hasted , and rushed vpon Gibeah , and the liers in wait drew themselues along , and smote all the citie with the edge of the sword .
Nowe there was an appointed signe between the men of Israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise vp out of the citie .
And when the men of Israel retired in the battell , Beniamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirtie persons ; for they saide , Surely they are smitten downe before vs , as in the first battell .
But when the flame began to arise vp out of the citie , with a pillar of smoke , the Beniamites looked behind them , and behold , the flame of the citie ascended vp to heauen .
And when the men of Israel turned againe , the men of Beniamin were amased ; for they saw that euill was come vpon them .
Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel , vnto the way of the wildernes , but the battel ouertooke them : & them which came out of the cities , they destroyed in the midst of them .
Thus they inclosed the Beniamites round about , and chased them , and trode them downe with ease ouer against Gibeah toward the sunne rising .
And there fell of Beniamin eighteene thousand men ; all these were men of valour .
And they turned and fled toward the wildernesse vnto the rocke of Rimmon : and they gleaned of them in the high wayes fiue thousand men : and pursued hard after them vnto Gidom , and slew two thousand men of them .
So that all which fell that day of Beniamin , were twentie and fiue thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valour .
But sixe hundred men turned and fledde to the wildernesse vnto the rocke Rimmon , and abode in the rocke Rimmon foure moneths .

Nowe the men of Israel had sworne in Mizpeh , saying , There shall not any of vs giue his daughter vnto Beniamin to wife .
And the people came to the house of God , and abode there till euen before God , and lift vp their voices , and wept sore :
And said , O Lord God of Israel , why is this come to passe in Israel , that there should bee to day one tribe lacking in Israel ?
And it came to passe on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an Altar , and offered burnt offerings , and peace offerings .
And the children of Israel sayd , Who is there among all the tribes of Israel , that came not vp with the congregation vnto the Lord ? for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not vp to the Lord to Mizpeh , saying , He shall surely be put to death .
And the children of Israel repented them for Beniamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day :
How shall wee doe for wiues for them that remaine , seeing wee haue sworne by the Lord , that wee will not giue them of our daughters to wiues ?
¶ And they said , What one is there of the tribes of Israel , that came not vp to Mizpeh to the Lord ? And beholde , there came none to the campe from Iabesh Gilead to the assembly .
For the people were numbred , and behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead there .
And the congregation sent thither twelue thousand men of the valiantest , and commaunded them , saying , Goe , and smite the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children .
And this is the thing that yee shall doe , Yee shall vtterly destroy euery male , and euery woman that hath lien by man .
And they found among the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead , foure hundred yong virgins that had knowen no man , by lying with any male : and they brought them vnto the campe to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
And the whole Congregation sent some to speake to the children of Beniamin that were in the rocke Rimmon , and to call peaceably vnto them .
And Beniamin came againe at that time , and they gaue them wiues which they had saued aliue of the women of Iabesh Gilead : and yet so they sufficed them not .
And the people repented them for Beniamin , because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
¶ Then the Elders of the Congregation said , How shall we doe for wiues for them that remaine ? seeing the women are destroyed out of Beniamin .
And they said , There must be an inheritance for them that bee escaped of Beniamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
Howbeit wee may not giue them wiues of our daughters . For the children of Israel haue sworne , saying , Cursed be he that giueth a wife to Beniamin .
Then they said , Behold , there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yerely , in a place which is on the Northside of Bethel on the East side of the hie way that goeth vp from Bethel to Shechem , and on the South of Lebanon .
Therefore they commanded the children of Beniamin , saying , Goe and lie in wait in the vineyards .
And see , and behold , if the daughters of Shiloh come out to daunce in daunces , then come yee out of the vineyards , and catch you euery man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh , and goe to the land of Beniamin .
And it shall bee when their fathers or their brethren come vnto vs to complaine , that we will say vnto them , Bee fauourable vnto them for our sakes : because we reserued not to each man his wife in the warre : for yee did not giue vnto them at this time , that you should be guiltie .
And the children of Beniamin did so , and tooke them wiues according to their number , of them that daunced , whome they caught : and they went and returned vnto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
And the children of Israel departed thence at that time , euery man to his tribe , and to his family , and they went out from thence euery man to his inheritance .

How doeth the citie sit solitarie that was full of people ? How is she become as a widow ? She that was great among the nations , and princesse among the prouinces , how is she become tributarie ?
Shee weepeth sore in the night , and her teares are on her cheekes : among all her louers she hath none to comfort her , all her friends haue dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
Iudah is gone into captiuitie , because of affliction , and because of great seruitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors ouertook her betweene the straits .
The wayes of Zion do mourne , because none come to the solemne feasts : all her gates are desolate : her priests sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitternesse .
Her aduersaries are the chiefe , her enemies prosper : for the Lord hath afflicted her ; for the multitude of her transgressions , her children are gone into captiuitie before the enemie .
And from the daughter of Zion all her beautie is departed : her princes are become like Harts that find no pasture , & they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
Ierusalem remembred in the dayes of her affliction , and of her miseries , all her pleasant things that she had in the dayes of old , when her people fell into the hand of the enemie , and none did helpe her , the aduersaries saw her , and did mocke at her Sabbaths .
Ierusalem hath grieuously sinned , therefore she is remoued : all that honoured her , despise her , because they haue seene her nakednesse : yea , shee sigheth and turneth backward .
Her filthines is in her skirts , she remembreth not her last end , therfore she came downe wonderfully : shee had no comforter : O Lord , behold my affliction : for the enemie hath magnified himselfe .
The aduersarie hath spread out his hand vpon all her pleasant things : for she hath seene that the heathen entred into her Sanctuarie , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation .
All her people sigh , they seek bread , they haue giuen their pleasant things for meate to relieue the soule : see , O Lord , & consider : for I am become vile .
¶ Is it nothing to you , all ye that passe by ? Behold and see , if there be any sorow like vnto my sorowe , which is done vnto me , wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me , in the day of his fierce anger .
From aboue hath he sent fire into my bones , and it preuaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feete , he hath turned me backe : he hath made me desolate , and faint all the day .
The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , and come vp vpon my necke : he hath made my strength to fall , the Lord hath deliuered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise vp .
The Lord hath troden vnder foot all my mightie men in the midst of me : he hath called an assembly against mee , to crush my yong men . The Lord hath troden the virgine , the daughter of Iudah , as in a wine presse .
For these things I weepe , mine eye , mine eye runneth downe with water , because the comforter that should relieue my soule is farre from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy preuailed .
Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the Lord hath commanded concerning Iacob , that his aduersaries should bee round about him : Ierusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
¶ The Lord is righteous , for I haue rebelled against his commandement : heare , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorow : my virgins and my yong men are gone into captiuitie .
I called for my louers , but they deceiued me : my priests and mine elders gaue vp the ghost in the citie , while they sought their meat to relieue their soules
Behold , O Lord : for I am in distresse : my bowels are troubled : mine heart is turned within mee , for I haue grieuously rebelled : abroad the sword bereaueth , at home there is as death .
They haue heard that I sigh , there is none to comfort me : all mine enemies haue heard of my trouble , they are glad that thou hast done it : thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called , and they shall be like vnto me .

How hath the Lord couered the daughter of Zion with a cloud , in his anger , and cast downe from heauen vnto the earth the beautie of Israel , and remembred not his footstoole in the day of his anger ?
The Lord hath swallowed vp all the habitations of Iacob , and hath not pitied : he hath throwen downe in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Iudah : he hath brought them down to the ground : hee hath polluted the kingdome and the princes thereof .
He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horne of Israel : he hath drawen backe his right hand from before the enemy , and he burned against Iacob like a flaming fire which deuoureth round about .
He hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an aduersary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye , in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion : he powred out his furie like fire .
The Lord was an enemie : he hath swallowed vp Israel , hee hath swallowed vp all her palaces : he hath destroyed his strong holds , and hath increased in the daughter of Iudah mourning and lamentation .
And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle , as if it were of a garden , hee hath destroyed his places of the assembly : the Lord hath caused the solemne feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion , and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the King and the Priest .
The Lord hath cast off his Altar : hee hath abhorred his Sanctuarie : he hath giuen vp into the hand of the enemie the walles of her palaces : they haue made a noise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a solemne Feast .
The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion : he hath stretched out a line : he hath not withdrawen his hand from destroying : therefore hee made the rampart and the wall to lament : they languished together .
Her gates are sunke into the ground : he hath destroyed and broken her barres : her King and her Princes are among the Gentiles : the Law is no more , her prophets also finde no vision from the Lord .
The Elders of the daughter of Zion sit vpon the ground and keepe silence : they haue cast vp dust vpon their heads : they haue girded themselues with sackcloth : the virgins of Ierusalem hang downe their heades to the ground .
Mine eyes doe faile with teares : my bowels are troubled : my liuer is powred vpon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people , because the children and the sucklings swoone in the streets of the citie .
They say to their mothers , Where is corne and wine ? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the citie , when their soule was powred out into their mothers bosome .
What thing shall I take to witnesse for thee ? what thing shall I liken to thee , O daughter of Ierusalem ? what shall I equal to thee , that I may comfort thee , O Uirgin daughter of Zion ? for thy breach is great like the sea : who can heale thee ?
Thy Prophets haue seene vaine and foolish things for thee , and they haue not discouered thine iniquitie , to turne away thy captiuitie : but haue seene for thee false burdens , and causes of banishment .
All that passe by , clap their hands at thee : they hisse and wagge their head at the daughter of Ierusalem , saying , Is this the citie that men call the perfection of beauty , the ioy of the whole earth ?
All thine enemies haue opened their mouth against thee : they hisse and gnash the teeth : they say , We haue swallowed her vp : certainly this is the day that we looked for : we haue found , we haue seene it .
The Lord hath done that which he had deuised : he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the dayes of old : hee hath throwen downe and hath not pitied : and he hath caused thine enemie to reioyce ouer thee , hee hath set vp the horne of thine aduersaries .
Their heart cried vnto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let teares runne downe like a riuer , day and night : giue thy selfe no rest , let not the apple of thine eyes cease .
Arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watches powre out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift vp thy handes toward him , for the life of thy yong children , that faint for hunger in the top of euery streete .
¶ Behold , O Lord , and consider to whom thou hast done this : shal the women eat their fruit , and children of a spanne long ? shall the priest and the prophet be slaine in the Sanctuary of the Lord ?
The yong and the old lye on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my yong men are fallen by the sword : thou hast slaine them in the day of thy anger : thou hast killed , and not pitied .

I Am the man that hath seene affliction by the rod of his wrath .
He hath led me and brought mee into darkenesse , but not into light .
Surely against me is he turned , he turneth his hand against me all the day .
My flesh and my skinne hath he made old , he hath broken my bones .
He hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and trauel .
He hath set me in darke places , as they that be dead of old .
He hath hedged me about , that I cannot get out : hee hath made my chaine heauie .
Also when I cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer .
Hee hath inclosed my wayes with hewen stone : he hath made my pathes crooked .
He was vnto me as a Beare lying in waite , and as a Lion in secret places .
Hee hath turned aside my wayes , and pulled me in pieces : hee hath made me desolate .
He hath bent his bow , and set me as a marke for the arrow .
Hee hath caused the arrowes of his quiuer to enter into my reines .
I was a derision to all my people , and their song all the day .
Hee hath filled me with bitternesse , hee hath made me drunken with wormewood .
And I said , My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord :
They are newe euery morning : great is thy faithfulnesse .
It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the saluation of the Lord .
It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth .
Hee sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because hee hath borne it vpon him .
He putteth his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
Hee giueth his cheeke to him that smiteth him , hee is filled full with reproch .
For the Lord will not cast off for euer .
But though hee cause griefe , yet will hee haue compassion according to the multitude of his mercies .
For he doth not afflict willingly , nor grieue the children of men .
To subuert a man in his cause , the Lord approoueth not .
¶ Who is hee that sayth , and it commeth to passe , when the Lord commandeth it not ?
Out of the mouth of the most hie proceedeth not euill and good ?
Wherefore doeth a liuing man complaine , a man for the punishment of his sinnes ?
Let vs search and try our waies , and turne againe to the Lord .
Let vs lift vp our heart with our hands vnto God in the heauens . We haue transgressed , and haue rebelled , thou hast not pardoned .
Thou hast couered with anger , and persecuted vs : thou hast slaine , thou hast not pitied .
Thou hast couered thy selfe with a cloud , that our prayer should not passe through .
Thou hast made vs as the offscouring and refuse in the middest of the people .
All our enemies haue opened their mouthes against vs .
Feare and a snare is come vpon vs , desolation and destruction . Mine eye runneth downe with riuers of water , for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Mine eye trickleth downe and ceaseth not , without any intermission :
Till the Lord looke downe , and behold from heauen .
Mine eye affecteth mine heart , because of all the daughters of my city .
Mine enemies chased me sore like a bird , without cause .
They haue cut off my life in the dungeon , and cast a stone vpon me .
Waters flowed ouer mine head , then I sayd , I am cut off .
¶ I called vpon thy name , O Lord , out of the low dungeon .
Thou hast heard my voice , hide not thine eare at my breathing , at my crie .
O Lord , thou hast seene my wrong , iudge thou my cause . Thou hast seene all their vengeance ; and all their imaginations against me .
Thou hast heard their reproch , O Lord , and all their imaginations against me :
¶ Render vnto them a recompense , O Lord , according to the worke of their hands .
Giue them sorrow of heart , thy curse vnto them .

For the punishment of the iniquitie of the daughter of my people , is greater then the punishment of the sinne of Sodom , that was ouerthrowen as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
Her Nazarites were purer then snow , they were whiter then milke , they were more ruddie in body then rubies , their polishing was of Saphir .

They cryed vnto them ; Depart yee , it is vncleane , depart , depart , touch not , when they fled away and wandred : they said among the heathen , They shall no more soiourne there .

And the sonnes of Aaron brought the blood vnto him , and he dipt his finger in the blood , and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar , and powred out the blood at the bottome of the Altar .

Then Moses said vnto Aaron , This is it that the Lord spake , saying , I will bee sanctified in them that come nigh me , and before all the people I will be glorified : And Aaron held his peace .
And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Uzziel , the vncle of Aaron , and said vnto them , Come neere , cary your brethren from before the Sanctuary , out of the campe .
So they went neere , and caried them in their coats out of the campe , as Moses had said .
And Moses said vnto Aaron , and vnto Eleazar and vnto Ithamar his sonnes , Uncouer not your heads , neither rend your clothes , lest you die , and lest wrath come vpon all the people : But let your brethren , the whole house of Israel , bewaile the burning which the Lord hath kindled .
And ye shal not goe out from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation , lest you die : for the anointing oyle of the Lord is vpon you : and they did according to the word of Moses .

And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken vnto them by the hand of Moses .
¶ And Moses spake vnto Aaron , and vnto Eleazar and vnto Ithamar his sonnes that were left , Take the meate offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and eate it without leauen , beside the altar : for it is most holy .
And ye shal eat it in the holy place , because it is thy due , and thy sonnes due of the sacrifices of the Lord , made by fire : for so I am commanded .
And the waue breast and heaue shoulder shall ye eate in a cleane place , thou , and thy sonnes , and thy daughters with thee : For they be thy due and thy sonnes due , which are giuen out of the sacrifice of peace offerings , of the children of Israel .
The heaue shoulder , and the waue breast shal they bring , with the offrings made by fire of the fat , to waue it for a waue offering before the Lord : and it shall bee thine , and thy sonnes with thee , by a statute for euer , as the Lord hath commanded .

Wherefore haue ye not eaten the sinne offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath giuen it you to beare the iniquitie of the Congregation , to make atonement for them , before the Lord ?
Behold , the blood of it was not brought in , within the holy place : yee should indeed haue eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .

And the Priest shall looke on the plague in the skinne of the flesh : and when the haire in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper then the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosie : and the Priest shall looke on him , and pronounce him vncleane .
If the bright spot be white in the skinne of his flesh , and in sight bee not deeper then the skinne , and the haire thereof be not turned white , then the Priest shall shut vp him that hath the plague , seuen dayes .
And the Priest shall looke on him the seuenth day : and beholde , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skinne , then the Priest shall shut him vp seuen dayes more .
And the Priest shall looke on him againe the seuenth day : and beholde , if the plague be somewhat darke , and the plague spread not in the skin ; the Priest shall pronounce him cleane : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be cleane .
But if the scab spread much abroad in the skinne after that hee hath beene seene of the Priest , for his cleansing hee shall be seene of the Priest againe .
And if the Priest see , that behold , the scab spreadeth in the skin , then the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane : it is a leprosie .
¶ When the plague of leprosie is in a man , then he shall be brought vnto the Priest ;
And the Priest shall see him : and behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it haue turned the haire white , and there be quicke raw flesh in the rising :
It is an old leprosie in the skinne of his flesh , and the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane , and shal not shut him vp : for he is vncleane . And if a leprosie breake out abroad in the skin , and the leprosie couer all the skin of him that hath the plague , from his head euen to his foot , wheresoeuer the Priest looketh :
Then the Priest shall consider : and behold , if the leprosie haue couered al his flesh , he shal pronounce him cleane that hath the plague , it is all turned white ; he is cleane .
But when raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be vncleane .
And the Priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce him to bee vncleane : for the raw flesh is vncleane : it is a leprosie .
Or if the raw flesh turne againe , and bee changed vnto white , hee shall come vnto the Priest :
And the Priest shall see him : and beholde , if the plague bee turned into white , then the Priest shall pronounce him cleane that hath the plague ; hee is cleane .
¶ The flesh also , in which , euen in the skinne thereof was a bile , and is healed ,
And in the place of the bile there be a white rising , or a bright spot white , and somewhat reddish , and it be shewed to the Priest :
And if when the Priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower then the skinne , and the haire thereof be turned white , the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane : it is a plague of leprosie broken out of the bile .
But if the Priest looke on it , and behold , there be no white haires therein , and if it be not lower then the skin , but be somewhat darke ; then the Priest shall shut him vp seuen dayes .
And if it spread much abroad in the skinne , then the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane ; it is a plague . But if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning bile ; and the Priest shall pronounce him cleane .
¶ Or if there be any flesh in the skin whereof there is a hot burning , and the quicke flesh that burneth haue a white bright spot , somewhat reddish , or white ;
Then the Priest shall looke vpon it : and behold , if the haire in the bright spot be turned white , and it bee in sight deeper then the skinne , it is a leprosie broken out of the burning : wherefore the Priest shal pronounce him vncleane : it is the plague of leprosie .
But if the Priest looke on it , and behold , there be no white haire in the bright spot , and it be no lower then the other skin , but be somewhat darke , then the Priest shal shut him vp seuen dayes .
And the Priest shall looke vpon him the seuenth day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane ; it is the plague of leprosie .
And if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat darke ; it is a rising of the burning , and the Priest shall pronounce him cleane : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
¶ If a man or woman hath a plague vpon the head or the beard ,
And in the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the plague : and behold , if the skall spread not , and there be in it no yellow haire , and the skall be not in sight deeper then the skin ;
He shall be shauen , but the skall shall he not shaue : and the Priest shall shut vp him that hath the skall , seuen dayes more .
And in the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the skall : and behold , if the skall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper then the skin , then the Priest shall pronounce him cleane : and he shall wash his clothes , and be cleane .
But if the skall spread much in the skinne after his cleansing ,
Then the Priest shall looke on him , and behold , if the skall be spread in the skinne , the Priest shall not seeke for yellow haire : he is vncleane .
But if the skall be in his sight at a stay , and that there is blacke haire growen vp therein : the skall is healed , he is cleane , and the Priest shall pronounce him cleane .
¶ If a man also or a woman haue in the skinne of their flesh bright spots , euen white bright spots ,
And he that hath his haire fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead - bald : yet is hee cleane . And if there be in the bald head , or bald forehead a white reddish sore , it is a leprosie sprung vp in his bald - head , or his bald forehead .
Then the Priest shall looke vpon it : and beholde , if the rising of the sore bee white reddish in his balde head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosie appeareth in the skinne of the flesh ,
Hee is a leprous man , he is vncleane : the Priest shall pronounce him vtterly vncleane , his plague is in his head .
And the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a couering vpon his vpper lip , and shall cry , Uncleane , vncleane .
All the dayes wherein the plague shall bee in him , he shall bee defiled , hee is vncleane : he shall dwell alone , without the campe shall his habitation be .
¶ The garment also , that the plague of leprosie is in , whether it bee a woollen garment , or a linnen garment , Whether it bee in the warpe , or woofe of linnen or of woollen , whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skinne :
And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warpe , or in the woofe , or in any thing of skinne , it is a plague of leprosie , and shall be shewed vnto the Priest .
And the Priest shall looke vpon the plague , and shut vp it that hath the plague , seuen dayes .
And he shall looke on the plague on the seuenth day : if the plague be spread in the garment , either in the warpe , or in the woofe , or in a skin , or in any worke that is made of skinne , the plague is a fretting leprosie ; it is vncleane .
Hee shall therefore burne that garment , whether warpe or woofe , in wollen or in linnen , or any thing of skinne , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosie ; it shall bee burnt in the fire .
And if the Priest shall looke , and behold the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the warpe , or in the woofe , or in any thing of skinne ;
Then the Priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it vp seuen dayes more .
And the Priest shall looke on the plague after that it is washed : and behold , if the plague haue not changed his colour , and the plague be not spread , it is vncleane , thou shalt burne it in the fire , it is fret inward , whether it be bare within or without .
And if the Priest looke , and behold , the plaine be somewhat darke after the washing of it , then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warpe , or out of the woofe .
And if it appeare still in the garment , either in the warpe , or in the woofe , or in any thing of skinne , it is a spreading plague , thou shalt burne that wherein the plague is , with fire . And the garment , either warpe , or woofe , or whatsoeuer thing of skin it bee , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shalbe cleane .

Then shall the Priest command to take for him that is to bee cleansed , two birds aliue , and cleane , and Cedar wood , and scarlet , and hysope .
And the Priest shall command that one of the birds bee killed in an earthen vessell , ouer running water .

Then the Priest shall command that they emptie the house , before the Priest goe into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made vncleane : and afterward the Priest shall goe in , to see the house .

Thus shall Aaron come into the Holy place : with a yong bullocke for a sinne offering , and a ramme for a burnt offering .
Hee shall put on the holy linnen coate , and he shall haue the linnen breeches vpon his flesh , and shall be girded with a linnen girdle , and with the linnen Miter shall hee be attired . These are holy garments : therefore shall he wash his flesh in water , and so put them on .

Therefore I said vnto the children of Israel , No soule of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that soiourneth among you , eat blood .
And whatsoeuer man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that soiourne among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or foule that may be eaten , he shall euen powre out the blood thereof , and couer it with dust .
For it is the life of all flesh , the blood of it is for the life thereof : therefore I said vnto the children of Israel , Ye shall not eat the blood of no maner of flesh : for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof : whosoeuer eateth it , shalbe cut off .
And euery soule that eateth that which died of it selfe , or that which was torne with beasts , whether it bee one of your owne countrey , or a stranger , he shall both wash his clothes , and bathe himselfe in water , and be vncleane vntill the Euen : then shall he be cleane .

Defile not you your selues in any of these things : for in all these , the nations are defiled which I cast out before you .
And the land is defiled : Therefore I doe visit the iniquitie thereof vpon it , and the land it selfe vomiteth out her inhabitants .
Ye shall therefore keepe my Statutes and my Iudgements , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your owne nation , nor any stranger that soiourneth among you :

No man that hath a blemish , of the seed of Aaron the Priest , shall come nigh to offer the offrings of the Lord made by fire : he hath a blemish ; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God .
He shall eat the bread of his God , both of the most Holy , and of the holy :

The soule which hath touched any such , shalbe vncleane vntill Euen , and shall not eate of the holy things , vnlesse he wash his flesh with water .
And when the Sunne is downe , he shall be cleane , and shall afterward eate of the holy things , because it is his food .

But whatsoeuer hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
And whosoeuer offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings vnto the Lord , to accomplish his vow , or a free will offring in beeues or sheepe , it shalbe perfect , to be accepted : there shall be no blemish therein .
Blind , or broken , or maimed , or hauing a wenne , or scuruie , or scabbed , ye shal not offer these vnto the Lord , nor make an offring by fire of them vpon the Altar vnto the Lord .
Either a bullocke , or a lambe that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts , that mayest thou offer for a free will offring : but for a vow it shal not be accepted .

Neither from a strangers hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and blemishes bee in them : they shall not be accepted for you .

When a bullocke , or a sheepe , or a goat is brought forth , then it shall bee seuen dayes vnder the damme , and from the eight day and thencefoorth , it shal be accepted for an offering made by fire vnto the Lord .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses in Mount Sinai , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , and say vnto them : when yee come into the land which I giue you , then shall the land keepe a Sabbath vnto the Lord .
Sixe yeeres thou shalt sow thy field , and sixe yeeres thou shalt prune thy Uineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof .
But in the seuenth yeere shalbe a Sabbath of rest vnto the land , a Sabbath for the Lord : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy Uineyard .
And for thy cattel , and for the beast that are in thy land , shall all the encrease thereof be meat .
¶ And thou shalt number seuen Sabbaths of yeeres vnto thee , seuen times seuen yeeres , and the space of the seuen Sabbaths of yeeres , shall be vnto thee fourtie and nine yeeres .
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Iubile to sound , on the tenth day of the seuenth moneth ; in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth yeere , and proclaime libertie throughout all the land , vnto al the inhabitants thereof : It shalbe a Iubile vnto you , and ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession , and ye shall returne euery man vnto his family .
A Iubile shall that fiftieth yeere be vnto you : Ye shall not sow , neither reape that which groweth of it selfe in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy Uine vndressed .
For it is the Iubile , it shall be holy vnto you : ye shall eate the encrease thereof out of the field .
In the yeere of this Iubile yee shall returne euery man vnto his possession .
According to the multitude of yeeres , thou shalt encrease the price thereof , and according to the fewnesse of yeeres , thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the yeeres of the fruites doeth hee sell vnto thee .
Yee shall not therefore oppresse one another ; but thou shalt feare thy God : For I am the Lord your God .
¶ Wherefore ye shall do my Statutes , and keepe my Iudgements , and doe them , and ye shall dwell in the land in safetie .
And the land shall yeeld her fruit , and ye shal eat your fill , and dwell therin in safetie .
And if ye shall say , What shall we eate the seuenth yeere ? Behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase :
Then I will command my blessing vpon you in the sixt yeere , and it shall bring forth fruit for three yeeres .
And ye shall sow the eight yeere , and eat yet of old fruit , vntill the ninth yeere : vntill her fruits come in , ye shall eate of the old store .
¶ The land shall not be sold for euer : for the land is mine , for ye were strangers and soiourners with me .
And in all the land of your possession , ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
¶ If thy brother be waxen poore , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kinne come to redeeme it , then shall hee redeeme that which his brother sold .
And if the man haue none to redeeme it , and himselfe bee able to redeeme it :
Then let him count the yeeres of the sale therof , and restore the ouerplus vnto the man , to whom he sold it , that he may returne vnto his possession .
But if he be not able to restore it to him , then that which is sold , shall remaine in the hand of him that hath bought it , vntill the yeere of Iubile : and in the Iubile it shall goe out , and he shall returne vnto his possession .
And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled citie , then he may redeeme it within a whole yeere after it is solde : within a full yeere may he redeeme it .
And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full yeere , then the house that is in the walled citie , shall be stablished for euer to him that bought it , throughout his generations : it shall not goe out in the Iubile .
But the houses of the villages which haue no walles round about them , shall bee counted as the fields of the countrey : they may ee redeemed , and they shall goe out in the Iubile .
Notwithstanding , the cities of the Leuites , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the Leuites redeeme at any time .
And if a man purchase of the Leuites , then the house that was sold , and the citie of his possession shall goe out in the yeere of Iubile : for the houses of the cities of the Leuites are their possession among the children of Israel .
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold , for it is their perpetuall possession .
¶ And if thy brother bee waxen poore , and fallen in decay with thee , then thou shalt relieue him , yea though he be a stranger , or a soiourner , that hee may liue with thee .
Take thou no vsurie of him , or increase : but feare thy God , that thy brother may liue with thee .
Thou shalt not giue him thy money vpon vsurie , nor lend him thy victuals for increase .
But as an hired seruant , and as a soiourner he shall be with thee , and shall serue thee vnto the yere of Iubile .
And then shall hee depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall returne vnto his owne familie , and vnto the possession of his fathers shall he returne .
For they are my seruants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as bond men .
Thou shalt not rule ouer him with rigour , but shalt feare thy God . Both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaids , which thou shalt haue , shall be of the Heathen , that are round about you : of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
Moreouer , of the children of the strangers that do soiourne among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land : and they shalbe your possession .
And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherite them for a possession , they shal bee your bondmen for euer : but ouer your brethren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one ouer another with rigour .
¶ And if a soiourner or stranger waxe rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by him waxe poore , and sell himselfe vnto the stranger or soiourner by thee , or to the stocke of the strangers family :
After that he is sold , hee may be redeemed againe : one of his brethren may redeeme him .
And if hee be not redeemed in these yeeres , then he shall goe out in the yeere of Iubile , both he , and his children with him .

I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that yee should not be their bondmen , & I haue broken the bandes of your yoke , and made you go vpright .
¶ But if ye will not hearken vnto me , and will not doe all these Commandements :
And if ye shall despise my Statutes , or if your soule abhorre my Iudgements , so that ye wil not doe all my Commandements , but that yee breake my Couenant :
I also will doe this vnto you , I will euen appoint ouer you terrour , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seede in vaine , for your enemies shall eate it .

¶ And if ye walke contrary vnto me , and will not hearken vnto mee , I will bring seuen times moe plagues vpon you , according to your sinnes .
I will also send wilde beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattell , and make you few in number , and your high wayes shall be desolate .
And if ye will not be reformed by these things , but will walke contrary vnto me :
Then will I also walke contrary vnto you , and will punish you yet seuen times for your sinnes .

Then shall the lande enioy her Sabbaths , as long as it lieth desolate , and yee be in your enemies land , euen then shall the land rest , and enioy her Sabbaths .
As long as it lieth desolate , it shall rest : because it did not rest in your Sabbaths , when ye dwelt vpon it .
And vpon them that are left aliue of you , I will send a faintnesse into their hearts in the lands of their enemies , and the sound of a shaken leafe shall chase them , and they shall flee , as fleeing from a sword : and they shall fall , when none pursueth .
And they shall fall one vpon another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth : and yee shall haue no power to stand before your enemies .
And yee shall perish among the Heathen , and the land of your enemies shall eate you vp .
And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquitie in your enemies lands , and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
If they shall confesse the iniquitie of their fathers , with their trespasse which they trespassed against me , and that also they haue walked contrary vnto me :
And that I also haue walked contrary vnto them , and haue brought them into the land of their enemies : if then their vncircumcised hearts bee humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquitie :
Then will I remember my couenant with Iacob , and also my couenant with Isaac , and also my couenant with Abraham will I remember , and I will remember the land .
The land also shalbe left of them , and shall enioy her Sabbaths , while she lieth desolate without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquitie : because , euen because they despised my Iudgements , and because their soule abhorred my Statutes
And yet for all that , when they be in the land of their enemies , I will not cast them away , neither will I abhorre them , to destroy them vtterly , and to breake my couenant with them : for I am the Lord their God .
But I wil for their sakes remember the couenant of their Ancestours , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt , in the sight of the Heathen , that I might be their God : I am the Lord .

But if he bee poorer then thy estimation , then he shall present himselfe before the Priest , and the Priest shall value him : according to his abilitie that vowed , shall the Priest value him .
And if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering vnto the Lord , all that any man giueth of such vnto the Lord , shall be holy .
He shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : And if hee shall at all change beast for beast , then it , and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
And if it be any vncleane beast , of which they doe not offer a sacrifice vnto the Lord , then he shall present the beast before the Priest :
And the Priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valuest it who art the Priest : so shall it be .
But if hee will at all redeeme it , then he shall adde a fift part thereof vnto thy estimation .
¶ And when a man shall sanctifie his house to be holy vnto the Lord , then the Priest shal estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the Priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .

If hee sanctifie his field from the yeere of Iubile , according to thy estimation it shall stand .
And if a man sanctifie vnto the Lord a field which he hath bought , which is not of the fieldes of his possession :
Then the Priest shall reckon vnto him the worth of thy estimation , euen vnto the yeere of the Iubile , and hee shall giue thine estimation in that day , as a holy thing vnto the Lord .
In the yeere of the Iubile , the field shall returne vnto him of whom it was bought , euen to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuarie : twentie Gerahs shall bee the shekel .

Forasmuch as many haue taken in hande to set foorth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely beleeued among vs ,
Euen as they deliuered them vnto vs , which from the beginning were eye - witnesses , & ministers of the word :
It seemed good to me also , hauing had perfect vnderstanding of things from the very first , to write vnto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
That thou mightest know the certainetie of those things wherein thou hast bene instructed .
¶ There was in the dayes of Herode the king of Iudea , a certaine Priest , named Zacharias , of the course of Abia , and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the Commandements and ordinances of the Lord , blamelesse .
And they had no childe , because that Elizabeth was barren , and they both were now well striken in yeeres .
And it came to passe , that while he executed the Priests office before God in the order of his course ,
According to the custome of the Priests office , his lot was to burne incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord .
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without , at the time of incense .
And there appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the Altar of incense .
And when Zacharias sawe him , hee was troubled , and feare fell vpon him .
But the Angel said vnto him , Feare not , Zacharias , for thy prayer is heard , and thy wife Elizabeth shall beare thee a sonne , and thou shalt call his name Iohn .
And thou shalt haue ioy and gladnesse , and many shall reioyce at his birth :
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shal drinke neither wine , nor strong drinke , and he shall bee filled with the holy Ghost , euen from his mothers wombe .
And many of the children of Israel shall hee turne to the Lord their God .
And hee shall goe before him in the spirit and power of Elias , to turne the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisedome of the iust , to make ready a people prepared for the Lord .
And Zacharias said vnto the Angel , Whereby shall I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife well striken in yeeres .
And the Angel answering , said vnto him , I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God , and am sent to speake vnto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
And behold , thou shalt be dumbe , and not able to speake , vntill the day that these things shall bee performed , because thou beleeuest not my words , which shall bee fulfilled in their season .
And the people waited for Zacharias , and maruelled that hee taried so long in the temple .
And after those dayes his wife Elizabeth conceiued , and hid her selfe fiue moneths , saying ,
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the dayes wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproch among men .
And in the sixt moneth , the Angel Gabriel was sent from God , vnto a citie of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
To a virgine espoused to a man whose name was Ioseph , of the house of Dauid , and the virgins name was Marie .
And the Angel said vnto her , Feare not , Marie , for thou hast found fauour with God .
And behold , thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe , and bring forth a sonne , and shalt call his name Iesus .
He shall be great , and shall be called the sonne of the Highest , and the Lord God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid .
And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer , and of his kingdome there shall be no end .
Then said Marie vnto the Angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ?
And the Angel answered and said vnto her , The holy Ghost shall come vpon thee , and the power of the Highest shall ouershadow thee . Therefore also that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee , shall bee called the sonne of God .
And behold , thy cousin Elizabeth , she hath also conceiued a sonne in her old age , and this is the sixt moneth with her , who was called barren .
For with God no thing shall be vnpossible .
And Marie said , Behold the handmaide of the Lord , be it vnto me according to thy word : and the Angel departed from her .
And Marie arose in those dayes , and went into the hill countrey with haste , into a citie of Iuda ,
And entred into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elizabeth .
And it came to passe that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Marie , the babe leaped in her wombe , and Elizabeth was filled with the holy Ghost .
And she spake out with a loud voyce , and saide , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruite of thy wombe .
And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to mee ?
For loe , assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares , the babe leaped in my wombe for ioy .
And blessed is she that beleeued , for there shalbe a performance of those things , which were told her from the Lord .
And Marie said , My soule doth magnifie the Lord .
And my spirit hath reioyced in God my sauiour .
For hee hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for behold , from hencefoorth all generations shall call me blessed .
For he that is mighty hath done to mee great things , and holy is his Name .
And his mercy is on them that feare him , from generation to generation .
Hee hath shewed strength with his arme , he hath scattered the proud , in the imagination of their hearts .
He hath put downe the mighty from their seates , and exalted them of low degree .
Hee hath filled the hungry with good things , and the rich hee hath sent emptie away . Hee hath holpen his seruant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ,
As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for euer .
And Mary abode with her about three moneths , and returned to her owne house .
Now Elizabeths full time came , that shee should be deliuered , and shee brought foorth a sonne .
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy vpon her , and they reioyced with her .
And it came to passe that on the eight day they came to circumcise the childe , and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
And his mother answered , and said , Not so , but he shalbe called Iohn .
And they said vnto her , There is none of thy kinred that is called by this name .
And they made signes to his father , how he would haue him called .
And he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , His name is Iohn : and they marueiled all .
And his mouth was opened immediatly , and his tongue loosed , and hee spake , and praised God .
And feare came on all that dwelt round about them , and all these sayings were noised abroad thorowout all the hill countrey of Iudea .
And all they that had heard them , layde them vp in their hearts , saying , What maner of childe shal this be ? And the hand of the Lord was with him .
And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel , for hee hath visited and redeemed his people ,
And hath raised vp an horne of saluation for vs , in the house of his seruant Dauid ,
As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets , which haue bene since the world began :
That wee should be saued from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate vs ,
In holinesse and righteousnesse before him , all the dayes of our life .
And thou childe shalt bee called the Prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord to prepare his wayes .
To giue knowledge of saluation vnto his people , by the remission of their sinnes ,
Through the tender mercy of our God , whereby the day - spring from on high hath visited vs ,
To giue light to them that sit in darknes , and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace .

And it came to passe in those dayes , that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus , that all the world should be taxed .
( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was gouernor of Syria )
And all went to bee taxed , euery one into his owne citie .
And Ioseph also went vp from Galilee , out of the citie of Nazareth , into Iudea , vnto the citie of Dauid , which is called Bethlehem , ( because he was of the house and linage of Dauid , )
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
And so it was , that while they were there , the dayes were accomplished that she should be deliuered .
And she brought foorth her first borne sonne , and wrapped him in swadling clothes , and laid him in a manger , because there was no roome for them in the Inne .
And there were in the same countrey shepheards abiding in the field , keeping watch ouer their flocke by night .
And loe , the Angel of the Lord came vpon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them , and they were sore afraid .
And the Angel said vnto them , Feare not : For behold , I bring you good tidings of great ioy , which shall be to all people .
For vnto you is borne this day , in the citie of Dauid , a Sauiour , which is Christ the Lord .
And this shall be a signe vnto you ; yee shall find the babe wrapped in swadling clothes lying in a manger .
And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heauenly hoste praising God , and saying ,
Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good wil towards men .
And it came to passe , as the Angels were gone away from them into heauen , the shepheards said one to another , Let vs now goe euen vnto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to passe , which the Lord hath made knowen vnto vs .
And they came with haste , and found Mary and Ioseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
And when they had seene it , they made knowen abroad the saying , which was told them , concerning this child .
And all they that heard it , wondered at those things , which were tolde them by the shepheards .
But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
And the shepheards returned , glorifying & praising God for all the things that they had heard and seene , as it was told vnto them .
And when eight dayes were accomplished for the circumcising of the childe , his name was called Iesus , which was so named of the Angel before he was conceiued in the wombe .
And when the dayes of her purification according to the law of Moses , were accomplished , they brought him to Hierusalem , to present him to the Lord ,
( As it is written in the law of the Lord , Euery male that openeth the wombe , shalbe called holy to the Lord )
And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord , a paire of turtle doues , or two yong pigeons .
And behold , there was a man in Hierusalem , whose name was Simeon , and the same man was iust and deuout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the holy Ghost was vpon him .
And it was reuealed vnto him by the holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seene the Lords Christ .
And hee came by the spirit into the Temple : and when the parents brought in the child Iesus , to doe for him after the custome of the Lawe ,
Then tooke hee him vp in his armes , and blessed God , and said ,
Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace , according to thy word .
For mine eyes haue seene thy saluation .
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people .
A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
And Ioseph and his mother marueiled at those things which were spoken of him .
And Simeon blessed them , and said vnto Marie his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising againe of many in Israel : and for a signe which shall be spoken against ,
( Yea a sword shall pearce thorow thy owne soule also ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be reuealed .
And there was one Anna a Prophetesse , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser ; she was of a great age , and had liued with an husband seuen yeeres from her virginitie .
And she was a widow of about fourescore and foure yeeres , which departed not from the Temple , but serued God with fastings and prayers night and day .
And she comming in that instant , gaue thankes likewise vnto the Lord , and spake of him to al them that looked for redemption in Hierusalem .
And when they had performed all things according to the Lawe of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their owne citie Nazareth .
And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisedome , and the grace of God was vpon him . Now his parents went to Hierusalem euery yeere , at the feast of the Passeouer .
And when he was twelue yeeres old , they went vp to Hierusalem , after the custome of the feast .
And when they had fulfilled the dayes , as they returned , the childe Iesus taried behind in Hierusalem , and Ioseph and his mother knew not of it .
But they supposing him to haue bene in the company , went a daies iourney , and they sought him among their kinsefolke and acquaintance .
And when they found him not , they turned backe againe to Hierusalem , seeking him .
And it came to passe , that after three daies they found him in the Temple , sitting in the midst of the Doctours , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
And all that heard him were astonished at his vnderstanding , and answeres .
And when they sawe him , they were amazed : and his mother said vnto him , Sonne , why hast thou thus dealt with vs ? Behold , thy father and I haue sought thee sorrowing .
And he said vnto them , How is it that ye sought me ? Wist yee not that I must bee about my fathers businesse ?
And they vnderstood not the saying which he spake vnto them .
And he went downe with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subiect vnto them : But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .

Now in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Cesar , Pontius Pilate being Gouernour of Iudea , & Herode being Tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip Tetrarch of Iturea , and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias the Tetrarch of Abilene ,
Annas and Caiaphas being the high Priests , the word of God came vnto Iohn the sonne of Zacharias , in the wildernesse .
And he came into all the countrey about Iordane , preaching the baptisme of repentance , for the remission of sinnes ,
As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the Prophet , saying , The voyce of one crying in the wildernesse , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
Euery valley shall be filled , and euery mountaine and hill shalbe brought low , and the crooked shall bee made straight , and the rough wayes shall be made smooth .
And all flesh shal see the saluation of God .
Then said hee to the multitude that came forth to bee baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
Bring forth therfore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within your selues , We haue Abraham to our father : For I say vnto you , that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham .
And now also the axe is laid vnto the root of the trees : Euery tree therefore which bringeth not foorth good fruit , is hewen downe , and cast into the fire .
And the people asked him , saying , What shall we doe then ?
He answereth , and saith vnto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none , and he that hath meat , let him doe likewise .
Then came also Publicanes to be baptized , and said vnto him , Master , what shall we doe ?
And he said vnto them , Exact no more then that which is appointed you .
And the souldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we doe ? And he said vnto them , Doe violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely , & be content with your wages .
And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of Iohn , whether he were the Christ or not :
Iohn answered , saying vnto them all , I indeede baptize you with water , but one mightier then I commeth , the latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to vnloose , he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost , and with fire .
Whose fanne is in his hand , and he will thorowly purge his floore , and will gather the wheat into his garner , but the chaffe he will burne with fire vnquencheable .
And many other things in his exhortation preached he vnto the people .
But Herode the Tetrarch being reprooued by him for Herodias his brother Philips wife , and for all the euils which Herode had done ,
Added yet this aboue all , that he shut vp Iohn in prison .
Now when all the people were baptized , and it came to passe that Iesus also being baptized , and praying , the heauen was opened :

Being fourtie dayes tempted of the deuil , and in those dayes he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungred .
And the deuil saide vnto him , If thou be the Sonne of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
And Iesus answered him , saying , It is written , that man shall not liue by bread alone , but by euery word of God .
And the deuil taking him vp into an high mountaine , shewed vnto him all the kingdomes of the world in a moment of time .
And the deuil said vnto him , All this power will I giue thee , and the glory of them ; for that is deliuered vnto me , & to whomsoeuer I will , I giue it .
And hee brought him to Hierusalem , and set him on a pinacle of the Temple , and said vnto him , If thou be the Sonne of God , cast thy selfe downe from hence .
For it is written , He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee , to keepe thee .
And in their handes they shall beare thee vp , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
And Iesus answering , said vnto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
And when the deuil had ended all the temptation , hee departed from him for a season .
¶ And Iesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee , and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
And hee taught in their Synagogues , being glorified of all .
¶ And hee came to Nazareth , where he had bene brought vp , and as his custome was , he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood vp for to reade .
And there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Prophet Esaias , and when he had opened the Booke , he found the place where it was written ,
The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee , because hee hath anointed mee , to preach the Gospel to the poore , he hath sent mee to heale the broken hearted , to preach deliuerance to the captiues , and recouering of sight to the blinde , to set at libertie them that are bruised ,
To preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord .
And he closed the booke , and hee gaue it againe to the minister , and sate downe : and the eyes of all them that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him .
And hee began to say vnto them , This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares .
And all bare him witnesse , and wondered at the gracious wordes , which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Iosephs sonne ?
And hee said vnto them , Yee will surely say vnto me this prouerbe , Physition , heale thy selfe : Whatsoeuer wee haue heard done in Capernaum , doe also here in thy countrey .
And hee said , Verely I say vnto you , no Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey .
But I tell you of a trueth , many widowes were in Israel in the dayes of Elias , when the heauen was shut vp three yeres and sixe moneths : when great famine was throughout all the land :
But vnto none of them was Elias sent , saue vnto Sarepta a citie of Sidon , vnto a woman that was a widow .
And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elizeus the Prophet : and none of them was cleansed , sauing Naaman the Syrian .
And all they in the Synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
And rose vp , and thrust him out of the citie , & led him vnto the brow of the hill ( whereon their city was built ) that they might cast him downe headlong .
But he passing thorow the mids of them , went his way :
And came downe to Capernaum , a citie of Galile , and taught them on the Sabbath dayes .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his worde was with power .
¶ And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill , and cryed out with a loud voice ,
Saying , Let vs alone , what haue wee to doe with thee , thou Iesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy vs ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
And Iesus rebuked him , saying , Holde thy peace , and come out of him . And when the deuill had throwen him in the middes , hee came out of him , and hurt him not .
And they were all amazed , and spake among themselues , saying , What a word is this ? for with authoritie and power hee commaundeth the vncleane spirits , and they come out .
And the fame of him went out into euery place of the countrey round about .
¶ And he arose out of the Synagogue , and entred into Simons house : and Simons wiues mother was taken with a great feuer , and they besought him for her .
And he stood ouer her , and rebuked the feuer , & it left her . And immediatly she arose , & ministred vnto them .
¶ Now when the Sunne was setting , all they that had any sicke with diuers diseases , brought them vnto him : and hee laid his handes on euery one of them , and healed them .
And deuils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Sonne of God . And hee rebuking them , suffered them not to speake : for they knewe that hee was Christ .
And when it was day , he departed , and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came vnto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
And hee said vnto them , I must preach the kingdome of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent .

And it came to passe , that as the people preassed vpon him to heare the word of God , hee stood by the lake of Genesareth ,
And sawe two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
And he entred into one of the ships , which was Simons , and prayed him , that he would thrust out a little from the land : and he sate downe , and taught the people out of the ship .
Now when he had left speaking , he said vnto Simon , Lanch out into the deepe , and let downe your nets for a draught .
And Simon answering , said vnto him , Master , wee haue toiled all the night , and haue taken nothing : neuerthelesse at thy word I will let downe the net .
And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes , and their net brake :
And they beckened vnto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and helpe them . And they came , & filled both the ships , so that they began to sinke .
When Simon Peter saw it , he fell downe at Iesus knees , saying , Depart from me , for I am a sinfull man , O Lord .
For he was astonished , and al that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken .
And so was also Iames , and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Iesus said vnto Simon , Feare not , from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsooke all , and followed him .
¶ And it came to passe , when he was in a certaine citie , behold a man full of leprosie : who seeing Iesus , fell on his face , & besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me cleane .
And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I wil : be thou cleane . And immediatly the leprosie departed from him .
And hee charged him to tell no man : but , Goe , and shewe thy selfe to the Priest , and offer for thy clensing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimonie vnto them .
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him , and great multitudes came together to heare , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
¶ And he withdrew himselfe into the wildernesse , and prayed .
And it came to passe on a certaine day , as hee was teaching , that there were Pharisees and Doctours of the Law sitting by , which were come out of euery towne of Galilee , and Iudea , and Hierusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heale them .
¶ And behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsie : and they sought meanes to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in , because of the multitude , they went vpon the house top , & let him downe through the tiling with his couch , into the midst before Iesus .
And when he saw their faith , hee said vnto him , Man , thy sinnes are forgiuen thee .
And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgiue sinnes , but God alone ?
But when Iesus perceiued their thoughts , he answering , saide vnto them , What reason ye in your hearts ?
Whether is easier to say , Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee : or to say , Rise vp and walke ?
But that ye may know that the Sonne of man hath power vpon earth to forgiue sinnes ( he said vnto the sicke of the palsie , ) I say vnto thee , Arise , and take vp thy couch , and go into thine house .
And immediatly he rose vp before them , and tooke vp that whereon hee lay , and departed to his owne house , glorifying God .
And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with feare , saying , Wee haue seene strange things to day .
¶ And after these things hee went foorth , and sawe a Publicane , named Leui , sitting at the receit of custome : and hee said vnto him , Follow me .
And he left all , rose vp , and followed him .
And Leui made him a great feast in his owne house : and there was a great company of Publicanes , and of others that sate downe with them .
But their Scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why doe ye eate and drinke with Publicanes and sinners ?
And Iesus answering , said vnto them , They that are whole need not a physician : but they that are sicke .
I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
¶ And they said vnto him , Why doe the disciples of Iohn fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees : but thine eat and drinke ?
And he said vnto them , Can yee make the children of the Bride - chamber fast , while the Bridegrome is with them ?
But the dayes will come , when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those dayes .
¶ And he spake also a parable vnto them , No man putteth a piece of a newe garment vpon an olde : if otherwise , then both the newe maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new , agreeth not with the olde . And no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
But newe wine must be put into newe bottles , and both are preserued .

And it came to passe on the second Sabbath after the first , that he went thorow the corne fields : and his disciples plucked the eares of corne , and did eate , rubbing them in their hands .
And certaine of the Pharisees said vnto them , Why doe yee that which is not lawfull to doe on the Sabbath dayes ?
And Iesus answering them , said , Haue yee not read so much as this what Dauid did , when himselfe was an hungred , and they which were with him :
How he went into the house of God , and did take and eate the Shew bread , and gaue also to them that were with him , which it is not lawful to eate but for the Priests alone ?
And he said vnto them , That the sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath .
And it came to passe also on another Sabbath , that he entred into the Synagogue , and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
And the Scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heale on the Sabbath day : that they might find an accusation against him .
But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise vp , and stand foorth in the mids . And he arose , and stood foorth .
Then said Iesus vnto them , I will aske you one thing , Is it lawfull on the Sabbath dayes to doe good , or to doe euill ? to saue life , or to destroy it ?
And looking round about vpon them all , he said vnto the man , Stretch foorth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
And they were filled with madnesse , and communed one with another what they might doe to Iesus .
And it came to passe in those dayes , that hee went out into a mountaine to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
¶ And when it was day , he called vnto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelue ; whom also hee named Apostles :
Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother : Iames and Iohn , Philip and Bartholomew ,
Matthew and Thomas , Iames the sonne of Alpheus , and Simon , called Zelotes ,
And Iudas the brother of Iames , and Iudas Iscariot , which also was the traitour .
¶ And hee came downe with them , and stood in the plaine , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people , out of all Iudea and Hierusalem , and from the Sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to heare him , and to be healed of their diseases ,
And they that were vexed with vncleane spirits : and they were healed .
And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went vertue out of him , and healed them all .
¶ And hee lifted vp his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be yee poore : for yours is the kingdome of God .
Blessed are yee that hunger now : for yee shall be filled . Blessed are yee that weepe now , for yee shall laugh .
Blessed are yee when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shal reproach you , and cast out your name as euill , for the Sonne of mans sake .
Reioice yee in that day , and leape for ioy : for behold , your reward is great in heauen for in the like maner did their fathers vnto the Prophets .
But woe vnto you that are rich : for yee haue receiued your consolation .
Woe vnto you that are full : for yee shall hunger . Woe vnto you that laugh now : for yee shall mourne and weepe .
Woe vnto you when all men shall speake well of you : for so did their fathers to the false Prophets .
¶ But I say vnto you which heare , Loue your enemies , doe good to them which hate you ,
Blesse them that curse you , & pray for them which despitefully vse you .
And vnto him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke , offer also the other : and him that taketh away thy cloake , forbid not to take thy coat also .
Giue to euery man that asketh of thee , and of him that taketh away thy goods , aske them not againe .
And as yee would that men should doe to you , doe yee also to them likewise .
For if yee loue them which loue you , what thanke haue ye ? for sinners also loue those that loue them .
And if ye doe good to them which doe good to you , What thanke haue ye ? for sinners also doe euen the same .
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiue , What thanke haue ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receiue as much againe .
But loue yee your enemies , and doe good , and lend , hoping for nothing againe : and your reward shall bee great , and ye shalbe the children of the Highest : for hee is kinde vnto the vnthankfull , and to the euill .
Be ye therefore mercifull , as your Father also is mercifull .
Iudge not , and ye shall not bee iudged : condemne not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgiue , and ye shall be forgiuen .
Giue , and it shall bee giuen vnto you , good measure , preassed downe , and shaken together , and running ouer , shall men giue into your bosome : for with the same measure that ye mete withall , it shall bee measured to you againe .
And hee spake a parable vnto them , Can the blinde leade the blinde ? Shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
The disciple is not aboue his master : but euery one that is perfect shalbe as his master .
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye , but perceiuest not the beame that is in thine owne eye ?
Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let mee pull out the mote that is in thine eye : when thou thy selfe beholdest not the beame that is in thine owne eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beame out of thine owne eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pul out the mote that is in thy brothers eye .
For a good tree bringeth not foorth corrupt fruit : neither doeth a corrupt tree bring foorth good fruit .
For euery tree is knowen by his owne fruit : for of thornes men doe not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart , bringeth foorth that which is good : and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart , bringeth foorth that which is euill : For of the abundance of the heart , his mouth speaketh .
¶ And why call ye mee Lord , Lord , and doe not the things which I say ?
Whosoeuer commeth to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like .
He is like a man which built an house , and digged deepe , and layd the foundation on a rocke . And when the flood arose , the streame beat vehemently vpon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded vpon a rocke .

Now when hee had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , hee entred into Capernaum .
And a certaine Centurions seruant , who was deare vnto him , was sicke and ready to die .
And when he heard of Iesus , he sent vnto him the Elders of the Iewes , beseeching him that he would come and heale his seruant .
And when they came to Iesus , they besought him instantly , saying , that hee was worthy for whome hee should doe this .
For he loueth our nation , and hee hath built vs a Synagogue .
Then Iesus went with them . And when he was now not farre from the house , the Centurion sent friends to him , saying vnto him , Lord , trouble not thy selfe : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe .
Wherefore neither thought I my selfe worthy to come vnto thee : but say in a worde , and my seruant shall bee healed .
For I also am a man set vnder authoritie , hauing vnder mee souldiers : and I say vnto one , Goe , and he goeth : and to another , Come , and hee commeth : and to my seruant , Doe this , and he doeth it .
When Iesus heard these things , hee marueiled at him , and turned him about , and saide vnto the people that followed him , I say vnto you , I haue not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the seruant whole that had bene sicke .
¶ And it came to passe the day after , that he went into a citie called Naim : and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the citie , behold , there was a dead man caried out , the onely sonne of his mother , and shee was a widow : and much people of the citie was with her .
And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and saide vnto her , Weepe not .
And hee came and touched the beere ( and they that bare him , stood still . ) And he said , Yong man , I say vnto thee , Arise .
And he that was dead , sate vp , and began to speake : and he deliuered him to his mother .
And there came a feare on all , and they glorified God , saying , that a great Prophet is risen vp among vs , and that God hath visited his people .
And this rumour of him went foorth throughout all Iudea , and throughout all the region round about . And the disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these things .
¶ And Iohn calling vnto him two of his disciples , sent them to Iesus , saying , Art thou hee that should come , or looke we for another ?
When the men were come vnto him , they said , Iohn Baptist hath sent vs vnto thee , saying , Art thou hee that should come , or looke we for another ?
And in that same houre hee cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of euill spirits , and vnto many that were blind , he gaue sight .
Then Iesus answering , said vnto them , Go your way , and tell Iohn what things ye haue seene and heard , how that the blind see , the lame walke , the lepers are clensed , the deafe heare , the dead are raised , to the poore the Gospel is preached .
And blessed is he whosoeuer shall not be offended in me .
¶ And when the messengers of Iohn were departed , hee beganne to speake vnto the people concerning Iohn : What went ye out into the wildernesse for to see ? A reede shaken with the winde ?
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and liue delicately , are in kings courts .
But what went ye out for to see ? A Prophet ? Yea , I say vnto you , and much more then a Prophet .
This is he of whome it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
For I say vnto you , among those that are borne of women , there is not a greater Prophet then Iohn the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdome of God , is greater then he .
And all the people that heard him , and the Publicanes , iustified God , being baptized with the baptisme of Iohn .
But the Pharisees and Lawyers reiected the counsell of God against themselues , being not baptized of him .
¶ And the Lord said , whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
They are like vnto children sitting in the market place , & calling one to another , and saying , We haue piped vnto you , and ye haue not danced : wee haue mourned to you , and yee haue not wept .
For Iohn the Baptist came , neither eating bread , nor drinking wine , and ye say , He hath a deuill .
The sonne of man is come , eating , and drinking , and ye say , Behold a gluttonous man , and a wine bibber , a friend of Publicanes and sinners .
But wisedome is iustified of all her children .
¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisees house , and sate downe to meat .
And behold , a woman in the citie which was a sinner , when shee knew that Iesus sate at meat in the Pharisees house , brought an Alabaster boxe of ointment ,
And stood at his feet behind him , weeping , and began to wash his feete with teares , and did wipe them with the haires of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the oyntment .
Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him , saw it , he spake within himselfe , saying , This man , if he were a Prophet , would haue knowen who , and what maner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
And Iesus answering , said vnto him , Simon , I haue somewhat to say vnto thee . And he saith , Master , say on .
There was a certaine creditour , which had two debtors : the one ought fiue hundred pence , and the other fiftie .
And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgaue them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will loue him most ?
Simon answered , and saide , I suppose , that hee to whome he forgaue most . And he said vnto him , Thou hast rightly iudged .
And hee turned to the woman , and said vnto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entred into thine house , thou gauest me no water for my feete : but shee hath washed my feete with teares , and wiped them with the haires of her head .
Thou gauest me no kisse : but this woman , since the time I came in , hath not ceased to kisse my feet .
Mine head with oile thou didst not anoint : but this woman anointed my feet with oyntment .
Wherefore , I say vnto thee , her sinnes , which are many , are forgiuen , for she loued much : but to whom litle is forgiuen , the same loueth litle .
And he said vnto her , Thy sinnes are forgiuen .
And they that sate at meat with him , began to say within themselues , Who is this that forgiueth sinnes also ?

And it came to passe afterward , that he went throughout euery citie and village preaching , and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdome of God : and the twelue were with him ,
And certaine women which had bene healed of euill spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene out of whom went seuen deuils ,
And Ioanna the wife of Chuza , Herods steward , and Susanna , and many others which ministred vnto him of their substance .
¶ And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of euery citie , he spake by a parable :
A Sower went out to sowe his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the wayes side , and it was troden downe , and the foules of the aire deuoured it .
And some fell vpon a rocke , and assoone as it was sprung vp , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
And some fell among thornes , and the thornes sprang vp with it , and choked it .
And other fell on good ground , and sprang vp , and bare fruite an hundred fold . And when hee saide these things , he cryed , He that hath eares to heare , let him heare .
And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ?
And he said , Unto you it is giuen to know the mysteries of the kingdome of God : but to others in parables , that seeing , they might not see , and hearing , they might not vnderstand .
Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
Those by the way side , are they that heare : then commeth the deuil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , least they should beleeue , and be saued .
They on the rocke , are they which when they heare , receiue the word with ioy ; and these haue no roote , which for a while beleeue , and in time of temptation fall away .
And that which fell among thornes , are they , which when they haue heard , goe forth , and are choked with cares and riches , and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruite to perfection .
But that on the good ground , are they , which in an honest and good heart hauing heard the word , keepe it , and bring foorth fruite with patience .
¶ No man when he hath lighted a candle , couereth it with a vessell , or putteth it vnder a bed : but setteth it on a candlesticke , that they which enter in , may see the light .
For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest : neither any thing hid , that shall not be knowen , and come abroad .
Take heede therefore how yee heare : for whosoeuer hath , to him shall bee giuen ; and whosoeuer hath not , from him shall be taken , euen that which he seemeth to haue .
¶ Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the prease .
And it was told him by certaine which saide , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
And hee answered and said vnto them , My mother and my brethren are these which heare the word of God , and doe it .
¶ Now it came to passe on a certaine day , that he went into a ship , with his disciples : and hee said vnto them , Let vs goe ouer vnto the other side of the lake , and they lanched foorth .
But as they sailed , he fell asleepe , and there came downe a storme of wind on the lake , and they were filled with water , and were in ieopardie .
And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he rose , and rebuked the wind , and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calme .
And he saide vnto them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraide wondred , saying one to another , What maner of man is this ? For he commandeth euen the winds and water , and they obey him .
¶ And they arriued at the countrey of the Gadarenes , which is ouer against Galilee .
And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the citie a certaine man which had deuils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombes .
When he saw Iesus , he cried out , and fell downe before him , and with a loud voyce said , What haue I to doe with thee , Iesus , thou sonne of God most high ? I beseech thee torment me not .
( For he had commanded the vncleane spirit to come out of the man : For oftentimes it had caught him , and he was kept bound with chaines , and in fetters : and he brake the bands , and was driuen of the deuil into the wildernesse . )
And Iesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : because many deuils were entred into him .
And they besought him , that he would not command them to goe out into the deepe .
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountaine : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them : and he suffered them .
Then went the deuils out of the man , and entred into the swine : and the herd ran violently downe a steepe place into the lake , and were choked .
When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went , and tolde it in the citie , and in the countrey .
Then they went out to see what was done , and came to Iesus , and found the man , out of whom the deuils were departed , sitting at the feete of Iesus , clothed , and in his right minde : and they were afraid .
They also which saw it , told them by what meanes he that was possessed of the deuils , was healed .
¶ Then the whole multitude of the countrey of the Gadarenes round about , besought him to depart from them , for they were taken with great feare : and he went vp into the ship , and returned back againe .
Now the man , out of whom the deuils were departed , besought him that he might be with him : but Iesus sent him away , saying ,
Returne to thine owne house , and shew how great things God hath done vnto thee . And he went his way , and published throughout the whole citie how great things Iesus had done vnto him .
And it came to passe , that when Iesus was returned , the people gladly receiued him : for they were all waiting for him .
¶ And behold , there came a man named Iairus , and hee was a ruler of the Synagogue , and hee fell downe at Iesus feete , and besought him that hee would come into his house :
For hee had one onely daughter about twelue yeeres of age , and she lay a dying . ( But as hee went the people thronged him .
¶ And a woman hauing an issue of blood twelue yeres , which had spent all her liuing vpon Phisitions , neither could be healed of any ,
Came behinde him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediatly her issue of blood stanched .
And Iesus saide , Who touched mee ? When all denied , Peter and they that were with him , said , Master , the multitude throng thee , and preasse thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
And Iesus saide , Some body hath touched mee : for I perceiue that vertue is gone out of me .
And when the woman saw that she was not hid , shee came trembling , and falling downe before him , shee declared vnto him before all the people , for what cause shee had touched him , and how she was healed immediatly .
And he said vnto her , Daughter , be of good comfort , thy faith hath made thee whole , goe in peace . )
¶ While hee yet spake , there commeth one from the ruler of the Synagogues house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead , trouble not the Master .
But when Iesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Feare not , beleeue onely , and she shalbe made whole .
And they laughed him to scorne , knowing that she was dead .
And hee put them all out , and tooke her by the hand , and called , saying , Mayd , arise .
And her spirit came againe , and shee arose straightway : and hee commanded to giue her meat .
<NON-VERSE>
Then he called his twelue disciples together , and gaue them power and authority ouer all deuils , and to cure diseases .
And hee sent them to preach the Kingdome of God , and to heale the sicke .
And he said vnto them , Take nothing for your iourney , neither staues , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money , neither haue two coates apeece .
And whatsoeuer house yee enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
And whosoeuer will not receiue you , when ye goe out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feete , for a testimonie against them .
And they departed , and went through the townes , preaching the Gospel , and healing euery where .
¶ Now Herode the Tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and hee was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that Iohn was risen from the dead :
And of some , that Elias had appeared : and of others , that one of the olde Prophets was risen againe .
And Herode said , Iohn haue I beheaded : but who is this of whom I heare such things ? And hee desired to see him .
¶ And the Apostles when they were returned , tolde him all that they had done . And hee tooke them , and went aside priuately into a desert place , belonging to the citie called Bethsaida .
And the people when they knew it , followed him , and he receiued them , and spake vnto them of the kingdome of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
And when the day beganne to weare away , then came the twelue , and said vnto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the townes and countrey round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
But he said vnto them , Giue yee them to eate . And they said , Wee haue no more but fiue loaues and two fishes , except we should goe and buy meate for all this people .
For they were about fiue thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit downe by fifties in a company .
And they did so , and made them all sit downe .
Then he tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes , and looking vp to heauen , hee blessed them , and brake , and gaue to the disciples to set before the multitude .
And they did eate , and were all filled . And there was taken vp of fragments that remained to them , twelue baskets .
¶ And it came to passe , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
They answering , said , Iohn the Baptist : but some say , Elias : and others say , that one of the old Prophets is risen againe .
He said vnto them , But whom say yee that I am ? Peter answering , said , The Christ of God .
And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ,
Saying , The Sonne of man must suffer many things , and be reiected of the Elders , and chiefe Priests , and Scribes , and be slaine , and be raised the third day .
¶ And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him denie himselfe , and take vp his crosse daily , and follow me .
For whosoeuer will saue his life , shall lose it : but whosoeuer will lose his life for my sake , the same shall saue it .
For what is a man aduantaged , if hee gaine the whole world , and lose himselfe , or be cast away ?
For whosoeuer shall bee ashamed of me , and of my wordes , of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his owne glory , and in his Fathers , and of the holy Angels .
But I tell you of a trueth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdome of God .
¶ And it came to passe , about an eight dayes after these sayings , hee tooke Peter , and Iohn , and Iames , and went vp into a mountaine to pray :
And as hee prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
And behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias ,
Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease , which he should accomplish at Hierusalem .
But Peter , and they that were with him , were heauie with sleepe : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
And it came to passe , as they departed from him , Peter said vnto Iesus , Master , it is good for vs to be here , and let vs make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and ouershadowed them , & they feared , as they entred into the cloude .
And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloued Son , heare him .
And when the voyce was past , Iesus was found alone , and they kept it close , & told no man in those dayes any of those things which they had seene .
¶ And it came to passe , that on the next day , when they were come downe from the hill , much people met him .
And behold , a man of the companie cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee looke vpon my sonne , for he is mine onely child .
And loe , a spirit taketh him , and hee suddenly crieth out , and it teareth him that he fometh againe , and bruising him , hardly departeth from him .
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out , and they could not .
And Iesus answering , said , O faithlesse , and peruerse generation , how long shal I be with you , and suffer you ? bring thy sonne hither .
And as he was yet a comming , the deuill threw him downe , and tare him : and Iesus rebuked the vncleane spirit , and healed the child , and deliuered him againe to his father .
¶ And they were al amazed at the mightie power of God : But while they wondred euery one at all things which Iesus did , he said vnto his disciples ,
Let these sayings sinke downe into your eares : for the Sonne of man shall bee deliuered into the handes of men .
But they vnderstood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceiued it not : and they feared to aske him of that saying .
¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
And Iesus perceiuing the thought of their heart , tooke a child , and set him by him ,
And said vnto them , Whosoeuer shall receiue this child in my Name , receiueth me : and whosoeuer shal receiue me , receiueth him that sent me : For hee that is least among you all , the same shalbe great .
¶ And Iohn answered , and said , Master , we saw one casting out deuils in thy Name , and we forbade him , because he followeth not with vs .
And Iesus said vnto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against vs , is for vs .
¶ And it came to passe , when the time was come that he should bee receiued vp , he stedfastly set his face to goe to Hierusalem ,
And sent messengers before his face , and they went and entred into a village of the Samaritanes to make ready for him .
And they did not receiue him , because his face was as though he would goe to Hierusalem .
For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues , but to saue them . And they went to another village .
¶ And it came to passe that as they went in the way , a certaine man said vnto him , Lord , I wil follow thee whithersoeuer thou goest .
And Iesus said vnto him , Foxes haue holes , and birds of the aire haue nests , but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head .
And he said vnto another , Follow me : But he said , Lord , suffer mee first to goe and bury my father .
Iesus said vnto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdome of God .
And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee : but let me first goe bid them farewel , which are at home at my house .
<NON-VERSE>
After these things , the Lord appointed other seuenty also , and sent them two and two before his face , into euery citie and place , whither hee himselfe would come .
Therefore said hee vnto them , The haruest truly is great , but the labourers are few ; pray ye therefore the Lord of the haruest , that he would send foorth labourers into his haruest .
Go your wayes : Behold , I send you forth as lambes among wolues .
Cary neither purse nor scrip , nor shoes , and salute no man by the way .
And into whatsoeuer house yee enter , first say , Peace bee to this house .
And if the sonne of peace be there , your peace shall rest vpon it : if not , it shall turne to you againe .
And in the same house remaine , eating and drinking such things as they giue : For the labourer is worthy of his hire . Goe not from house to house .
And into whatsoeuer citie yee enter , and they receiue you , eate such things as are set before you :
And heale the sicke that are therein , and say vnto them , The kingdome of God is come nigh vnto you .
But into whatsoeuer citie yee enter , and they receiue you not , goe your waies out into the streetes of the same , and say ,
Euen the very dust of your citie which cleaueth on vs , we doe wipe off against you : notwithstanding , be yee sure of this , that the kingdome of God is come nigh vnto you .
But I say vnto you , That it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodome , then for that citie .
Woe vnto thee Chorazin , wo vnto thee Bethsaida : For if the mighty workes had beene done in Tyre and Sidon , which haue beene done in you , they had a great while agoe repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the iudgment , then for you .
And thou Capernaum , which art exalted to heauen , shalt be thrust downe to hell .
Hee that heareth you , heareth me : and he that despiseth you , despiseth me : and he that despiseth me , despiseth him that sent me .
¶ And the seuenty returned againe with ioy , saying , Lord , euen the deuils are subiect vnto vs through thy name .
And he said vnto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heauen .
Behold , I giue vnto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and ouer all the power of the enemie : and nothing shall by any meanes hurt you .
Notwithstanding in this reioyce not , that the spirits are subiect vnto you : but rather reioyce , because your names are written in heauen .
¶ In that houre Iesus reioyced in spirit , and said , I thanke thee , O father , Lord of heauen and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast reuealed them vnto babes : euen so father , for so it seemed good in thy sight .
All things are deliuered to me of my father : and no man knoweth who the sonne is , but the father : and who the father is , but the sonne , and he to whom the sonne will reueale him .
¶ And he turned him vnto his disciples , and said priuately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that yee see .
For I tell you , that many Prophets , and kings haue desired to see those things which yee see , and haue not seene them : & to heare those things which yee heare , and haue not heard them .
¶ And behold , a certaine Lawyer stood vp , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I doe to inherite eternall life ? He said vnto him ,
What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
And he answering , said , Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soule , and with all thy strength , and with all thy minde , and thy neighbour as thy selfe .
And he said vnto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt liue .
But he willing to iustifie himselfe , said vnto Iesus , And who is my neighbour ?
And Iesus answering , said , A certaine man went downe from Hierusalem to Iericho , and fel among theeues , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leauing him halfe dead .
And by chaunce there came downe a certaine Priest that way , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
And likewise a Leuite , when hee was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
But a certaine Samaritane as he iourneyed , came where he was ; and when hee saw him , hee had compassion on him ,
And went to him , and bound vp his wounds , powring in oile and wine , and set him on his owne beast , and brought him to an Inne , and tooke care of him .
And on the morrow when he departed , hee tooke out two pence , and gaue them to the hoste , and saide vnto him , Take care of him , and whatsoeuer thou spendest more , when I come againe I will repay thee .
Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues ?
And he said , He that shewed mercie on him . Then said Iesus vnto him , Goe , and doe thou likewise .
¶ Now it came to passe , as they went , that he entred into a certaine village : and a certaine woman named Martha , receiued him into her house .
And shee had a sister called Mary , which also sate at Iesus feet , and heard his word :
But Martha was cumbred about much seruing , and came to him , and said , Lord , doest thou not care that my sister hath left mee to serue alone ? Bid her therefore that she helpe me .
And Iesus answered , and saide vnto her , Martha , Martha , thou art carefull , and troubled about many things :
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , that as he was praying in a certaine place , when hee ceased , one of his disciples said vnto him , Lord , teach vs to pray , as Iohn also taught his disciples .
And hee said vnto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heauen , Halowed be thy Name , Thy kingdome come , Thy will be done as in heauen , so in earth .
Giue vs day by day our dayly bread .
And forgiue vs our sinnes : for we also forgiue euery one that is indebted to vs . And lead vs not into temptation , but deliuer vs from euill .
And he said vnto them , Which of you shall haue a friend , and shall goe vnto him at midnight , and say vnto him , Friend , lend me three loaues .
For a friend of mine in his iourney is come to me , and I haue nothing to set before him ,
And he from within shal answere and say , Trouble mee not , the doore is now shut , and my children are with me in bed : I cannot rise and giue thee .
I say vnto you , Though he will not rise , and giue him , because he is his friend : yet because of his importunitie , hee will rise and giue him as many as he needeth .
And I say vnto you , Aske , and it shalbe giuen you : seeke , and ye shal find : knocke , and it shalbe opened vnto you .
Or if he shall aske an egge , will he offer him a scorpion ?
If ye then , being euill , know how to giue good gifts vnto your children : how much more shall your heauenly Father giue the holy Spirit to them that aske him ?
¶ And he was casting out a deuil , and it was dumbe . And it came to passe , when the deuill was gone out , the dumbe spake : and the people wondred .
But some of them said , Hee casteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of the deuils .
And other tempting him , sought of him a signe from heauen .
But he knowing their thoughts , said vnto them , Euery kingdome diuided against it selfe , is brought to desolation : and a house diuided against a house , falleth .
If Satan also be diuided against himselfe , how shall his kingdom stand ? Because yee say that I cast out deuils through Beelzebub .
And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils , by whom doe your sonnes cast them out ? therefore shall they be your iudges .
But if I with the finger of God cast out deuils , no doubt the kingdome of God is come vpon you .
When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
But when a stronger then he shal come vpon him , and ouercome him , hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and diuideth his spoiles .
He that is not with me , is against me : and hee that gathereth not with me , scattereth .
When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through drie places , seeking rest : and finding none , he sayth , I will returne vnto my house whence I came out .
And when hee commeth , hee findeth it swept and garnished .
Then goeth he , and taketh to him seuen other spirits more wicked then himselfe , and they enter in , and dwell there , and the last state of that man is worse then the first .
¶ And it came to passe as hee spake these things , a certaine woman of the company lift vp her voice , and said vnto him , Blessed is the wombe that bare thee , and the pappes which thou hast sucked .
But hee said , Yea , rather blessed are they that heare the word of God , and keepe it .
¶ And when the people were gathered thicke together , hee began to say , This is an euill generation , they seeke a signe , and there shall no signe be giuen it , but the signe of Ionas the Prophet :
For as Ionas was a signe vnto the Nineuites , so shall also the Sonne of man be to this generation .
The Queene of the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with the men of this generation , & condemne them : for shee came from the vtmost parts of the earth , to heare the wisedome of Solomon : and behold , a greater then Solomon is here .
The men of Nineue shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation , and shall condemne it : for they repented at the preaching of Ionas , and behold , a greater then Ionas is here .
No man when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither vnder a bushell , but on a candlesticke , that they which come in may see the light .
The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light : but when thine eye is euill , thy body also is full of darkenesse .
Take heede therefore , that the light which is in thee , be not darknesse .
If thy whole body therefore be full of light , hauing no part darke , the whole shalbe full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doeth giue thee light .
¶ And as he spake , a certaine Pharise besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sate downe to meate .
And when the Pharise saw it , he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner .
And the Lord said vnto him , Now doe ye Pharises make cleane the outside of the cup and the platter : but your inward part is full of rauening and wickednesse .
Yee fooles , did not he that made that which is without , make that which is within also ?
But rather giue almes of such things as you haue : and behold , all things are cleane vnto you .
But woe vnto you Pharises : for ye tythe Mint and Rue , and all maner of herbes , and passe ouer iudgement , and the loue of God : these ought yee to haue done , and not to leaue the other vndone .
Woe vnto you Pharisees : for ye loue the vppermost seats in the Synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites : for ye are as graues which appeare not , and the men that walk ouer them , are not aware of them .
¶ Then answered one of the Lawyers , and said vnto him , Master , thus saying , thou reprochest vs also .
And he said , Woe vnto you also ye lawyers : for ye lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne , and ye your selues touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
Woe vnto you : for ye build the sepulchres of the Prophets , and your fathers killed them .
Truely ye beare witnesse that ye allowe the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and yee build their sepulchres .
Therefore also said the wisedome of God , I wil send them Prophets and Apostles , and some of them they shal slay and persecute :
That the blood of all the Prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ,
From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias , which perished betweene the Altar and the Temple : Uerely I say vnto you , it shall be required of this generation .
Woe vnto you Lawyers : for ye haue taken away the key of knowledge : ye entred not in your selues , and them that were entring in , ye hindred .
And as he said these things vnto them , the Scribes and the Pharisees began to vrge him vehemently , and to prouoke him to speake of many things :
<NON-VERSE>
In the meane time , when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people , insomuch that they trode one vpon another , he began to say vnto his disciples first of all , Beware yee of the leauen of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisie .
For there is nothing couered , that shall not be reuealed , neither hid , that shall not be knowen .
Therefore , whatsoeuer yee haue spoken in darkenesse , shall bee heard in the light : and that which yee haue spoken in the eare , in closets , shal be proclaimed vpon the house tops .
And I say vnto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that , haue no more that they can doe .
But I will forewarne you whom you shall feare : Feare him , which after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell , yea , I say vnto you , Feare him .
Are not fiue sparrowes solde for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ?
But euen the very haires of your head are all numbred : Feare not therefore , ye are of more value then many sparrowes .
Also I say vnto you , Whosoeuer shall confesse me before men , him shall the Sonne of man also confesse before the Angels of God .
But he that denieth me before men , shalbe denied before the Angels of God .
And whosoeuer shall speake a word against the Sonne of man , it shall be forgiuen him : but vnto him that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost , it shal not be forgiuen .
And when they bring you vnto the Synagogues , and vnto Magistrates , & powers , take yee no thought how or what thing ye shall answere , or what ye shall say :
For the holy Ghost shal teach you in the same houre , what ye ought to say .
¶ And one of the company saide vnto him , Master , speake to my brother , that he diuide the inheritance with me .
And he said vnto him , Man , who made mee a iudge , or a diuider ouer you ?
And he said vnto them , Take heed and beware of couetousnes : for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .
And he spake a parable vnto them , saying , The ground of a certaine rich man brought foorth plentifully .
And he thought within himselfe , saying , What shall I doe , because I haue no roome where to bestow my fruits ?
And he said , This will I doe , I will pull downe my barnes , and build greater , and there will I bestow all my fruits , and my goods .
And I will say to my soule , Soule , thou hast much goods layd vp for many yeeres , take thine ease , eate , drinke , and be merry .
But God said vnto him , Thou foole , this night thy soule shal be required of thee : then whose shal those things be which thou hast prouided ?
So is he that laieth vp treasure for himselfe , and is not rich towards God .
¶ And he said vnto his disciples , Therefore I say vnto you , Take no thought for your life what yee shall eate , neither for the body what yee shall put on .
The life is more then meate , and the body is more then raiment .
Consider the rauens , for they neither sow nor reape , which neither haue storehouse nor barne , and God feedeth them : How much more are yee better then the foules ?
And which of you with taking thought can adde to his stature one cubite ?
If yee then bee not able to doe that thing which is least , why take yee thought for the rest ?
Consider the Lillies how they growe , they toile not ; they spinne not : and yet I say vnto you , that Solomon in all his glory , was not arayed like one of these .
If then God so clothe the grasse , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the ouen : how much more will he clothe you , O ye of litle faith ?
And seeke not yee what yee shall eate , or what ye shall drinke , neither be ye of doubtfull minde .
For all these things doe the nations of the world seeke after : and your father knoweth that yee haue neede of these things .
¶ But rather seeke yee the kingdome of God , and all these things shall be added vnto you .
Feare not , litle flocke , for it is your fathers good pleasure to giue you the kingdome .
Sell that yee haue , and giue almes : prouide your selues bagges which waxe not old , a treasure in the heauens that faileth not , where no theefe approcheth , neither moth corrupteth .
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
Let your loines be girded about , and your lights burning ,
And ye your selues like vnto men that waite for their Lord , when he will returne from the wedding , that when he commeth and knocketh , they may open vnto him immediately .
Blessed are those seruants , whom the Lord when he commeth , shall find watching : Uerily , I say vnto you , That he shall girde himselfe , and make them to sit downe to meate , and will come foorth and serue them .
And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those seruants .
And this know , that if the good man of the house had knowen what houre the theefe would come , he would haue watched , and not haue suffred his house to be broken thorow .
Be yee therefore ready also : for the sonne of man commeth at an houre when yee thinke not .
¶ Then Peter said vnto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable vnto vs , or euen to all ?
And the Lord said , Who then is that faithfull and wise steward , whom his Lord shall make ruler ouer his houshold , to giue them their portion of meate in due season ?
Blessed is that seruant , whom his Lord when he commeth , shall find so doing .
Of a trueth , I say vnto you , that hee will make him ruler ouer all that he hath .
But and if that seruant say in his heart , My Lord delayeth his comming and shall beginne to beat the men seruants , and maidens , and to eate and drinke , and to be drunken :
The Lord of that seruant will come in a day when hee looketh not for him , and at an houre when hee is not ware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the vnbeleeuers .
And that seruant which knew his Lords will , and prepared not himselfe , neither did according to his will , shalbe beaten with many stripes .
But hee that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall bee beaten with few stripes . For vnto whomsoeuer much is giuen , of him shal bee much required : and to whom men haue committed much , of him they will aske the more .
¶ I am come to send fire on the earth , and what will I , if it be already kindled ?
But I haue a baptisme to be baptized with , and how am I straitned till it be accomplished ?
Suppose yee that I am come to giue peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay , but rather diuision .
For from henceforth there shalbe fiue in one house diuided , three against two , and two against three .
The father shall bee diuided against the sonne , and the sonne against the father : the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother : the mother in lawe against her daughter in lawe , and the daughter in law against her mother in lawe .
¶ And he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the West , straightway yee say , There commeth a showre , and so it is .
And when ye see the Southwind blow , ye say , There will be heat , and it commeth to passe .
Ye hypocrites , ye can discerne the face of the skie , and of the earth : but how is it that yee doe not discerne this time ?
Yea , and why euen of your selues iudge ye not what is right ?
¶ When thou goest with thine aduersary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , giue diligence that thou mayest be deliuered from him , lest hee hale thee to the Iudge , and the Iudge deliuer thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
<NON-VERSE>
There were present at that season , some that told him of the Galileans , whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
And Iesus answering , said vnto them , Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners aboue all the Galileans , because they suffered such things ?
I tell you , Nay : but except yee repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
Or those eighteene , vpon whom the towre in Siloe fell , and slew them , thinke ye that they were sinners aboue all men that dwelt in Hierusalem ?
I tell you , Nay ; but except yee repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
¶ Hee spake also this parable , A certaine man had a figtree planted in his Uineyard , and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
Then said hee vnto the dresser of his Uineyard , Beholde , these three yeeres I come seeking fruit on this figtree , and finde none : cut it downe , why cumbreth it the ground ?
And he answering , said vnto him , Lord , let it alone this yeere also , till I shall digge about it , and doung it :
And if it beare fruit , Well : and if not , then after that , thou shalt cut it downe .
And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath .
¶ And beholde , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeeres , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift vp her selfe .
And when Iesus saw her , he called her to him , and said vnto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thy infirmitie .
And hee layd his handes on her , and immediatly she was made straight , and glorified God .
And the ruler of the Synagogue answered with indignation , because that Iesus had healed on the Sabbath day , and said vnto the people , There are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day .
The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doeth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his oxe or his asse from the stall , and leade him away to watering ?
And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , loe these eighteene yeeres , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ?
And when hee had said these things , all his aduersaries were ashamed : & all the people reioyced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
¶ Then said he , Unto what is the kingdome of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
It is like a graine of mustard seed , which a man tooke , and cast into his garden , and it grew , and waxed a great tree : and the foules of the aire lodged in the branches of it .
And againe hee said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God ?
It is like leauen , which a woman tooke and hidde in three measures of meale , till the whole was leauened .
And he went thorow the cities and villages , teaching and iourneying towards Hierusalem .
Then said one vnto him , Lord , are there few that be saued ? And he said vnto them ,
¶ Striue to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say vnto you , will seeke to enter in , and shall not be able .
When once the master of the house is risen vp , & hath shut to the doore , and ye begin to stand without , & to knocke at the doore , saying , Lord , Lord , open vnto vs , and he shal answere , & say vnto you , I know you not whence you are :
Then shall ye begin to say , Wee haue eaten and drunke in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
But he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence you are ; depart from me all ye workers of iniquitie .
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when yee shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Iacob , and all the Prophets in the kingdome of God , and you your selues thrust out .
And they shall come from the East , and from the West , and from the North , and from the South , and shall sit downe in the kingdome of God .
And behold , there are last , which shall be first ; and there are first , which shall be last .
¶ The same day there came certaine of the Pharises , saying vnto him , Get thee out , and depart hence ; for Herode will kill thee .
And he said vnto them , Go ye and tell that Foxe , behold , I cast out deuils , and I doe cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
Neuerthelesse , I must walke to day and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a Prophet perish out of Hierusalem .
O Hierusalem , Hierusalem , which killest the Prophets , and stonest them that are sent vnto thee ; how often would I haue gathered thy children together , as a henne doeth gather her brood vnder her wings , & ye would not ?
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharises to eat bread on the Sabbath day , that they watched him .
And behold , there was a certaine man before him , which had the dropsie .
And Iesus answering , spake vnto the Lawyers and Pharises , saying , Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath day ?
And they held their peace . And he tooke him , and healed him , & let him go ,
And answered them , saying , Which of you shall haue an asse or an oxe fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day ?
And they could not answere him againe to these things .
¶ And he put foorth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked howe they chose out the chiefe roumes , saying vnto them ,
When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not downe in the highest roume : lest a more honourable man then thou be bidden of him ,
And hee that bade thee and him , come , and say to thee , Giue this man place : and thou begin with shame to take the lowest roume .
But when thou art bidden , goe and sit downe in the lowest roume , that when he that bade thee commeth , hee may say vnto thee , Friend , goe vp higher : then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at meate with thee .
For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe , shalbe abased : and hee that humbleth himselfe , shalbe exalted .
¶ Then said hee also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsemen , nor thy rich neighbours , lest they also bid thee againe , and a recompence be made thee .
But when thou makest a feast , call the poore , the maimed , the lame , the blinde ,
And thou shalt be blessed , for they cannot recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the iust .
¶ And when one of them that sate at meate with him , heard these things , he said vnto him , Blessed is hee that shall eate bread in the kingdom of God .
Then said hee vnto him , A certaine man made a great supper , and bade many :
And sent his seruant at supper time , to say to them that were bidden , Come , for all things are now ready .
And they all with one consent began to make excuse : The first said vnto him , I haue bought a piece of ground , and I must needs goe and see it : I pray thee haue me excused .
And another said , I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen , and I goe to prooue them : I pray thee haue me excused .
And another said , I haue maried a wife : and therefore I cannot come .
So that seruant came , and shewed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry , sayde to his seruant , Goe out quickely into the streetes and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poore , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blinde .
And the seruant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is roume .
And the Lord said vnto the seruant , Goe out into the high wayes and hedges , and compell them to come in , that my house may be filled .
For I say vnto you , that none of those men which were bidden , shall taste of my supper .
¶ And there went great multitudes with him : and hee turned , and said vnto them ,
If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea and his owne life also , hee cannot be my disciple .
And whosoeuer doeth not beare his crosse , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
For which of you intending to build a towre , sitteth not downe first , and counteth the cost , whether he haue sufficient to finish it ?
Lest haply after hee hath laide the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it , begin to mock him ,
Saying , This man beganne to build , and was not able to finish .
Or what king going to make war against another king , sitteth not downe first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand , to meete him that commeth against him with twentie thousand ?
Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , hee sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
So likewise , whosoeuer he be of you , that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .
¶ Salt is good : but if the salt haue lost his sauour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then drew neere vnto him all the Publicanes and sinners , for to heare him .
And the Pharises and Scribes murmured , murmured , saying , This man receiueth sinners , and eateth with them .
¶ And he spake this parable vnto them , saying ,
What man of you hauing an hundred sheepe , if he loose one of them , doth not leaue the ninety and nine in the wildernesse , and goe after that which is lost , vntill he find it ?
And when he hath found it , hee layeth it on his shoulders , reioycing .
And when he commeth home , he calleth together his friends , and neighbours , saying vnto them , Reioyce with me , for I haue found my sheepe which was lost .
I say vnto you , that likewise ioy shall be in heauen ouer one sinner that repenteth , more then ouer ninety and nine iust persons , which need no repentance .
¶ Either what woman hauing ten pieces of siluer , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweepe the house , and seeke diligently till shee find it ?
And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Reioyce with me , for I haue found the piece which I had lost .
Likewise I say vnto you , there is ioy in the presence of the Angels of God , ouer one sinner that repenteth .
¶ And hee said , A certaine man had two sonnes :
And the yonger of them said to his father , Father , giue me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he diuided vnto them his liuing .
And not many dayes after , the yonger sonne gathered al together , and tooke his iourney into a farre countrey , and there wasted his substance with riotous liuing .
And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land , and he beganne to be in want .
And he went and ioyned himselfe to a citizen of that countrey , and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
And he would faine haue filled his belly with the huskes that the swine did eate : & no man gaue vnto him .
And when he came to himselfe , he said , How many hired seruants of my fathers haue bread inough and to spare , and I perish with hunger ?
I will arise and goe to my father , and will say vnto him , Father , I haue sinned against heauen and before thee .
And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne : make me as one of thy hired seruants .
And he arose and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ranne , and fell on his necke , and kissed him .
And the sonne said vnto him , Father , I haue sinned against heauen , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy sonne .
But the father saide to his seruants , Bring foorth the best robe , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand , and shooes on his feete .
And bring hither the fatted calfe , and kill it , and let vs eate and be merrie .
For this my sonne was dead , and is aliue againe ; hee was lost , & is found . And they began to be merie .
Now his elder sonne was in the field , and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musicke & dauncing ,
And he called one of the seruants , and asked what these things meant .
And he said vnto him , Thy brother is come , and thy father hath killed the fatted calfe , because he hath receiued him safe and sound .
And he was angry , and would not goe in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him .
And he answering said to his father , Loe , these many yeeres doe I serue thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandement , and yet thou neuer gauest mee a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
But as soone as this thy sonne was come , which hath deuoured thy liuing with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calfe .
And he said vnto him , Sonne , thou art euer with me , and all that I haue is thine .
<NON-VERSE>
And hee said also vnto his disciples , There was a certaine rich man which had a Steward , and the same was accused vnto him that he had wasted his goods .
And hee called him , and said vnto him , How is it that I heare this of thee ? Giue an accompt of thy stewardship : for thou mayest bee no longer Steward .
Then the Steward said within himselfe , What shall I doe , for my lord taketh away from mee the Stewardship ? I cannot digge , to begge I am ashamed .
I am resolued what to doe , that when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receiue me into their houses .
So hee called euery one of his lords detters vnto him , and said vnto the first , How much owest thou vnto my lord ?
And hee said , An hundred measures of oyle . And hee saide vnto him , Take thy bill , and sit downe quickly , and write fiftie .
Then said hee to another , And how much owest thou ? And hee said , An hundred measures of wheat . And hee saide vnto him , Take thy bill and write fourescore .
And the lord commended the vniust Steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser then the children of light .
And I say vnto you , Make to your selues friends of the Mammon of vnrighteousnesse , that when ye faile , they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations .
Hee that is faithfull in that which is least , is faithfull also in much : and he that is vniust in the least , is vniust also in much .
If therefore yee haue not bene faithfull in the vnrighteous Mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
And if ye haue not bene faithful in that which is another mans , who shall giue you that which is your owne ?
¶ No seruant can serue two masters , for either he will hate the one , and loue the other : or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other : yee cannot serue God and Mammon .
And the Pharisees also who were couetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
And he said vnto them , Ye are they which iustifie your selues before men , but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed amongst men , is abomination in the sight of God .
The law and the Prophets were vntill Iohn : since that time the kingdome of God is preached , and euery man preasseth into it .
And it is easier for heauen and earth to passe , then one title of the law to faile .
Whosoeuer putteth away his wife , & marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoeuer marrieth her that is put away from her husband , committeth adultery .
¶ There was a certaine rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linnen , and fared sumptuously euery day .
And there was a certaine begger named Lazarus , which was layde at his gate full of sores ,
And desiring to bee fed with the crummes which fel from the rich mans table : moreouer the dogges came and licked his sores .
And it came to passe that the begger died , and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome : the rich man also died , and was buried .
And in hell he lift vp his eyes being in torments , and seeth Abraham afarre off , and Lazarus in his bosome :
And he cried , and said , Father Abraham , haue mercy on mee , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and coole my tongue , for I am tormented in this flame .
But Abraham saide , Sonne , remember that thou in thy life - time receiuedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus euill things , but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
And besides all this , betweene vs and you there is a great gulfe fixed , so that they which would passe from hence to you , cannot , neither can they passe to vs , that would come from thence .
Then he said , I pray thee therefore father , that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house :
For I haue fiue brethren , that he may testifie vnto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
Abraham saith vnto him , They haue Moses and the Prophets , let them heare them .
And hee said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went vnto them from the dead , they will repent .
<NON-VERSE>
Then said he vnto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come , but wo vnto him through whom they come .
It were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his necke , and he cast into the Sea , then that he should offend one of these little ones .
¶ Take heed to your selues : If thy brother trespasse against thee , rebuke him , and if he repent , forgiue him .
And if hee trespasse against thee seuen times in a day , and seuen times in a day turne againe to thee , saying , I repent , thou shalt forgiue him .
And the Apostles said vnto the Lord , Increase our faith .
And the Lord said , If yee had faith as a graine of mustard seede , yee might say vnto this Sycamine tree , Be thou plucked vp by the root , and be thou planted in the sea , & it should obey you .
But which of you hauing a seruant plowing , or feeding cattell , will say vnto him by & by when he is come from the field , Goe and sit downe to meate ?
And will not rather say vnto him , Make ready wherewith I may suppe , and gird thy selfe , and serue me , till I haue eaten and drunken : and afterward thou shalt eate and drinke .
Doeth he thanke that seruant , because hee did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not .
So likewise ye , when ye shal haue done all those things which are commanded you , say , Wee are vnprofitable seruants : Wee haue done that which was our duety to doe .
¶ And it came to passe , as he went to Hierusalem , that hee passed thorow the mids of Samaria and Galile .
And as he entred into a certaine village , there met him tenne men that were lepers , which stood afarre off .
And they lifted vp their voices , and said , Iesus master haue mercy on vs .
And when he saw them , hee said vnto them , Goe shew your selues vnto the Priests . And it came to passe , that as they went , they were cleansed .
And one of them when hee sawe that he was healed , turned backe , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
And fell downe on his face at his feet , giuing him thanks : and he was a Samaritane .
And Iesus answering , said , Were there not ten cleansed , but where are the nine ?
There are not found that returned to giue glory to God , saue this stranger .
And he said vnto him , Arise , go thy way , thy faith hath made thee whole .
¶ And when hee was demanded of the Pharises , when the kingdome of God should come , hee answered them , and said , The kingdome of God commeth not with obseruation .
Neither shall they say , Loe here , or loe there : for behold , the kingdome of God is within you .
And hee said vnto the disciples , The dayes will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the dayes of the Sonne of man , and ye shall not see it .
And they shall say to you , See here , or see there : Goe not after them , nor follow them .
For as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen , shineth vnto the other part vnder heauen : so shall also the Sonne of man be in his day .
But first must hee suffer many things , & be reiected of this generation .
And as it was in the dayes of Noe : so shal it be also in the dayes of the Sonne of man .
They did eate , they dranke , they married wiues , they were giuen in mariage , vntill the day that Noe entred into the arke : and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
Likewise also as it was in the dayes of Lot , they did eat , they dranke , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded :
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodome , it rained fire and brimstone from heauen , & destroyed them all :
Euen thus shall it bee in the day when the Sonne of man is reuealed .
In that day he which shall be vpon the house top , and his stuffe in the house , let him not come downe to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not returne backe .
Remember Lots wife .
Whosoeuer shall seeke to saue his life , shall lose it , and whosoeuer shall lose his life , shall preserue it .
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shal be taken , the other shall be left . Two women shall bee grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .

And he spake a parable vnto them , to this ende , that men ought alwayes to pray , and not to faint ,
Saying , There was in a city a Iudge , which feared not God neither regarded man .
And there was a widowe in that citie , and she came vnto him , saying , Auenge me of mine aduersarie :
And hee would not for a while . But afterward he said within himselfe , Though I feare not God , nor regard man ,
Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will auenge her , lest by her continuall comming , she wearie me .
And the Lord said , Heare what the vniust iudge saith .
And shall not God auenge his owne elect , which crie day and night vnto him , thogh he beare long with them ?
I tell you that he wil auenge them speedily . Neuerthelesse , when the Son of man commeth , shall hee find faith on the earth ?
And he spake this parable vnto certaine which trusted in themselues that they were righteous , & despised other :
Two men went vp into the Temple to pray , the one a Pharisee , and the other a Publicane .
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himselfe , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , vniust , adulterers , or euen as this Publicane .
I fast twise in the weeke , I giue tithes of all that I possesse .
And the Publicane standing afarre off , would not lift vp so much as his eyes vnto heauen : but smote vpon his breast , saying , God me mercifull to mee a sinner .
I tell you , this man went downe to his house iustified rather then the other : For euery one that exalteth himselfe , shall be abased : and hee that humbleth himselfe , shall be exalted .
And they brought vnto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
But Iesus called them vnto him , and said , Suffer litle children to come vnto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdome of God .
Uerely I say vnto you , whosoeuer shall not receiue the kingdome of God as a litle child , shal in no wise enter therein .
And a certaine ruler asked him , saying , Good master , what shall I doe to inherit eternall life ?
And Iesus said vnto him , Why callest thou mee good ? None is good saue one , that is God .
Thou knowest the commaundements , Doe not commit adulterie , Doe not kill , Doe not steale , Doe not beare false witnesse , Honour thy father and thy mother .
And he said , All these haue I kept from my youth vp .
Now when Iesus heard these things , hee said vnto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : Sell all that thou hast , and distribute vnto the poore , and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen , and come , follow me .
And when he heard this , he was very sorowfull , for he was very rich .
And when Iesus saw that hee was very sorrowfull , he said , How hardly shal they that haue riches , enter into the kingdome of God ?
For it is easier for a camel to goe thorow a needles eye , then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
And they that heard it , said , Who then can be saued ?
And he said , The things which are vnpossible with men , are possible with God .
Then Peter said , Loe , we haue left all , and followed thee .
And he said vnto them , Uerily , I say vnto you , there is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdome of Gods sake ,
Who shall not receiue manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life euerlasting .
¶ Then hee tooke vnto him the twelue , and said vnto them , Behold , we goe vp to Hierusalem , and al things that are written by the Prophets concerning the sonne of man , shall be accomplished .
For he shall be deliuered vnto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully intreated , and spitted on :
And they shall scourge him , and put him to death , and the third day he shall rise againe .
And they vnderstood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
¶ And it came to passe , that as he was come nigh vnto Iericho , a certaine blinde man sate by the way side , begging ,
And hearing the multitude passe by , he asked what it meant .
And they tolde him that Iesus of Nazareth passeth by .
And he cried , saying , Iesus thou sonne of Dauid , haue mercie on me .
And they which went before , rebuked him , that hee should holde his peace : but hee cried so much the more , Thou Sonne of Dauid , haue mercie on mee .
And Iesus stood and commanded him to be brought vnto him : and when he was come neere , he asked him ,
Saying , What wilt thou that I shall doe vnto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receiue my sight .
And Iesus said vnto him , Receiue thy sight , thy faith hath saued thee .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iesus entred , and passed thorow Iericho .
And behold , there was a man named Zacheus , which was the cheefe among the Publicanes , and he was rich .
And he sought to see Iesus who he was , and could not for the prease , because he was litle of stature .
And he ranne before , and climed vp into a sycomore tree to see him , for he was to passe that way .
And when Iesus came to the place , he looked vp and saw him , and said vnto him , Zacheus , make haste , & come downe , for to day I must abide at thy house .
And he made haste , and came downe , and receiued him ioyfully .
And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
And Zacheus stood , and said vnto the Lord , Behold , Lord , the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore , & if I haue taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him foure fold .
And Iesus said vnto him , This day is saluation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is the sonne of Abraham .
For the sonne of man is come to seeke , and to saue that which was lost .
And as they heard these things , he added , and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Hierusalem , and because they thought that the kingdome of God should immediately appeare .
He said therefore , A certaine noble man went into a farre countrey , to receiue for himselfe a kingdome , and to returne .
And hee called his ten seruants , and deliuered them ten pounds , and said vnto them , Occupy till I come .
But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We wil not haue this man to reigne ouer vs .
And it came to passe , that when he was returned , hauing receiued the kingdome , then hee commaunded these seruants to be called vnto him , to whom he had giuen the money , that hee might know how much euery man had gained by trading .
Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
And he said vnto him , Well , thou good seruant : because thou hast bene faithfull in a very little , haue thou authoritie ouer ten cities .
And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained fiue pounds .
And hee said likewise to him , Bee thou also ouer fiue cities .
And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound which I haue kept layd vp in a napkin :
For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest vp that thou layedst not downe , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
And hee saith vnto him , Out of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee , thou wicked seruant : Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking vp that I layde not downe , and reaping that I did not sow .
Wherefore then gauest not thou my money into the bancke , that at my comming I might haue required mine owne with vsury ?
And he said vnto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and giue it to him that hath ten pounds .
And they said vnto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds .
For I say vnto you , That vnto euery one which hath , shalbe giuen , and from him that hath not , euen that hee hath shalbe taken away from him .
But those mine enemies which would not that I should reigne ouer them , bring hither , and slay them before mee .
¶ And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending vp to Hierusalem .
And it came to passe when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethanie , at the mount called the mount of Oliues , he sent two of his disciples ,
Saying , Goe ye into the village ouer against you , in the which at your entring ye shall find a Colt tied , whereon yet neuer man sate : loose him , and bring him hither .
And if any man aske you , Why do ye loose him ? Thus shall ye say vnto him , Because the Lord hath neede of him .
And they that were sent , went their way , and found euen as hee had said vnto them .
And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said vnto them , Why loose ye the Colt ?
And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
And they brought him to Iesus : and they cast their garments vpon the Colt , and they set Iesus thereon .
And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
And when he was come nigh euen now at the descent of the mount of Oliues , the whole multitude of the disciples began to reioyce and praise God with a loud voice , for all the mighty workes that they had seene ,
Saying , Blessed bee the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord , peace in heauen , and glory in the Highest .
And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude saide vnto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
And he answered , and said vnto them , I tell you , that if these should holde their peace , the stones would immediatly cry out .
¶ And when he was come neere , he beheld the city and wept ouer it ,
Saying , If thou hadst knowen , euen thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong vnto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
For the dayes shall come vpon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compasse thee round , and keepe thee in on euery side ,
And shall lay thee euen with the ground , and thy children within thee : and they shall not leaue in thee one stone vpon another , because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
And he went into the Temple , and began to cast out them that solde therein , and them that bought ,
Saying vnto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye haue made it a denne of theeues .
And he taught daily in the Temple . But the chiefe Priestes and the Scribes , and the chiefe of the people sought to destroy him ,
<NON-VERSE>
And it came to passe , that on one of those dayes , as he taught the people in the Temple , and preached the Gospel , the chiefe Priests and the Scribes came vpon him , with the Elders ,
And spake vnto him , saying , Tell vs , by what authoritie doest thou these things ? or who is hee that gaue thee this authoritie ?
And hee answered , and said vnto them , I will also aske you one thing , and answere me .
The Baptisme of Iohn , was it from heauen , or of men ?
And they reasoned with themselues , saying , If wee shall say , From heauen , he will say , Why then beleeued yee him not ?
But and if we say , Of men , all the people will stone vs : for they be perswaded that Iohn was a Prophet .
And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
And Iesus said vnto them , Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things .
Then began hee to speake to the people this parable : A certaine man planted a vineyard , and let it foorth to husbandmen , and went into a farre countrey for a long time .
And againe he sent the third , and they wounded him also , & cast him out .
Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I doe ? I will send my beloued sonne : it may be they will reuerence him when they see him .
But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselues , saying , This is the heire , come , let vs kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard doe vnto them ?
Hee shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall giue the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
And hee beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders reiected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone , shalbe broken : but on whomsoeuer it shall fall , it will grinde him to powder .
¶ And the chiefe Priests and the Scribes the same houre sought to lay hands on him , and they feared the people : for they perceiued that he had spoken this parable against them .
And they watched him , and sent foorth spies , which should faine themselues iust men , that they might take holde of his words , that so they might deliuer him vnto the power and authoritie of the gouernour .
And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truely .
Is it lawfull for vs to giue tribute vnto Cesar , or no ?
But he perceiued their craftines , and said vnto them , Why tempt ye me ?
Shew me a peny : whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered , and said , Cesars .
And he said vnto them , Render therefore vnto Cesar the things which be Cesars , and vnto God the things which be Gods .
And they could not take holde of his wordes before the people , and they marueiled at his answere , and helde their peace .
¶ Then came to him certaine of the Sadduces ( which denie that there is any resurrection ) and they asked him ,
Saying , Master , Moses wrote vnto vs , If any mans brother die , hauing a wife , and hee die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise vp seede vnto his brother . There were therefore seuen brethren , and the first tooke a wife , and died without children .
Last of all the woman died also .
Therefore in the resurrection , whose wife of them is she ? for seuen had her to wife .
And Iesus answering , said vnto them , The children of this world , marrie , and are giuen in marriage :
But they which shall be accompted worthy to obtaine that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marrie , nor are giuen in marriage .
Neither can they die any more ; for they are equall vnto the Angels , and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
Now that the dead are raised , euen Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isahac , and the God of Iacob .
For he is not a God of the dead , but of the liuing for all liue vnto him .
¶ Then certaine of the Scribes answering , said , Master , Thou hast well said .
And after that , they durst not aske him any question at all .
And he said vnto them , How say they that Christ is Dauids sonne ?
And Dauid himselfe saith in the booke of Psalmes , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
Till I make thine enemies thy footestoole .
Dauid therefore calleth him , Lord , how is he then his sonne ?
¶ Then in the audience of all the people , he said vnto his disciples ,
Beware of the Scribes , which desire to walke in long robes , and loue greetings in the markets , and the highest seates in the Synagogues , and the chiefe roumes at feasts :
<NON-VERSE>
And he looked vp , and saw the rich men casting their giftes into the treasurie .
And hee saw also a certaine poore widow , casting in thither two mites .
And he said , Of a truth , I say vnto you , that this poore widow hath cast in more then they all .
For all these haue of their abundance cast in vnto the offerings of God , but shee of her penurie hath cast in all the liuing that she had .
¶ And as some spake of the Temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones , and gifts , he said ,
As for these things which yee behold , the dayes will come , in the which there shal not be left one stone vpon another , that shal not be throwen downe .
And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what signe wil there be , when these things shall come to passe ?
And he said , Take heede that yee be not deceiued : for many shall come in my Name , saying , I am Christ , and the time draweth neere : goe yee not therefore after them .
But when ye shall heare of wars , and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to passe , but the end is not by and by .
Then said he vnto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdome against kingdome :
And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places , and famines , and pestilences : and fearefull sights and great signes shall there be from heauen .
But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , deliuering you vp to the Synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before Kings and rulers for my Names sake . And it shall turne to you for a testimony .
Settle it therfore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answere .
For I will giue you a mouth and wisedome , which all your aduersaries shall not be able to gainsay , nor resist .
And yee shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren , and kinsefolkes and friends , and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
And ye shalbe hated of all men for my Names sake .
But there shall not a haire of your head perish .
In your patience possesse ye your soules .
And when yee shall see Hierusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
Then let them which are in Iudea , flee to the mountaines , and let them which are in the midst of it , depart out , and let not them that are in the countreys , enter thereinto .
For these be the dayes of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
But woe vnto them that are with childe , and to them that giue sucke in those dayes , for there shalbe great distresse in the land , and wrath vpon this people .
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall bee led away captiue into all nations , and Hierusalem shall be troden downe of the Gentiles , vntill the times of the Gentiles bee fulfilled .
¶ And there shalbe signes in the Sunne , and in the Moone , and in the Starres , and vpon the earth distresse of nations , with perplexity , the Sea and the waues roaring ,
Mens hearts failing them for feare , and for looking after those things which are comming on the earth ; For the powers of heauen shall be shaken .
And then shall they see the sonne of man comming in a cloud with power and great glory .
And when these things begin to come to passe , then looke vp , and lift vp your heads , for your redemptiou draweth nigh .
And he spake to them a parable , Behold the figge tree , and all the trees ,
When they now shoot foorth , yee see and know of your owne selues , that summer is now nigh at hand .
So likewise yee , when yee see these things come to passe , know ye that the kingdome of God is nigh at hand .
Uerily I say vnto you , this generation shall not passe away , till all be fulfilled .
Heauen and earth shall passe away , but my words shall not passe away .
¶ And take heed to your selues , least at any time your hearts be ouercharged with surfetting , and drunkennesse , and cares of this life , and so that day come vpon you vnawares .
For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
Watch ye therefore , and pray alwayes , that ye may be accompted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to passe , and to stand before the sonne of man .
And in the day time he was teaching in the Temple , and at night hee went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Oliues .
<NON-VERSE>
Now the feast of vnleuened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passeouer .
And the chiefe Priests and Scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
¶ Then entred Satan into Iudas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelue .
And he went his way , and communed with the chiefe Priests and captaines , how he might betray him vnto them .
And they were glad , and couenanted to giue him money .
And he promised , and sought opportunitie to betray him vnto them in the absence of the multitude .
¶ Then came the day of vnleauened bread , when the Passeouer must be killed .
And he sent Peter and Iohn , saying , Goe and prepare vs the Passeouer , that we may eate .
And they said vnto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
And he said vnto them , Behold , when ye are entred into the citie , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water , follow him into the house where he entreth in .
And yee shall say vnto the goodman of the house , The Master saith vnto thee , Where is the ghest - chamber where I shall eate the Passeouer with my disciples ?
And he shall shew you a large vpper roume furnished , there make ready .
And they went , and found as hee had said vnto them , and they made readie the Passeouer .
And when the houre was come , he sate downe , and the twelue Apostles with him .
And he said vnto them , With desire I haue desired to eate this Passeouer with you before I suffer .
For I say vnto you , I will not any more eate thereof , vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God .
And hee tooke the cup , and gaue thanks , and said , Take this , and diuide it among your selues .
For I say vnto you , I will not drinke of the fruit of the Uine , vntill the kingdome of God shall come .
¶ And hee tooke bread , and gaue thankes , and brake it , and gaue vnto them , saying , This is my body which is giuen for you , this doe in remembrance of me .
Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the New Testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
¶ But beholde , the hand of him that betrayeth mee , is with mee on the table .
And truly the Sonne of man goeth as it was determined , but woe vnto that man by whom he is betraied .
And they began to enquire among themselues , which of them it was that should doe this thing .
¶ And there was also a strife among them , which of them should bee accompted the greatest .
And hee saide vnto them , The Kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship ouer them , & they that exercise authoritie vpon them , are called benefactors .
But ye shall not be so ; but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the yonger , and he that is chiefe , as he that doeth serue .
For whether is greater , hee that sitteth at meat , or hee that serueth ? Is not he that sitteth at meat ? But I am among you as he that serueth .
Ye are they which haue continued with me in my temptations .
And I appoint vnto you a kingdome , as my Father hath appointed vnto me ,
That yee may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome , and sit on thrones iudging the twelue Tribes of Israel .
¶ And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , beholde , Satan hath desired to haue you , that he may sift you as wheat :
But I haue prayed for thee , that thy faith faile not ; and when thou art conuerted , strengthen thy brethren .
And hee said vnto him , Lord , I am ready to goe with thee both into prison , and to death .
And hee said , I tell thee Peter , the cocke shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrise denie that thou knowest me .
And he said vnto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shooes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing .
Then saide hee vnto them , But now he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and hee that hath no sword , let him sel his garment , and buy one .
For I say vnto you , that this that is written , must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : For the things concerning me haue an end .
And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And hee saide vnto them , It is ynough .
¶ And he came out , and went , as hee was wont , to the mount of Oliues , and his disciples also followed him .
And when he was at the place , he said vnto them , Pray , that yee enter not into temptation .
And he was withdrawen from them about a stones cast , and kneeled downe , and prayed ,
Saying , Father , if thou be willing , remooue this cup from me : neuerthelesse , not my will , but thine be done .
And there appeared an Angel vnto him from heauen , strengthening him .
And being in an agonie , he prayed more earnestly , and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling downe to the ground .
And when he rose vp from prayer , and was come to his disciples , hee found them sleeping for sorrow ,
And said vnto them , Why sleepe yee ? Rise , and pray , lest yee enter into temptation .
¶ And while he yet spake , behold , a multitude , and hee that was called Iudas , one of the twelue , went before them , and drewe neere vnto Iesus , to kisse him .
But Iesus said vnto him , Iudas , betrayest thou the sonne of man with a kisse ?
When they which were about him , saw what would follow , they said vnto him , Lord , shall wee smite with the sword ?
¶ And one of them smote the seruant of the high Priest , and cut off his right eare .
And Iesus answered , and said , Suffer ye thus farre . And he touched his eare , and healed him .
Then Iesus said vnto the chiefe Priests , and captaines of the Temple , and the Elders which were come to him , Be ye come out as against a thiefe , with swords and staues ?
When I was daily with you in the Temple , yee stretched foorth no hands against mee : but this is your houre , and the power of darkenesse .
¶ Then tooke they him , and led him , and brought him into the high Priests house , and Peter followed afarre off .
And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall , and were set downe together , Peter sate downe among them .
But a certaine maide beheld him as he sate by the fire , and earnestly looked vpon him , and said , This man was also with him .
And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not .
And after a little while another saw him , & said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not .
And about the space of one houre after , another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a trueth this fellow also was with him ; for he is a Galilean .
And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately while he yet spake , the cocke crew .
And the Lord turned , and looked vpon Peter ; and Peter remembred the word of the Lord , how he had said vnto him , Before the cocke crow , thou shalt deny me thrise .
And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
¶ And the men that helde Iesus , mocked him , and smote him .
And when they had blindfolded him , they stroke him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesie , who is it that smote thee ?
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
¶ And assoone as it was day , the Elders of the people , & the chiefe Priests and the Scribes came together , and led him into their Councell , saying ,
Art thou the Christ ? Tell vs . And hee said vnto them , If I tell you , you will not beleeue .
And if I also aske you , you will not answere me , nor let me goe .
Hereafter shal the sonne of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
Then said they all , Art thou then the Sonne of God ? And hee said vnto them , Ye say that I am .
<NON-VERSE>
And the whole multitude of them arose , and led him vnto Pilate .
And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow peruerting the nation , and forbidding to giue tribute to Cesar , saying , that he himselfe is Christ a king .
And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the king of the Iewes ? And he answered him , & said , Thou sayest it .
Then saide Pilate to the chiefe Priests , and to the people , I finde no fault in this man .
And they were the more fierce , saying , He stirreth vp the people , teaching thorowout all Iurie , beginning from Galilee to this place .
When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilean .
And assoone as he knew that hee belonged vnto Herods iurisdiction , hee sent him to Herode , who himselfe also was at Hierusalem at that time .
¶ And when Herode saw Iesus , he was exceeding glad , for hee was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him , and hee hoped to haue seene some miracle done by him .
Then he questioned with him in many words , but he answered him nothing .
And the chiefe Priests and Scribes stood , and vehemently accused him .
And Herod with his men of warre set him at naught , and mocked him , and arayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him againe to Pilate .
¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together ; for before , they were at enmitie betweene themselues .
¶ And Pilate , when hee had called together the chiefe Priests , and the rulers , and the people ,
Said vnto them , Ye haue brought this man vnto me , as one that peruerteth the people , and behold , I hauing examined him before you , haue found no fault in this man , touching those things whereof ye accuse him .
No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him , and loe , nothing worthy of death is done vnto him . I will therefore chastise him , and release him .
For of necessitie hee must release one vnto them at the Feast .
And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release vnto vs Barabbas ,
Who for a certaine sedition made in the citie , and for murder , was cast in prison .
Pilate therefore willing to release Iesus , spake againe to them :
But they cried , saying , Crucifie him , crucifie him .
And hee said vnto them the third time , Why , what euill hath he done ? I haue found no cause of death in him , I will therefore chastise him , & let him goe .
And they were instant with loud voyces , requiring that he might be crucified : and the voyces of them , and of the chiefe Priests preuailed .
And Pilate gaue sentence that it should be as they required .
And he released vnto them , him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired , but he deliuered Iesus to their will .
And as they led him away , they laid hold vpon one Simon a Cyrenian , comming out of the countrey , and on him they laid the crosse , that hee might beare it after Iesus .
¶ And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed & lamented him .
But Iesus turning vnto them , said , Daughters of Hierusalem , weepe not for me , but weepe for your selues , and for your children .
For beholde , the dayes are comming , in the which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that neuer bare , and the paps which neuer gaue sucke .
Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines , Fall on vs , and to the hils , Couer vs .
For if they doe these things in a green tree , what shalbe done in the drie ?
And there were also two other malefactors led with him , to bee put to death .
And when they were come to the place which is called Caluarie , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
¶ Then said Iesus , Father , forgiue them , for they know not what they doe : And they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
And the people stood beholding , & the rulers also with them derided him , saying , Hee saued others , let him saue himselfe , if he be Christ , the chosen of God .
And the souldiers also mocked him , comming to him , and offering him vineger ,
And saying , If thou be the king of the Iewes , saue thy selfe .
And a superscription also was written ouer him in letters of Greeke , and Latin , & Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE IEWES .
¶ And one of the malefactors , which were hanged , railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , saue thy selfe and vs .
But the other answering , rebuked him , saying , Doest not thou feare God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
And we indeed iustly ; for we receiue the due reward of our deeds , but this man hath done nothing amisse .
And he said vnto Iesus , Lord , remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome .
And Iesus said vnto him , Uerily , I say vnto thee , to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise . And it was about the sixt houre , and there was a darkenesse ouer all the earth , vntill the ninth houre .
And the Sunne was darkened , and the vaile of the temple was rent in the mids .
¶ And when Iesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : And hauing said thus , he gaue vp the ghost .
Now when the Centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood a farre off , beholding these things . ¶ And behold , there was a man named Ioseph , a counseller , and hee was a good man , and a iust .
( The same had not consented to the counsell and deede of them ) he was of Arimathea , a city of the Iewes ( who also himselfe waited for the kingdome of God . )
This man went vnto Pilate , and begged the body of Iesus .
And he tooke it downe , and wrapped it in linnen , and layd it in a Sepulchre that was hewen in stone , wherein neuer man before was layd .
And that day was the Preparation , and the Sabbath drew on .
And the women also which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the Sepulchre , and how his body was layd .
<NON-VERSE>
Now vpon the first day of the weeke , very earely in the morning , they came vnto the Sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certaine others with them .
And they found the stone rolled away from the Sepulchre .
And they entred in , and found not the body of the Lord Iesus .
And it came to passe , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments .
And as they were afraid , and bowed downe their faces to the earth , they said vnto them , Why seek ye the liuing among the dead ?
He is not heere , but is risen : Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
Saying , The Sonne of man must be deliuered into the hands of sinfull men , and be crucified , and the third day rise againe .
And they remembred his words ,
And returned from the Sepulchre , and told all these things vnto the eleuen , and to all the rest .
It was Marie Magdalene , & Ioanna , & Mary the mother of Iames , and other women that were with them , which tolde these things vnto the Apostles .
And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they beleeued them not .
Then arose Peter , and ranne vnto the Sepulchre , and stowping downe , hee behelde the linnen clothes layd by themselues , and departed , wondering in himselfe at that which was come to passe .
¶ And behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emaus , which was from Hierusalem about threescore furlongs .
And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
And it came to passe , that while they communed together , and reasoned , Iesus himselfe drew neere , and went with them .
But their eyes were holden , that they should not know him .
And he said vnto them , What maner of communications are these that yee haue one to another as yee walke , and are sad ?
And the one of them , whose name was Cleophas , answering , saide vnto him , Art thou onely a stranger in Hierusalem , and hast not knowen the things which are come to passe there in these dayes ?
And hee saide vnto them , What things ? And they said vnto him , Concerning Iesus of Nazareth , which was a Prophet , mighty in deede and word before God , and all the people .
And how the chiefe Priests and our rulers deliuered him to be condemned to death , and haue crucified him .
But wee trusted that it had bene hee , which should haue redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
Yea , and certaine women also of our company made vs astonished , which were early at the Sepulchre :
And when they found not his bodie , they came , saying , that they had also seene a vision of Angels , which saide that he was aliue .
And certaine of them which were with vs , went to the Sepulchre , and found it euen so as the women had said , but him they saw not .
Then hee saide vnto them , O fooles , and slow of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue spoken :
Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things , and to enter into his glorie ?
And beginning at Moses , and all the Prophets , hee expounded vnto them in all the Scriptures , the things concerning himselfe .
And they drew nigh vnto the village , whither they went , and hee made as though hee would haue gone further .
But they constrained him , saying , Abide with vs , for it is towards euening , and the day is farre spent : And he went in , to tarrie with them .
And it came to passe , as hee sate at meate with them , hee tooke bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gaue to them .
And their eyes were opened , and they knew him , and he vanished out of their sight .
And they said one vnto another , Did not our heart burne within vs , while hee talked with vs by the way , and while hee opened to vs the Scriptures ?
And they rose vp the same houre , and returned to Hierusalem , and found the eleuen gathered together , and them that were with them ,
Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
And they told what things were done in the way , & how he was knowen of them in breaking of bread .
¶ And as they thus spake , Iesus himselfe stood in the midst of them , and sayeth vnto them , Peace bee vnto you .
But they were terrified , and afrighted , and supposed that they had seene a spirit .
And he said vnto them , Why are yee troubled , and why doe thoughts arise in your hearts ?
Beholde my hands and my feete , that it is I my selfe : handle me , and see , for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me haue .
And when hee had thus spoken , hee shewed them his handes and his feete .
And while they yet beleeued not for ioy , and wondered , hee saide vnto them , Haue ye here any meat ?
And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish , and of an hony combe .
And he tooke it , and did eate before them .
And hee said vnto them , These are the words which I spake vnto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the Law of Moses , & in the Prophets , and in the Psalmes concerning me .
Then opened he their vnderstanding , that they might vnderstand the Scriptures ,
And said vnto them , Thus it is written , & thus it behoued Christ to suffer , & to rise from the dead the third day : And that repentance and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name , among all nations , beginning at Hierusalem .
And yee are witnesses of these things .
¶ And behold , I send the promise of my Father vpon you : but tarie ye in the citie of Hierusalem , vntill ye be indued with power from on high .
¶ And he led them out as farre as to Bethanie , and hee lift vp his hands , and blessed them .
And it came to passe , while hee blessed them , hee was parted from them , and caried vp into heauen .
And they worshipped him , and returned to Hierusalem , with great ioy :

The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi .
I haue loued you , sayth the Lord : yet yee say , Wherein hast thou loued vs ? was not Esau Iacobs brother , sayth the Lord ? yet I loued Iacob ,
And I hated Esau , and layde his mountaines , and his heritage waste , for the dragons of the wildernesse .
Whereas Edom sayth , Wee are impouerished , but we will returne and build the desolate places ; Thus sayth the Lord of hostes , They shal build , but I will throw downe ; and they shal call them , The border of wickednesse , & the people against whom the Lord hath indignation for euer .
And your eyes shall see , and yee shall say ; The Lord will be magnified from the border of Israel .
¶ A sonne honoureth his father , and a seruant his Master . If then I be a father , where is mine honour ? and if I be a Master , where is my feare , saith the Lord of hostes , vnto you O priests , that despise my name ? and yee say , Wherein haue we despised thy name ?
Yee offer polluted bread vpon mine altar ; and yee say , Wherein haue we polluted thee ? In that yee say , The table of the Lord is contemptible .
And if hee offer the blind for sacrifice , is it not euill ? and if yee offer the lame and sicke , is it not euill ? offer it now vnto thy gouernour : will he be pleased with thee , or accept thy person , saith the Lord of hostes ?
And now I pray you , beseech God , that hee will be gracious vnto vs : this hath beene by your meanes : will he regard your persons , saith the Lord of hostes ?
Who is there euen among you that would shut the doores for nought ? neither doe yee kindle fire on mine altar for nought . I haue no pleasure in you , saith the Lord of hostes , neither will I accept an offring at your hand .
For from the rising of the Sunne , euen vnto the going downe of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles , and in euery place incense shall be offered vnto my name , and a pure offring : for my name shall be great among the heathen , saith the Lord of hostes .
¶ But yee haue prophaned it , in that yee say ; The table of the Lord is polluted , and the fruite thereof , euen his meate , is contemptible .
Yee said also ; Behold what a wearinesse is it , and yee haue snuffed at it , saith the Lord of hostes , and yee brought that which was torne , and the lame , and the sicke : thus yee brought an offring : should I accept this of your hand , saith the Lord ?

And now , O yee Priests , this commaundement is for you .
If ye will not heare , and if yee will not lay it to heart , to giue glory vnto my name , saith the Lord of hostes ; I will euen send a curse vpon you , and will curse your blessings : yea , I haue cursed them already , because yee doe not lay it to heart .
Behold , I will corrupt your seed , and spread doung vpon your faces , euen the doung of your solemne feasts , and one shall take you away with it .
And yee shall know that I haue sent this commaundement vnto you , that my couenant might be with Leui , saith the Lord of hostes .
My couenant was with him of life and peace , and I gaue them to him , for the feare , wherewith he feared mee , and was afraid before my name .
The law of truth was in his mouth , and iniquitie was not found in his lips : he walked with me in peace and equitie , and did turne many away from iniquitie .
For the priests lips should keepe knowledge , and they should seeke the law at his mouth : for he is the messenger of the Lord of hostes .
But yee are departed out of the way : ye haue caused many to stumble at the law : ye haue corrupted the couenant of Leui , saith the Lord of hostes .
Therefore haue I also made you contemptible and base before al the people , according as yee haue not kept my wayes , but haue bin partiall in the law .
Haue we not all one father ? hath not one God created vs ? Why doe we deale treacherously euery man against his brother , by prophaning the couenant of our fathers ?
And this haue yee done againe , couering the Altar of the Lord with teares , with weeping and with crying out , in so much that hee regardeth not the offering any more , or receiueth it with good will at your hand .
¶ Yet ye say , Wherefore ? Because the Lord hath bene witnes betweene thee and the wife of thy youth , against whome thou hast dealt treacherously : yet is she thy companion , and the wife of thy couenant .
And did not he make one ? yet had he the residue of the spirit : and wherefore one ? that hee might seeke a godly seed : therefore take heed to your spirit , and let none deale treacherously against the wife of his youth .
For the Lord the God of Israel saith , that he hateth putting away : for one couereth violence with his garment , saith the Lord of hosts , therfore take heed to your spirit , that ye deale not treacherously .

Beholde , I will send my messenger , and he shal prepare the way before mee : and the Lord whom ye seeke , shall suddenly come to his Temple : euen the messenger of the Couenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the Lord of hosts .
But who may abide the day of his comming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like a refiners fire , and like fullers sope .
And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of siluer : and he shall purifie the sonnes of Leui , and purge them as gold & siluer , that they may offer vnto the Lord an offring in righteousnes .
Then shall the offerings of Iudah and Ierusalem bee pleasant vnto the Lord , as in the dayes of old , and as in former yeeres .
And I will come neere to you to iudgement , and I will bee a swift witnesse against the sorcerers , and against the adulterers , and against false swearers , and against those that oppresse the hireling in his wages , the widowe , and the fatherlesse , and that turne aside the stranger from his right , and feare not me , saith the Lord of hosts .
For I am the Lord , I change not : therefore ye sonnes of Iacob are not consumed .
¶ Euen from the dayes of your fathers yee are gone away from mine ordinances , and haue not kept them : returne vnto me , and I will returne vnto you , saith the Lord of hosts : But ye said , Wherein shall we returne ?
¶ Wil a man rob God ? yet ye haue robbed me . But ye say , Wherein haue we robbed thee ? In tithes & offerings .
Ye are cursed with a curse : for ye haue robbed me , euen this whole nation .
Bring ye all the tithes into the store - house , that there may be meate in mine house , & proue me now herewith , saith the Lord of hostes , if I will not open you the windowes of heauen , and powre you out a blessing , that there shall not be roome enough to receiue it .
And I wil rebuke the deuourer for your sakes : and he shal not destroy the fruits of your ground , neither shal your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field , saith the Lord of hosts .
And all nations shall call you blessed : for ye shall be a delightsome land , saith the Lord of hosts .
¶ Your words haue bin stout against me , saith the Lord , yet ye say , What haue we spoken so much against thee ?
Ye haue said , It is vaine to serue God : and what profit is it , that we haue kept his ordinance , and that wee haue walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts ?
And now we call the proud happy : yea , they that worke wickednes are set vp , yea they that tempt God , are euen deliuered .
¶ Then they that feared the Lord , spake often one to another , and the Lord hearkened and heard it , & a booke of remembrance was written before him , for them that feared the Lord , & that thought vpon his name .
And they shall be mine , saith the Lord of hosts , in that day when I make vp my iewels , and I wil spare them as a man spareth his owne sonne that serueth him .

For beholde , the day commeth , that shall burne as an ouen , and all the proud , yea and all that doe wickedly shalbe stubble : and the day that commeth , shal burne them vp , saith the Lord of hostes , that it shall leaue them neither roote nor branch .
¶ But vnto you that feare my Name , shall the Sunne of righteousnesse arise with healing in his wings , and shall goe foorth and grow vp as calues of the staule .
And yee shall treade downe the wicked : for they shall bee ashes vnder the soles of your feet , in the day that I shall doe this , saith the Lord of hosts .
¶ Remember yee the Law of Moses my seruant , which I commanded vnto him in Horeb for all Israel , with the Statutes and iudgements .

Iohn did baptize in the wildernesse , and preach the baptisme of repentance , for the remission of sinnes .
And there went out vnto him all the land of Iudea , and they of Ierusalem , and were all baptized of him in the riuer of Iordane , confessing their sinnes .
And Iohn was clothed with camels haire , and with a girdle of a skin about his loines : and he did eat locusts and wilde honie ,
And preached , saying , There commeth one mightier then I after me , the latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to stoupe downe , and vnloose .
I indeed haue baptized you with water : but hee shall baptize you with the holy Ghost .
And it came to passe in those daies , that Iesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of Iohn in Iordane .
And straightway comming vp out of the water , hee saw the heauens opened , and the Spirit like a doue descending vpon him .
And there came a voice from heauen , saying , Thou art my beloued Sonne , in whom I am well pleased .
And immediately the Spirit driueth him into the wildernesse .
And he was there in the wildernesse fourtie daies tempted of Satan , and was with the wildbeasts , and the Angels ministred vnto him .
Now after that Iohn was put in prison , Iesus came into Galilee , preaching the Gospell of the kingdome of God ,
And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdome of God is at hand : repent ye , and beleeue the Gospell .
Now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the Sea ( for they were fishers . )
And Iesus said vnto them , Come ye after me ; and I will make you to become fishers of men .
And straightway they forsooke their nets , and followed him .
And when hee had gone a little further thence , hee saw Iames the sonne of Zebedee , and Iohn his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired seruants , and went after him .
And they went into Capernaum , and straightway on the Sabbath day he entred into the Synagogue , and taught .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for hee taught them as one that had authority , and not as the Scribes .
And there was in their Synagogue a man with an vncleane spirit , and he cried out ,
Saying , Let vs alone , what haue we to doe with thee , thou Iesus of Nazareth ? Art thou come to destroy vs ? I know thee who thou art , the holy One of God .
And Iesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
And when the vncleane spirit had torne him , and cried with a lowd voice , he came out of him .
And they were all amased , insomuch that they questioned among themselues , saying , What thing is this ? What new doctrine is this ? For with authoritie commandeth he euen the vncleane spirits , and they doe obey him .
And immediatly his fame spread abroad throughout al the region round about Galilee .
And forth with , when they were come out of the Synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon , and Andrew , with Iames and Iohn .
But Simons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer : and anone they tell him of her .
And he came and tooke her by the hand , and lift her vp , and immediately the feuer left her , and she ministred vnto them .
And at euen , when the Sunne did set , they brought vnto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with diuels :
And all the citie was gathered together at the doore .
And he healed many that were sicke of diuers diseases , and cast out many deuils , and suffered not the deuils to speake , because they knew him .
And in the morning , rising vp a great while before day , hee went out , and departed into a solitarie place , and there prayed .
And Simon , and they that were with him , followed after him :
And when they had found him , they said vnto him , All men seek for thee .
And he said vnto them , Let vs goe into the next townes , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I foorth .
And he preached in their Synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out deuils .
And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling downe to him , and saying vnto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me cleane .
And he straitly charged him , and forth with sent him away ,
And saith vnto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but goe thy way , shew thy selfe to the Priest , and offer for thy clensing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony vnto them .
<NON-VERSE>
And againe hee entred into Capernaum after some dayes , and it was noysed that he was in the house .
And straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no roome to receiue them , no not so much as about the doore : and he preached the word vnto them .
And they come vnto him , bringing one sicke of the palsie , which was borne of foure .
And when they could not come nigh vnto him for preasse , they vncouered the roofe where he was : and when they had broken it vp , they let downe the bed wherin the sick of the palsie lay .
When Iesus saw their faith , hee said vnto the sicke of the palsie , Sonne , thy sinnes be forgiuen thee .
But there were certaine of the Scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
Why doeth this man thus speake blasphemies ? Who can forgiue sinnes but God onely ?
And immediatly , when Iesus perceiued in his Spirit , that they so reasoned within themselues , he said vnto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie , Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee : or to say , Arise , and take vp thy bed and walke ?
But that yee may know that the Sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue sinnes , ( Hee saith to the sicke of the palsie , )
I say vnto thee , Arise , & take vp thy bed , & goe thy way into thine house .
And immediatly he arose , tooke vp the bed , and went foorth before them all , insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , Wee neuer saw it on this fashion .
And he went foorth againe by the sea side , and all the multitude resorted vnto him , and he taught them .
And as he passed by , he saw Leui the son of Alpheus sitting at the receit of Custome , and said vnto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him .
And it came to passe , that as Iesus sate at meate in his house , many Publicanes and sinners sate also together with Iesus and his disciples : for there were many , & they followed him .
And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him eate with Publicanes and sinners , they said vnto his disciples , How is it that hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes and sinners ?
When Iesus heard it , he saith vnto them , They that are whole , haue no need of the Physition , but they that are sicke : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
And the disciples of Iohn , and of the Pharisees vsed to fast ; and they come , and say vnto him , Why doe the disciples of Iohn , and of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
And Iesus said vnto them , Can the children of the bride - chamber fast , while the Bridegrome is with them ? As long as they haue the Bridegrome with them , they cannot fast .
But the dayes will come , when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those dayes .
No man also soweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it vp , taketh away from the old , & the rent is made worse .
And no man putteth new wine into old bottles , else the new wine doeth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will bee marred : But new wine must bee put into new bottles .
And it came to passe , that he went thorow the corne fields on the Sabbath day , & his disciples began as they went , to plucke the eares of corne .
And the Pharisees saide vnto him , Behold , why do they on the Sabbath day that which is not lawfull ?
And he said vnto them , Haue ye neuer read what Dauid did , when hee had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
How hee went into the house of God in the dayes of Abiathar the high Priest , and did eate the Shew - bread , which is not lawfull to eate , but for the Priests , and gaue also to them which were with him ?
And hee said vnto them , The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath :
<NON-VERSE>
And he entred againe into the Synagogue , and there was a man there which had a withered hand :
And they watched him , whether hee would heale him on the Sabbath day , that they might accuse him .
And he saith vnto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
And hee saith vnto them , Is it lawfull to doe good on the Sabbath dayes , or to doe euill ? to saue life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieued for the hardnesse of their hearts , He saith vnto the man , Stretch foorth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway tooke counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
But Iesus withdrew himselfe with his disciples to the Sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Iudea ,
And from Hierusalem , and from Idumea , and from beyond Iordane , and they about Tyre & Sydon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came vnto him .
And he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him , because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
For he had healed many , insomuch that they preassed vpon him , for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
And vncleane spirits , when they saw him , fell downe before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Sonne of God .
And he straitly charged them , that they should not make him knowen .
And he goeth vp into a mountaine , and calleth vnto him whom he would : and they came vnto him .
And he ordeined twelue , that they should be with him , and that hee might send them foorth to preach :
And to haue power to heale sickenesses , and to cast out deuils .
And Simon he surnamed Peter .
And Iames the sonne of Zebedee , and Iohn the brother of Iames ( and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sonnes of thunder . )
And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and Iames the sonne of Alpheus , and Thaddeus , and Simon the Canaanite , And Iudas Iscariot , which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
And the multitude commeth together againe , so that they could not so much as eate bread .
And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him , for they said , He is beside himselfe .
¶ And the Scribes which came downe from Hierusalem , said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the deuils , casteth he out deuils .
And he called them vnto him , and said vnto them in parables , Howe can Satan cast out Satan ? And if a kingdome be diuided against it selfe , that kingdome cannot stand .
And if a house be diuided against it selfe , that house cannot stand .
And if Satan rise vp against himselfe , and be diuided , hee cannot stand , but hath an end .
No man can enter into a strong mans house , and spoile his goods , except he will first bind the strong man , and then he will spoile his house .
Uerely I say vnto you , All sinnes shalbe forgiuen vnto the sonnes of men , and blasphemies , wherewith soeuer they shall blaspheme :
But he that shal blaspheme against the holy Ghost , hath neuer forgiuenesse , but is in danger of eternall damnation .
Because they said , He hath an vncleane spirit .
¶ There came then his brethren , and his mother , and standing without , sent vnto him , calling him .
And the multitude sate about him and they said vnto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seeke for thee .
And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ?
And he looked round about on them which sate about him , and saide , Behold my mother and my brethren .

And he beganne againe to teach by the Sea side : and there was gathered vnto him a great multitude , so that he entred into a ship , and sate in the Sea : and the whole multitude was by the Sea on the land .
And he taught them many things by parables , and said vnto them in his doctrine ,
Hearken , Behold , there went out a sower to sow :
And it came to passe as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the foules of the aire came , & deuoured it vp .
And some fell on stonie ground , where it had not much earth : and immediately it sprang vp , because it had no depth of earth .
But when the Sunne was vp , it was scorched , and because it had no roote , it withered away .
And some fell among thornes , and the thornes grew vp , and choked it , and it yeelded no fruite .
And other fell on good ground , and did yeeld fruite that sprang vp , and increased , and brought foorth some thirtie , & some sixtie , & some an hundred .
And he said vnto them , He that hath eares to heare , let him heare .
And when hee was alone , they that were about him , with the twelue , asked of him the parable .
And he said vnto them , Unto you it is giuen to know the mystery of the kingdome of God : but vnto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
That seeing they may see , and not perceiue , and hearing they may heare , and not vnderstand , lest at any time they should be conuerted , and their sinnes should be forgiuen them .
And he said vnto them , Know ye not this parable ? And how then will you know all parables ?
¶ The Sower soweth the word .
And these are they by the way side , where the word is sowen , but when they haue heard , Satan commeth immediately , and taketh away the word that was sowen in their hearts .
And these are they likewise which are sowen on stonie ground , who when they haue heard the word , immediately receiue it with gladnesse :
And haue no roote in themselues , and so endure but for a time : afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake , immediately they are offended .
And these are they which are sowen among thorns : such as heare the word ,
And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulnesse of riches , and the lusts of other things entring in , choke the word , and it becommeth vnfruitfull .
And these are they which are sowen on good ground , such as heare the word , and receiue it , & bring foorth fruit , some thirty fold , some sixtie , and some an hundred .
¶ And he said vnto them , Is a candle brought to be put vnder a bushell , or vnder a bed ? & not to be set on a candlesticke ?
For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested : neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
If any man haue eares to heare , let him heare .
And he said vnto them , Take heed what you heare : With what measure ye mete , it shalbe measured to you : And vnto you that heare , shal more be giuen .
For he that hath , to him shall be giuen : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken , euen that which he hath .
¶ And he said , So is the kingdome of God , as if a man should cast seede into the ground ,
And should sleepe , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring , and grow vp , he knoweth not how .
For the earth bringeth foorth fruite of herselfe , first the blade , then the eare , after that the full corne in the eare .
But when the fruite is brought foorth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the haruest is come .
¶ And he said , Wherunto shal we liken the kingdome of God ? Or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
It is like a graine of mustard seed : which when it is sowen in the earth , is lesse then all the seedes that be in the earth .
But when it is sowen , it groweth vp , and becommeth greater then all herbes , & shooteth out great branches , so that the fowles of the aire may lodge vnder the shadow of it .
And with many such parables spake hee the word vnto them , as they were able to heare it .
But without a parable spake he not vnto them , and when they were alone , hee expounded all things to his disciples .
And the same day , when the Euen was come , he saith vnto them , Let vs passe ouer vnto the other side .
And when they had sent away the multitude , they tooke him , euen as he was in the ship , and there were also with him other litle ships .
And there arose a great storme of wind , and the waues beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
And he was in the hinder part of the ship asleepe on a pillow : and they awake him , and say vnto him , Master , carest thou not , that we perish ?
And hee arose , and rebuked the winde , and said vnto the sea , Peace , be still : and the winde ceased , and there was a great calme .
And he said vnto them , Why are ye so fearefull ? How is it that you haue no faith ?
<NON-VERSE>
And they came ouer vnto the other side of the sea , into the countrey of the Gadarenes .
And when hee was come out of the ship , immediatly there met him out of the tombes , a man with an vncleane spirit ,
Who had his dwelling among the tombs , and no man could binde him , no not with chaines :
Because that hee had bene often bound with fetters and chaines , and the chaines had bene plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
And alwayes night and day , hee was in the mountaines , and in the tombes , crying , and cutting himselfe with stones .
But when hee saw Iesus afarre off , he came and worshipped him ,
And cried with a lowd voice , and said , What haue I to doe with thee , Iesus , thou Sonne of the most high God ? I adiure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
( For he said vnto him , Come out of the man , thou vncleane spirit . )
And he asked him , What is thy name ? And hee answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many .
And hee besought him much , that he would not send them away out of the countrey .
Now there was there nigh vnto the mountaines a great herd of swine , feeding .
And all the deuils besought him , saying , Send vs into the swine , that we may enter into them .
And forthwith Iesus gaue them leaue . And the vncleane spirits went out , and entred into the swine , and the herd ranne violently downe a steepe place into the sea ( they were about two thousand ) and were choked in the sea .
And they that fed the swine fled , and tolde it in the citie , and in the countrey . And they went out to see what it was that was done .
And they come to Iesus , and see him that was possessed with the deuill , and had the Legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right minde : and they were afraid .
And they that saw it , tolde them how it befell to him that was possessed with the deuill , and also concerning the swine .
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
And when hee was come into the ship , he that had bene possessed with the deuill prayed him that hee might bee with him .
Howbeit Iesus suffered him not , but saith vnto him , Goe home to thy friends , and tel them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
And hee departed , and began to publish in Decapolis , how great things Iesus had done for him : and all men did marueile .
And when Iesus was passed ouer againe by ship vnto the other side , much people gathered vnto him , and he was nigh vnto the Sea .
And behold , there commeth one of the Rulers of the Synagogue , Iairus by name , and when he saw him , he fell at his feete ,
And besought him greatly , saying , My litle daughter lieth at the point of death , I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her , that shee may be healed , and she shall liue .
And Iesus went with him , and much people followed him , and thronged him .
And a certaine woman which had an issue of blood twelue yeeres ,
And had suffered many things of many Physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
When shee had heard of Iesus , came in the prease behinde , and touched his garment .
For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shalbe whole .
And straightway the fountaine of her blood was dried vp : and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
And Iesus immediatly knowing in himselfe that vertue had gone out of him , turned him about in the preasse , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
And his disciples said vnto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell downe before him , and tolde him all the trueth .
And he said vnto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole , goe in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
While hee yet spake , there came from the Ruler of the Synagogues house , certaine which said , Thy daughter is dead , why troublest thou the Master any further ?
Assoone as Iesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith vnto the Ruler of the Synagogue , Be not afraid , onely beleeue .
And he suffered no man to follow him , saue Peter , & Iames , and Iohn the brother of Iames .
And hee commeth to the house of the Ruler of the Synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
And when he was come in , hee saith vnto them , Why make yee this adoe , and weepe ? the damosell is not dead , but sleepeth .
And they laughed him to scorne : but when he had put them all out , hee taketh the father and the mother of the damosell , and them that were with him , and entreth in where the damosell was lying .
And he tooke the damosell by the hand , and said vnto her , Talitha cumi , which is , being interpreted , Damosell ( I say vnto thee ) Arise .
And straightway the damosell arose , and walked , for shee was of the age of twelue yeeres : and they were astonished with a great astonishment .
<NON-VERSE>
And hee went out from thence , and came into his owne countrey , and his disciples follow him .
And when the Sabbath day was come , he began to teach in the Synagogue : and many hearing him , were astonished , saying , From whence hath this man these things ? And what wisedome is this which is giuen vnto him , that euen such mightie workes are wrought by his hands ?
Is not this the carpenter , the sonne of Mary , the brother of Iames and Ioses , and of Iuda , and Simon ? And are not his sisters heere with vs ? And they were offended at him .
But Iesus sayde vnto them , A Prophet is not without honour , but in his owne countrey , and among his owne kinne , and in his owne house .
And he could there doe no mightie worke , saue that he laid his hands vpon a few sicke folke , and healed them .
And he marueiled because of their vnbeliefe . And he went round about the villages , teaching .
¶ And he calleth vnto him the twelue , and began to send them foorth , by two and two , and gaue them power ouer vncleane spirits ,
And commanded them that they should take nothing for their iourney , saue a staffe onely : no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
But be shod with sandales : and not put on two coats .
And he said vnto them , In what place soeuer yee enter into an house , there abide til ye depart from that place .
And whosoeuer shall not receiue you , nor heare you , when yee depart thence , shake off the dust vnder your feet , for a testimonie against them : Uerely I say vnto you , it shalbe more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of iudgement , then for that citie .
And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
And they cast out many deuils , and anointed with oyle many , that were sicke , and healed them .
And king Herod heard of him ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and hee said that Iohn the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mightie workes doe shew foorth themselues in him .
Others said , That it is Elias . And others said , That it is a Prophet , or as one of the Prophets .
But when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is Iohn , whome I beheaded , he is risen from the dead .
For Herod himselfe had sent forth and laid hold vpon Iohn , and bound him in prison for Herodias sake , his brother Philips wife , for hee had maried her .
Therfore Herodias had a quarrel against him , & would haue killed him , but she could not .
For Herod feared Iohn , knowing that he was a iust man , and an holy , and obserued him : and when he heard him , hee did many things , and heard him gladly .
And when a conuenient day was come , that Herod on his birth day made a supper to his lords , high captaines , and chiefe estates of Galilee :
And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod , and them that sate with him , the king said vnto the damosell , Aske of me whatsoeuer thou wilt , and I will giue it thee .
And he sware vnto her , Whatsoeuer thou shalt aske of me , I will giue it thee , vnto the halfe of my kingdome .
And she went forth , and said vnto her mother , What shall I aske ? And she said , The head of Iohn the Baptist .
And she came in straightway with haste , vnto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou giue me by and by in a charger , the head of Iohn the Baptist .
And the king was exceeding sory , yet for his othes sake , and for their sakes which sate with him , hee would not reiect her .
And immediatly the king sent an executioner , and commaunded his head to be brought , and he went , and beheaded him in the prison ,
And brought his head in a charger , and gaue it to the damosell , and the damosell gaue it to her mother .
And when his disciples heard of it , they came and tooke vp his corpse , and laid it in a tombe .
And the Apostles gathered themselues together vnto Iesus , and tolde him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
And he said vnto them , Come yee your selues apart into a desert place , and rest a while . For there were many comming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eate .
And they departed into a desert place by ship priuately .
And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ranne afoote thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together vnto him .
And Iesus when he came out , saw much people , and was moued with compassion toward them , because they were as sheepe not hauing a shepherd : and hee beganne to teach them many things .
And when the day was now far spent , his Disciples came vnto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is farre passed .
Send them away , that they may goe into the countrey round about , and into the villages , and buy themselues bread : for they haue nothing to eate .
He answered and said vnto them , Giue yee them to eate . And they say vnto him , Shall we goe and buy two hundred penniworth of bread , and giue them to eate ?
He saith vnto them , How many loaues haue yee ? goe , and see . And when they knew , they say , Fiue , and two fishes .
And he commanded them to make all sit downe by companies vpon the greene grasse .
And they sate downe in rankes by hundreds , and by fifties .
And when he had taken the fiue loaues , and the two fishes , he looked vp to heauen , and blessed , and brake the loaues , and gaue them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes diuided he among them all .
And they did all eate , and were filled .
And they tooke vp twelue baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
And they that did eate of the loaues , were about fiue thousand men .
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to goe to the other side before vnto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
And when hee had sent them away , he departed into a mountaine to pray .
And when Euen was come , the ship was in the midst of the Sea , and he alone on the land .
And he saw them toiling in rowing ( for the wind was contrary vnto them : ) and about the fourth watch of the night , he commeth vnto them , walking vpon the Sea , and would haue passed by them .
But when they saw him walking vpon the Sea , they supposed it had bene a spirit , and cried out .
( For they all saw him , and were troubled ) and immediately hee talked with them , and saith vnto them , Be of good cheere , It is I , be not afraid .
And hee went vp vnto them into the ship , and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselues beyond measure , and wondered .
For they considered not the miracle of the loaues , for their heart was hardened .
And when they had passed ouer , they came into the land of Genesareth , and drew to the shore .
And when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
And ran through that whole region round about , and beganne to carrie about in beds , those that were sicke , where they heard he was .

Then came together vnto him the Pharises , and certain of the Scribes , which came from Hierusalem .
And when they saw some of his disciples eate bread with defiled ( that is to say , with vnwashen ) hands , they found fault .
For the Pharises and all the Iewes , except they wash their hands oft , eate not , holding the tradition of the elders .
And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eate not . And many other things there be , which they haue receiued to hold , as the washing of cups and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
Then the Pharises and Scribes asked him , Why walke not thy disciples according to the tradition of the Elders , but eate bread with vnwashen hands ?
For laying aside the Commandement of God , yee hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots , and cups : and many other such like things ye doe .
And he said vnto them , Full well ye reiect the Commandement of God , that ye may keepe your owne tradition .
For Moses said , Honour thy father & thy mother : and who so curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
But ye say , If a man shall say to his father or mother , It is Corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoeuer thou mightest be profited by me : he shalbe free .
And ye suffer him no more to doe ought for his father , or his mother :
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye haue deliuered : And many such like things doe ye .
¶ And when he had called all the people vnto him , hee said vnto them , Hearken vnto me euery one of you , and vnderstand . There is nothing from without a man that entring into him , can defile him : but the things which come out of of him , those are they that defile the man .
If any man haue eares to heare , let him heare .
And when hee was entred into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
And he saith vnto them , Are ye so without vnderstanding also ? Doe yee not perceiue that whatsoeuer thing from without entreth into the man , it cannot defile him ,
Because it entreth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
And he said , That which commeth out of the man , that defileth the man .
For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed euill thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
Thefts , couetousnesse , wickednesse , deceit , lasciuiousnesse , an euill eye , blasphemie , pride , foolishnesse :
All these euill things come from within , and defile the man .
¶ And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entred into an house , and would haue no man know it , but hee could not be hid .
For a certaine woman , whose yong daughter had an vncleane spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feete .
( The woman was a Greek : a Syrophenician by nation : ) and she besought him that he would cast forth the deuill out of her daughter .
But Iesus said vnto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the childrens bread , and to cast it vnto the dogges .
And she answered and said vnto him , Yes Lord , yet the dogges vnder the table eat of the childrens crummes .
And hee said vnto her , For this saying , goe thy way , the deuill is gone out of thy daughter .
And when shee was come to her house , she found the deuill gone out , and her daughter laied vpon the bed .
¶ And againe departing from the coastes of Tyre and Sidon , he came vnto the sea of Galilee , thorow the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
And they bring vnto him one that was deafe , and had an impediment in his speech : and they beseech him to put his hand vpon him .
And he tooke him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his eares , and he spit , and touched his tongue ,
And looking vp to heauen , hee sighed , and saith vnto him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened .
And straightway his eares were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plaine .
And hee charged them that they should tell no man : but the more hee charged them , so much the more a great deale they published it ,

In those dayes the multitude being very great , and hauing nothing to eat . Iesus called his disciples vnto him , & saith vnto them ,
I haue compassion on the multitude , because they haue now bene with me three daies , and haue nothing to eat :
And if I send them away fasting to their owne houses , they will faint by the way : for diuers of them came from farre .
And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfie these men with bread here in the wildernes ?
And hee asked them , How many loaues haue ye ? And they said , Seuen .
And he commanded the people to sit downe on the ground : and he tooke the seuen loaues , and gaue thanks , and brake , and gaue to his disciples to set before them : and they did set them before the people .
And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commaunded to set them also before them .
So they did eate , and were filled : and they tooke vp , of the broken meate that was left , seuen baskets .
And they that had eaten were about foure thousand , and he sent them away .
¶ And straightway he entred into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
And the Pharisees came foorth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a signe from heauen , tempting him .
And he sighed deepely in his spirit , and saith , Why doeth this generation seeke after a signe ? Uerely I say vnto you , There shall no signe be giuen vnto this generation .
And he left them , & entring into the ship againe , departed to the other side .
¶ Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more then one loafe .
And hee charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leauen of the Pharisees , and of the leauen of Herode .
And they reasoned among themselues , saying , It is , because we haue no bread .
And when Iesus knew it , he saith vnto them , Why reason ye , because yee haue no bread ? Perceiue ye not yet , neither vnderstand ? Haue yee your heart yet hardened ?
Hauing eyes , see ye not ? and hauing eares heare ye not ? And doe ye not remember ?
When I brake the fiue loaues among fiue thousand , how many baskets full of fragments tooke yee vp ? They say vnto him , Twelue .
And when the seuen among foure thousand : how many baskets full of fragments tooke ye vp ? And they said , Seuen .
And he said vnto them , How is it that ye doe not vnderstand ?
¶ And he commeth to Bethsaida , and they bring a blind man vnto him , and besought him to touch him :
And he tooke the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the towne , and when he had spit on his eyes , & put his hands vpon him , he asked him , if hee saw ought .
And he looked vp , and saide , I see men as trees , walking .
After that hee put his handes againe vpon his eies , and made him look vp : and he was restored , and saw euery man clearely .
And hee sent him away to his house , saying , Neither goe into the towne , nor tell it to any in the towne .
¶ And Iesus went out , and his disciples , into the townes of Cesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying vnto them , Whom doe men say that I am ?
And they answered , Iohn the Baptist : but some say , Elias : & others , one of the Prophets .
And hee saith vnto them , But whom say yee that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith vnto him , Thou art the Christ .
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
And hee beganne to teach them , that the Sonne of man must suffer many things , and be reiected of the Elders , and of the chiefe Priests , & Scribes , and be killed , & after three dayes rise againe .
And he spake that saying openly . And Peter tooke him , and beganne to rebuke him .
But when he had turned about , and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou sauourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
¶ And when he had called the people vnto him , with his disciples also , he said vnto them , Whosoeuer will come after me , let him denie himselfe , and take vp his crosse and follow mee .
For whosoeuer will saue his life shall lose it , but whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels , the same shall saue it .
For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gaine the whole world , and lose his owne soule ?
Or what shall a man giue in exchange for his soule ?

And hee said vnto them , Uerely I say vnto you , that there be some of them that stand here , which shal not taste of death , till they haue seene the kingdome of God come with power .
¶ And after sixe dayes , Iesus taketh with him Peter , and Iames , and Iohn , and leadeth them vp into an high mountaine apart by themselues : and he was transfigured before them .
And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow : so as no Fuller on earth can white them .
And there appeared vnto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Iesus .
And Peter answered , and saide to Iesus , Master , it is good for vs to bee here , and let vs make three Tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
For he wist not what to say , for they were sore afraid .
And there was a cloud that ouershadowed them : and a voyce came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloued Sonne : heare him .
And suddenly when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , saue Iesus only with themselues .
And as they came downe from the mountaine , he charged them that they should tell no man , what things they had seene , till the Sonne of man were risen from the dead .
And they kept that saying with themselues , questioning one with another , what the rising from the dead should meane .
¶ And they asked him , saying , Why say the Scribes that Elias must first come ?
And he answered , and told them , Elias verely commeth first , and restoreth al things , and how it is written of the Sonne of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
But I say vnto you , that Elias is indeed come , and they haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they listed , as it is written of him .
¶ And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the Scribes questioning with them .
And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , & running to him , saluted him .
And he asked the Scribes , What question ye with them ?
And one of the multitude answered , and said , Master , I haue broughe vnto thee my son , which hath a dumbe spirit :
And wheresoeuer he taketh him , he teareth him , & he fometh , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples , that they should cast him out , and they could not .
He answereth him , and saith , O faithlesse generation , how long shall I be with you , how long shall I suffer you ? Bring him vnto me .
And they brought him vnto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him , and he fel on the ground , and wallowed , foming .
And he asked his father , Howe long is it agoe since this came vnto him ? And he said , Of a child .
And oft times it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters to destroy him : but if thou canst doe any thing , haue compassion on vs , and helpe vs .
Iesus said vnto him , If thou canst beleeue , all things are possible to him that beleeueth .
And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with teares , Lord , I beleeue , helpe thou mine vnbeliefe .
When Iesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foule spirit , saying vnto him , Thou dumbe and deafe spirit , I charge thee come out of him , and enter no more into him .
And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him , and he was as one dead , insomuch that many said , He is dead .
But Iesus tooke him by the hand , and lifted him vp , and he arose .
And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him priuately , Why could not we cast him out ?
And hee said vnto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer , and fasting .
¶ And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee , and he would not that any man should know it .
For he taught his disciples , and said vnto them , The sonne of man is deliuered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him , and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
But they vnderstood not that saying , and were afraid to aske him .
¶ And he came to Capernaum ; and being in the house , he asked them , What was it that yee disputed among your selues by the way ?
But they held their peace : For by the way they had disputed among themselues , who should be the greatest .
And he sate downe , and called the twelue , and saith vnto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and seruant of all .
And he tooke a child , and set him in the midst of them : & when he had taken him in his arms , he said vnto them ,
Whosoeuer shall receiue one of such children in my Name , receiueth me : and whosoeuer shall receiue me , receiueth not me , but him that sent me .
¶ And Iohn answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out deuils in thy Name , and he followeth not vs , and we forbade him , because he followeth not vs .
But Iesus said , Forbid him not , for there is no man , which shall doe a miracle in my Name , that can lightly speake euill of me .
For he that is not against vs , is on our part .
For whosoeuer shall giue you a cup of water to drinke in my Name , because yee belong to Christ : Uerily I say vnto you , he shall not lose his reward .
And whosoeuer shall offend one of these litle ones that beleeue in me , it is better for him , that a milstone were hanged about his necke , and he were cast into the Sea . And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : It is better for thee to enter into life maimed , then hauing two hands , to goe into hell , into the fire that neuer shall be quenched :
Where their worme dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
And if thy foote offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , then hauing two feete , to be cast into hell , into the fire that neuer shall be quenched : Where their worme dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , then hauing two eyes , to be cast into helfire :
Where their worme dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . For euery one shall be salted with fire , and euery sacrifice shall be salted with salt .

And he rose from thence , & commeth into the coasts of Iudea by the farther side of Iordan : and the people resort vnto him againe , and as he was wont , he taught them againe .
¶ And the Pharises came to him , and asked him , Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
And he answered , and saide vnto them , What did Moses command you ?
And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of diuorcement , and to put her away .
And Iesus answered , and said vnto them , For the hardnesse of your heart , he wrote you this precept .
But from the beginning of the creation , God made them male , and female .
For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother , and cleaue to his wife ,
And they twaine shalbe one flesh : so then they are no more twaine , but one flesh .
What therefore God hath ioyned together , let not man put asunder .
And in the house his disciples asked him againe of the same matter .
And he saith vnto them , Whosoeuer shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
And if a woman shall put away her husband , and bee married to another , she committeth adulterie .
¶ And they brought yong children to him , that he should touch them , and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
But when Iesus saw it , hee was much displeased , and said vnto them , Suffer the little children to come vnto mee , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdome of God .
Uerily I say vnto you , Whosoeuer shall not receiue the kingdome of God as a little childe , he shall not enter therein .
And hee tooke them vp in his armes , put his handes vpon them , and blessed them .
¶ And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good master , what shall I doe that I may inherit eternall life ?
And Iesus said vnto him , Why callest thou me good ? There is no man good , but one , that is God .
Thou knowest the Commandements , Doe not commit adulterie , Doe not kill , Doe not steale , Doe not beare false witnesse , Defraud not , Honour thy father , and mother .
And hee answered , and saide vnto him , Master , all these haue I obserued from my youth .
Then Iesus beholding him , loued him , and said vnto him , One thing thou lackest ; Goe thy way , sell whatsoeuer thou hast , and giue to the poore , and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen , and come , take vp the crosse & folow me .
And hee was sad at that saying , and went away grieued : for hee had great possessions .
¶ And Iesus looked round about , and saith vnto his disciples , How hardly shall they that haue riches enter into the kingdome of God ?
And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Iesus answereth againe , and saith vnto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches , to enter into the kingdom of God ?
It is easier for a camel to goe thorow the eye of a needle , then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselues , Who then can be saued ?
And Iesus looking vpon them , saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
¶ Then Peter began to say vnto him , Loe , we haue left all , and haue followed thee .
And Iesus answered , and said , Uerily I say vnto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the Gospels ,
But hee shall receiue an hundred fold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternall life :
But many that are first , shall be last : and the last , first .
¶ And they were in the way going vp to Hierusalem : and Iesus went before them , and they were amazed , and as they followed , they were afraid : and he tooke againe the twelue , and began to tell them what things should happen vnto him ,
Saying , Behold , we go vp to Hierusalem , and the Sonne of man shall be deliuered vnto the chiefe Priests , and vnto the Scribes : and they shall condemne him to death , and shall deliuer him to the Gentiles .
And they shall mocke him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit vpon him , and shall kill him , and the third day he shall rise againe .
¶ And Iames , and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee come vnto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for vs whatsoeuer we shall desire .
And hee saide vnto them , What would ye that I should doe for you ?
They said vnto him , Grant vnto vs that wee may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
But Iesus said vnto them , Yee know not what ye aske : Can ye drinke of the cup that I drinke of ? and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with ?
And they said vnto him , Wee can . And Iesus said vnto them , Ye shall indeed drinke of the cup that I drinke of : and with the baptisme that I am baptized withall , shall ye be baptized :
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand , is not mine to giue , but it shall be giuen to them for whom it is prepared .
And when the ten heard it , they beganne to bee much displeased with Iames and Iohn .
But Iesus called them to him , and saith vnto them , Yee know that they which are accompted to rule ouer the Gentiles , exercise Lordship ouer them : and their great ones exercise authoritie vpon them .
But so shall it not be among you : but whosoeuer will bee great among you , shall be your minister :
And whosoeuer of you will bee the chiefest , shalbe seruant of all .
For euen the Sonne of man came not to bee ministred vnto , but to minister , and to giue his life a ransome for many .
¶ And they came to Iericho : and as he went out of Iericho with his disciples , and a great number of people ; blinde Bartimeus , the son of Timeus , sate by the high wayes side , begging .
And when he heard that it was Iesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Iesus thou Sonne of Dauid , haue mercie on me .
And many charged him , that he should hold his peace : But he cried the more a great deale , Thou Sonne of Dauid , haue mercy on me .
And Iesus stood still , and commanded him to bee called : and they call the blinde man , saying vnto him , Be of good comfort , rise , he calleth thee .
And hee casting away his garment , rose , and came to Iesus .
And Iesus answered , and said vnto him , What wilt thou that I should doe vnto thee ? The blinde man said vnto him , Lord , that I might receiue my sight .

And when they came nigh to Hierusalem , vnto Bethphage , and Bethanie , at the mount of Oliues , hee sendeth foorth two of his disciples ,
And saith vnto them , Goe your way into the village ouer against you , and assoone as ye bee entred into it , yee shall finde a colt tied , whereon neuer man sate , loose him , and bring him .
And if any man say vnto you , Why doe yee this ? Say yee , that the Lord hath need of him : and straightway he will send him hither .
And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the doore without , in a place where two wayes met : and they loose him .
And certaine of them that stood there , said vnto them , What doe ye loosing the colt ?
And they said vnto them euen as Iesus had commanded : and they let them goe .
And they brought the colt to Iesus , and cast their garments on him , and he sate vpon him .
And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut downe branches of the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And they that went before , and they that followed , cryed , saying , Hosanna , blessed is hee that commeth in the Name of the Lord .
Blessed be the kingdome of our father Dauid , that commeth in the Name of the Lord , Hosanna in the highest .
And Iesus entred into Hierusalem , and into the Temple , and when hee had looked round about vpon all things , & now the euentide was come , he went out vnto Bethanie with the twelue .
¶ And on the morow when they were come from Bethanie , hee was hungry .
And seeing a figtree a farre off , hauing leaues , hee came , if haply hee might find any thing thereon , & when he came to it , hee found nothing but leaues : for the time of figs was not yet .
And Iesus answered , and said vnto it , No man eate fruite of thee hereafter for euer . And his disciples heard it .
¶ And they come to Hierusalem , and Iesus went into the Temple , and beganne to cast out them that sold and bought in the Temple , and ouerthrew the tables of the money changers , and the seats of them that sold doues ,
And would not suffer that any man should carie any vessell thorow the Temple .
And he taught , saying vnto them , Is it not written , My house shalbe called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye haue made it a den of theeues .
And the Scribes and chiefe Priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
And when Euen was come , Hee went out of the citie .
¶ And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried vp from the roots .
And Peter calling to remembrance saith vnto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst , is withered away .
And Iesus answering , saith vnto them , Haue faith in God .
For verely I say vnto you , that whosoeuer shall say vnto this mountaine , Bee thou remoued , and bee thou cast into the sea , and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall beleeue that those things which hee saith , shall come to passe : he shal haue whatsoeuer he saith .
Therfore I say vnto you , What things soeuer ye desire when ye pray , beleeue that ye receiue them , and ye shall haue them . And when ye stand , praying , forgiue , if ye haue ought against any : that your Father also which is in heauen , may forgiue you your trespasses .
But if you doe not forgiue , neither will your Father which is in heauen , forgiue your trespasses .
¶ And they come againe to Hierusalem , and as he was walking in the Temple , there come to him the chiefe Priests , and the Scribes , & the Elders ,
And say vnto him , By what authoritie doest thou these things ? and who gaue thee this authority to doe these things ?
And Iesus answered , and saide vnto them , I will also aske of you one question , and answere me , and I will tell you by what authoritie I doe these things .
The baptisme of Iohn , was it from heauen , or of men ? Answere me .
And they reasoned with themselues , saying , If we shall say , From heauen , he will say , Why then did ye not beleeue him ?
But if we shall say , Of men , they feared the people : for all men counted Iohn , that he was a Prophet indeed .

And hee began to speake vnto them by parables . A certaine man planted a vineyard , and set an hedge about it , and digged a place for the wine fat , and built a towre , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a farre countrey .
And at the season , he sent to the husbandmen a seruant , that he might receiue from the husbandmen of the fruite of the vineyard . And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away emptie .
And againe , hee sent vnto them another seruant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
And againe , he sent another , and him they killed : and many others , beating some , and killing some .
Hauing yet therefore one sonne his welbeloued , he sent him also last vnto them , saying , They will reuerence my sonne .
But those husbandmen said amongst themselues , This is the heire , come , let vs kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
And they tooke him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
What shall therefore the Lord of the vineyard doe ? He will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will giue the vineyard vnto others .
And haue ye not read this Scripture ? The stone which the builders reiected , is become the head of the corner :
This was the Lords doing , and it is maruellous in our eies .
And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people , for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
Shall we giue , or shall we not giue ? But he knowing their hypocrisie , said vnto them , Why tempt yee mee ? Bring me a penny that I may see it .
And they brought it : and he saith vnto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said vnto him , Cesars .
And Iesus answering , said vnto them , Render to Cesar the things that are Cesars : and to God the things that are Gods . And they maruailed at him .
¶ Then come vnto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection , and they asked him , saying ,
Master , Moses wrote vnto vs , If a mans brother die , and leaue his wife behind him , and leaue no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise vp seed vnto his brother .
And the seuen had her , and left no seede : last of all the woman died also .
In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seuen had her to wife .
And Iesus answering , said vnto them , Doe ye not therefore erre , because yee know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ?
For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are giuen in marriage : but are as the Angels which are in heauen .
And as touching the dead , that they rise : haue ye not read in the booke of Moses , how in the bush God spake vnto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isahac , and the God of Iacob ?
Hee is not the God of the dead , but the God of the liuing : yee therefore doe greatly erre .
¶ And one of the Scribes came , and hauing heard them reasoning together , and perceiuing that he had answered them well , asked him which is the first commandement of all .
And Iesus answered him , The first of al the commandements is , Heare , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord :
And thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soule , and with all thy minde , and with all thy strength : This is the first commandement .
And the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe : there is none other commandement greater then these .
And the Scribe said vnto him , Well master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God , and there is none other but he .
And to loue him with all the heart , and with all the vnderstanding , and with all the soule , and with all the strength , and to loue his neighbour as himselfe , is more then all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
And when Iesus saw that he answered discreetly , hee saide vnto him , Thou art not far from the kingdome of God . And no man after that durst aske him any question .
¶ And Iesus answered , and said , while hee taught in the Temple , How say the Scribes that Christ is the sonne of Dauid ?
For Dauid himselfe said by the holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , til I make thine enemies thy footstoole .
Dauid therefore himselfe calleth him Lord , and whence is hee then his sonne ? And the common people heard him gladly .
¶ And he said vnto them in his doctrine , Beware of the Scribes , which loue to goe in long clothing , and loue salutations in the market places ,
And the chiefe seates in the Synagogues , and the vppermost roomes at feasts :
Which deuoure widowes houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : These shall receiue greater damnation .
¶ And Iesus sate ouer against the treasurie , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasurie : and many that were rich , cast in much .
And there came a certaine poore widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
And he called vnto him his disciples , and saith vnto them , Uerily I say vnto you , that this poore widow hath cast more in , then all they which haue cast into the treasurie .

And as he went out of the Temple , one of his disciples saith vnto him , Master , see what maner of stones , and what buildings are here .
And Iesus answering , said vnto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone vpon an other , that shal not be throwen downe .
And as he sate vpon the mount of Oliues , ouer against the Temple , Peter , and Iames , and Iohn , and Andrew asked him priuately ,
Tell vs , when shall these things be ? And what shalbe the signe when all these things shalbe fulfilled ?
And Iesus answering them , began to say , Take heed lest any man deceiue you .
For many shal come in my Name , saying , I am Christ : and shall deceiue many .
And when yee shall heare of warres , and rumors of warres , be yee not troubled : For such things must needs be , but the end shall not be yet .
For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdome against kingdome : and there shalbe earthquakes in diuers places , and there shall be famines , and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrowes .
¶ But take heed to your selues : for they shall deliuer you vp to councels , and in the Synagogues ye shall be beaten , and ye shalbe brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
And the Gospel must first be published among all nations .
But when they shall lead you , and deliuer you vp , take no thought before hand what ye shall speake , neither doe yee premeditate : but whatsoeuer shall bee giuen you in that houre , that speake yee : for it is not yee that speake , but the holy Ghost .
Now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the sonne : and children shall rise vp against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
And ye shall bee hated of all men for my Names sake : but hee that shall endure vnto the ende , the same shall be saued .
¶ But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet , standing where it ought not ( let him that readeth vnderstand ) then let them that be in Iudea , flee to the mountaines :
And let him that is on the house top , not goe downe into the house , neither enter therin , to take any thing out of his house .
And let him that is in the field , not turne backe againe for to take vp his garment .
But woe to them that are with child , and to them that giue suck in those dayes .
And pray ye that your flight bee not in the winter .
For in those dayes shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created , vnto this time , neither shall be .
And except that the Lord had shortened those dayes , no flesh should be saued : but for the elects sake whome he hath chosen , he hath shortned the daies .
And then , if any man shall say to you , Loe , here is Christ , or loe , hee is there : beleeue him not .
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shewe signes and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , euen the elect .
But take ye heed : behold , I haue foretold you all things .
¶ But in those dayes , after that tribulation , the Sunne shalbe darkned , and the Moone shall not giue her light .
And the Starres of heauen shall fall , and the powers that are in heauen shall be shaken .
And then shal they see the Sonne of man comming in the cloudes , with great power and glory .
And then shal he send his Angels , and shall gather together his elect from the foure winds , from the vttermost part of the earth , to the vttermost part of heauen .
Now learne a parable of the fig tree . When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaues , ye know that summer is neere :
So ye in like maner , when ye shal see these things come to passe , knowe that it is nigh , euen at the doores .
Uerely I say vnto you , that this generation shall not passe , till all these things be done .
Heauen and earth shal passe away : but my words shall not passe away .
¶ But of that day and that houre knoweth no man , no not the Angels which are in heauen , neither the Son , but the Father .
Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
For the Sonne of man is as a man taking a farre iourney , who left his house , and gaue authority to his seruants , and to euery man his worke , and commanded the porter to watch :
Watch ye therefore ( for ye knowe not when the master of the house commeth , at Euen , or at midnight , or at the cocke crowing , or in the morning . )
Lest comming suddenly , he finde you sleeping .

After two dayes was the feast of the Passeouer , and of vnleauened bread : and the chiefe Priests , and the Scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an vprore of the people .
¶ And being in Bethanie , in the house of Simon the leper , as he sate at meat , there came a woman , hauing an Alabaster boxe of oyntment of spikenard very precious , and shee brake the boxe , and powred it on his head .
And there were some that had indignation within themselues , and said , Why was this waste of the oyntment made ?
For it might haue bene solde for more then three hundred pence , and haue bene giuen to the poore : and they murmured against her .
And Iesus said , Let her alone , why trouble you her ? Shee hath wrought a good worke on me .
For ye haue the poore with you alwayes , and whensoeuer ye will yee may doe them good : but me ye haue not alwayes .
She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
Uerely I say vnto you , Wheresoeuer this Gospel shalbe preached thorowout the whole world , this also that she hath done , shall be spoken of for a memoriall of her .
¶ And Iudas Iscariot , one of the twelue , went vnto the chiefe Priests , to betray him vnto them .
And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to giue him money . And he sought how he might conueniently betray him .
¶ And the first day of vnleauened bread , when they killed the Passeouer , his disciples said vnto him , Where wilt thou that we goe , and prepare , that thou mayest eate the Passeouer ?
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith vnto them , Goe yee into the citie , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
And wheresoeuer he shall goe in , say yee to the good man of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guest chamber , where I shall eate the Passeouer with my disciples ?
And he will shew you a large vpper roome furnished , and prepared : there make ready for vs .
And his disciples went forth , and came into the citie , and found as hee had said vnto them : and they made readie the Passeouer .
And in the euening hee commeth with the twelue .
And as they sate , and did eat , Iesus said , Uerily I say vnto you , one of you which eateth with me , shall betray mee .
And they began to be sorowfull , and to say vnto him , one by one , Is it I ? And another said , Is it I ?
And he answered , and saide vnto them , It is one of the twelue , that dippeth with me in the dish .
The sonne of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed : Good were it for that man , if he had neuer bene borne .
¶ And as they did eate , Iesus tooke bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gaue to them , and said , Take , eate : this is my body .
And he tooke the cup , and when he had giuen thanks , he gaue it to them : and they all dranke of it .
And he said vnto them , This is my blood of the new Testament , which is shed for many .
Uerely I say vnto you , I will drinke no more of the fruit of the Uine , vntill that day that I drinke it new in the kingdome of God .
¶ And when they had sung an hymne , they went out into the mount of Oliues .
And Iesus saith vnto them , All ye shall be offended because of mee this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepheard , and the sheepe shall be scattered .
But after that I am risen , I will goe before you into Galilee .
But Peter said vnto him , Although al shalbe offended , yet wil not I .
And Iesus saith vnto him , Uerily I say vnto thee , that this day , euen in this night before the cocke crow twise , thou shalt denie me thrise .
But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not denie thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all .
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemani , and hee saith to his disciples , Sit yee here , while I shall pray .
And hee taketh with him Peter , and Iames , and Iohn , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heauy ,
And saith vnto them , My soule is exceeding sorowful vnto death : tarie ye here , and watch .
And he went forward a litle , and fell on the ground , and prayed , that if it were possible , the houre might passe from him .
And he said , Abba , father , all things are possible vnto thee , take away this cup from me : Neuerthelesse , not that I will , but what thou wilt .
And hee commeth , and findeth them sleeping , and saith vnto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? Couldest not thou watch one houre ?
Watch ye and pray , lest yee enter into temptation : The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weake .
And againe he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
And when he returned , he found them asleepe againe , ( for their eies were heauie ) neither wist they what to answere him .
And he commeth the third time , and saith vnto them , Sleepe on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the houre is come , behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
Rise vp , let vs goe , Loe , he that betrayeth me , is at hand .
¶ And immediately , while hee yet spake , commeth Iudas , one of the twelue , and with him a great multitude with swords , and staues , from the chiefe Priests , and the Scribes , & the Elders .
And he that betrayed him , had giuen them a token , saying , Whomsoeuer I shall kisse , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
And assoone as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and sayeth , Master , Master , and kissed him .
¶ And they layed their hands on him , and tooke him .
And one of them that stood by , drew a sword , and smote a seruant of the high Priest , and cut off his eare .
And Iesus answered , & said vnto them , Are ye come out as against a theefe , with swords , & with staues to take me ?
I was daily with you in the Temple , teaching , and yee tooke me not ; but the Scriptures must be fulfilled .
And they all forsooke him , & fled .
And there followed him a certaine yong man , hauing a linnen cloth cast about his naked body , and the yong men laid hold on him .
And he left the linnen cloth , and fled from them naked .
¶ And they led Iesus away to the high Priest , and with him were assembled all the chiefe Priests , and the Elders , and the Scribes .
And Peter followed him a farre off , euen into the pallace of the high Priest : and he sate with the seruants , and warmed himselfe at the fire .
And the chiefe Priests , and all the counsell sought for witnesse against Iesus , to put him to death , & found none .
For many bare false witnesse against him , but their witnesse agreed not together .
And there arose certaine , and bare false witnesse against him , saying ,
We heard him say , I will destroy this Temple that is made with hands , and within three dayes I will build another made without hands .
But neither so did their witnesse agree together .
And the high Priest stood vp in the mids , and asked Iesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? What is it which these witnesse against thee ?
But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Againe , the high Priest asked him , and said vnto him , Art thou the Christ , the sonne of the Blessed ?
And Iesus said , I am : and yee shall see the sonne of man sitting on the right hand of power , and comming in the clouds of heauen .
Then the high Priest rent his clothes , and saith , What neede we any further witnesses ?
Yee haue heard the blasphemy : what thinke yee ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
And some beganne to spit on him , and to couer his face , and to buffet him , and to say vnto him , Prophecie : And the seruants did stricke him with the palmes of their hands .
¶ And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there commeth one of the maides of the high Priest .
And when she saw Peter warning himselfe , she looked vpon him , and said , And thou also wast with Iesus of Nazareth .
But hee denied , saying , I know not , neither vnderstand I what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch , and the cocke crew .
And a maide saw him againe , and beganne to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
And he denied it againe . And a little after , they that stood by said againe to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilean , and thy speach agreeth thereto .
But he beganne to curse and to sweare , saying , I know not this man of whom yee speake .
<NON-VERSE>
And straightway in the morning the chiefe Priests helde a consultation with the Elders and Scribes , and the whole Councell , and bound Iesus , and caried him away , and deliuered him to Pilate .
And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Iewes ? And hee answering , said vnto him , Thou sayest it .
And the chiefe Priests accused him of many things : but hee answered nothing .
And Pilate asked him againe , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witnesse against thee .
But Iesus yet answered nothing , so that Pilate marueiled .
Now at that Feast he released vnto them one prisoner , whomsoeuer they desired .
And there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
And the multitude crying alowd , began to desire him to doe as he had euer done vnto them .
But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release vnto you the King of the Iewes ?
( For hee knew that the chiefe Priests had deliuered him for enuie . )
But the chiefe Priests mooued the people , that hee should rather release Barabbas vnto them .
And Pilate answered , and said againe vnto them , What will yee then that I shall do vnto him whom ye call the King of the Iewes ?
And they cried out againe , Crucifie him .
Then Pilate saide vnto them , Why , what euill hath hee done ? And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucifie him .
¶ And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas vnto them , and deliuered Iesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
And the souldiers led him away into the hall , called Pretorium , and they call together the whole band .
And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crowne of thornes , and put it about his head ,
And beganne to salute him , Haile King of the Iewes .
And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit vpon him , and bowing their knees , worshipped him .
And when they had mocked him , they tooke off the purple from him , and put his owne clothes on him , and led him out to crucifie him .
And they compell one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , comming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to beare his Crosse .
And they bring him vnto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , the place of a skull .
And they gaue him to drinke , wine mingled with myrrhe : but he receiued it not .
And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots vpon them , what euery man should take .
And it was the third houre , and they crucified him .
And the superscription of his accusation was written ouer , THE KING OF THE IEWES .
And with him they crucifie two theeues , the one on his right hand , and the other on his left . And the Scripture was fulfilled , which sayeth , And hee was numbred with the transgressours .
And they that passed by , railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah thou that destroyest the Temple , and buildest it in three dayes ,
Saue thy selfe , and come downe from the Crosse .
Likewise also the chiefe Priests mocking , said among themselues with the Scribes , He saued others , himselfe he cannot saue .
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the Crosse , that we may see and beleeue : And they that were crucified with him , reuiled him .
And when the sixth houre was come , there was darkenesse ouer the whole land , vntill the ninth houre .
And at the ninth houre , Iesus cryed with a loude voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lamasabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
And one ranne , and filled a spunge full of vineger , and put it on a reed , and gaue him to drinke , saying , Let alone , let vs see whether Elias will come to take him downe .
And Iesus cryed with a loude voice , and gaue vp the ghost .
And the vaile of the Temple was rent in twaine , from the top to the bottome .
¶ And when the Centurion which stood ouer against him , saw that hee so cryed out , and gaue vp the ghost , hee said , Truely this man was the Sonne of God .
There were also women looking on afarre off , among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of Iames the lesse , and of Ioses , and Salome :
Who also when hee was in Galile , followed him , and ministred vnto him , and many other women which came vp with him vnto Hierusalem .
¶ And now when the euen was come , ( because it was the Preparation , that is , the day before the Sabbath )
Ioseph of Arimathea , an honourable counseller , which also waited for the kingdome of God , came , and went in boldly vnto Pilate , and craued the body of Iesus .
And Pilate marueiled if he were already dead , and calling vnto him the Centurion , hee asked him whether hee had beene any while dead .
And when he knew it of the Centurion , he gaue the body to Ioseph .
And hee bought fine linnen , and tooke him downe , and wrapped him in the linnen , and laide him in a sepulchre , which was hewen out of a rocke , and rolled a stone vnto the doore of the sepulchre .
<NON-VERSE>
And when the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of Iames , and Salome , had bought sweete spices , that they might come and anoint him .
And very early in the morning , the first day of the week they came vnto the sepulchre , at the rising of the sunne :
And they said among themselues , who shall roll vs away the stone from the doore of the sepulchre ?
( And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away ) for it was very great .
And entring into the sepulchre , they sawe a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment , and they were affrighted .
And hee sayth vnto them , Be not affrighted ; ye seeke Iesus of Nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen , hee is not here : behold the place where they laide him .
But goe your way , tell his disciples , and Peter , that hee goeth before you into Galile , there shall ye see him , as he said vnto you .
And they went out quickely , and fledde from the sepulchre , for they trembled , and were amazed , neither sayd they any thing to any man , for they were afraid .
¶ Now when Iesus was risen early , the first day of the weeke , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seuen deuils .
And she went and told them that had beene with him , as they mourned and wept .
And they , when they had heard that he was aliue , and had beene seene of her , beleeued not .
¶ After that , he appeared in another forme vnto two of them , as they walked , and went into the countrey .
And they went and tolde it vnto the residue , neither beleeued they them .
¶ Afterward he appeared vnto the eleuen , as they sate at meat , and vpbraided them with their vnbeliefe , and hardnesse of heart , because they beleeued not them , which had seene him after he was risen .
And he said vnto them , Goe yee into all the world , and preach the Gospel to euery creature .
He that beleeueth and is baptized , shalbe saued , but he that beleeueth not , shall be damned .
And these signes shal follow them that beleeue , In my Name shall they cast out deuils , they shall speake with new tongues ,
They shall take vp serpents , and if they drinke any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them , they shall lay hands on the sicke , and they shall recouer .
¶ So then after the Lord had spoken vnto them , he was receiued vp into heauen , and sate on the right hand of God .

The booke of the generation of Iesus Christ , the sonne of Dauid , the sonne of Abraham .
Abraham begate Isaac , and Isaac begate Iacob , and Iacob begate Iudas and his brethren . And Iudas begate Phares and Zara of Thamar , and Phares begate Esrom , and Esrom begate Aram .
And Aram begate Aminadab , and Aminadab begate Naasson , and Naasson begate Salmon .
And Salmon begat Boos of Rachab , and Boos begate Obed of Ruth , and Obed begate Iesse .
And Eliud begate Eleazar , and Eleazar begate Matthan , and Matthan begate Iacob .
And Iacob begate Ioseph the husband of Mary , of whom was borne Iesus , who is called Christ .
So all the generations from Abraham to Dauid , are fourteene generations : and from Dauid vntill the carying away into Babylon , are foureteene generations : and from the carying away into Babylon vnto Christ , are fourteene generations .
¶ Now the birth of Iesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Ioseph ( before they came together ) shee was found with childe of the holy Ghost .
Then Ioseph her husband being a iust man , and not willing to make her a publique example , was minded to put her away priuily .
But while hee thought on these things , behold , the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him in a dreame , saying , Ioseph thou sonne of Dauid , feare not to take vnto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceiued in her , is of the holy Ghost .
And she shall bring forth a sonne , and thou shalt call his Name Iesus : for hee shall saue his people from their sinnes .
( Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet , saying ,
Behold , a Uirgin shall be with childe , and shall bring foorth a sonne , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted , is , God with vs . )
Then Ioseph , being raised from sleepe , did as the Angel of the Lord had bidden him , & tooke vnto him his wife :
<NON-VERSE>
Now when Iesus was borne in Bethlehem of Iudea , in the dayes of Herod the king , behold , there came Wise men from the East to Hierusalem ,
Saying , Where is he that is borne King of the Iewes ? for we haue seene his Starre in the East , and are come to worship him .
When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Hierusalem with him .
And when he had gathered all the chiefe Priests and Scribes of the people together , hee demanded of them where Christ should be borne .
And they said vnto him , In Bethlehem of Iudea : For thus it is written by the Prophet ;
And thou Bethlehem in the land of Iuda , art not the least among the Princes of Iuda : for out of thee shall come a Gouernour , that shall rule my people Israel .
Then Herod , when he had priuily called the Wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the Starre appeared :
And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Goe , and search diligently for the yong child , and when ye haue found him , bring me word againe , that I may come and worship him also .
When they had heard the King , they departed , and loe , the Starre which they saw in the East , went before them , till it came and stood ouer where the young childe was .
When they saw the Starre , they reioyced with exceeding great ioy .
¶ And when they were come into the house , they saw the yong child with Mary his mother , and fell downe , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented vnto him gifts , gold , and frankincense , and myrrhe .
And being warned of God in a dreame , that they should not returne to Herode , they departed into their owne countrey another way .
And when they were departed , behold , the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Ioseph in a dreame , saying , Arise and take the young childe , and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and bee thou there vntill I bring thee word : for Herode will seeke the young childe , to destroy him .
When he arose , he tooke the yong childe and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
And was there vntill the death of Herode , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet , saying , Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne .
¶ Then Herode , when hee saw that hee was mocked of the Wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent foorth , and slewe all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two yeeres olde and vnder , according to the time , which he had diligently enquired of the Wise men .
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremie the Prophet , saying ,
In Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
¶ But when Herode was dead , behold , an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a dreame to Ioseph in Egypt ,
Saying , Arise , and take the yong childe and his mother , and goe into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the yong childes life .
And he arose , and tooke the yong childe and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
But when he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in the roome of his father Herod , hee was afraid to goe thither : notwithstanding , beeing warned of God in a dreame , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
<NON-VERSE>
In those daies came Iohn the Baptist , preaching in the wildernesse of Iudea ,
And saying , Repent yee : for the kingdome of heauen is at hand .
For this is he that was spoken of by the Prophet Esaias , saying , The voyce of one crying in the wildernes , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
And the same Iohn had his raiment of camels haire , and a leatherne girdle about his loynes , and his meate was locusts and wilde hony .
Then went out to him Hierusalem , and all Iudea , and all the region round about Iordane ,
And were baptized of him in Iordane , confessing their sinnes .
¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his Baptisme , he said vnto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance .
And thinke not to say within your selues , Wee haue Abraham to our father : For I say vnto you , that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham .
And now also the axe is layd vnto the root of the trees : Therefore euery tree which bringeth not foorth good fruite , is hewen downe , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you with water vnto repentance : but he that commeth after mee , is mightier then I , whose shooes I am not worthy to beare , hee shall baptize you with the holy Ghost , and with fire .
Whose fanne is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floore , and gather his wheat into the garner : but wil burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fire .
¶ Then commeth Iesus from Galilee to Iordane , vnto Iohn , to be baptized of him :
But Iohn forbade him , saying , I haue need to bee baptized of thee , and commest thou to me ?
And Iesus answering , said vnto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnesse . Then he suffered him .
And Iesus , when hee was baptized , went vp straightway out of the water : and loe , the heauens were opened vnto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a doue , and lighting vpon him .
<NON-VERSE>
Then was Iesus led vp of the Spirit into the wildernesse , to bee tempted of the deuill .
And when hee had fasted forty dayes and forty nights , hee was afterward an hungred .
And when the tempter came to him , hee said , If thou be the sonne of God , command that these stones bee made bread .
But he answered , and said , It is written , Man shall not liue by bread alone , but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
Then the deuill taketh him vp into the holy Citie , and setteth him on a pinacle of the Temple ,
And saith vnto him , If thou bee the Sonne of God , cast thy selfe downe : For it is written , He shall giue his Angels charge concerning thee , & in their handes they shall beare thee vp , lest at any time thou dash thy foote against a stone .
Iesus said vnto him , It is written againe , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
Againe the Deuill taketh him vp into an exceeding high mountaine , and sheweth him all the kingdomes of the world , and the glory of them :
And saith vnto him , All these things will I giue thee , if thou wilt fall downe and worship me .
Then saith Iesus vnto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him onely shalt thou serue .
Then the deuill leaueth him , and behold , Angels came and ministred vnto him .
¶ Now when Iesus had heard that Iohn was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee .
And leauing Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is vpon the Sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthali :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet , saying ,
The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthali , by the way of the Sea beyond Iordane , Galilee of the Gentiles :
The people which sate in darkenesse , saw great light : and to them which sate in the region and shadow of death , light is sprung vp .
¶ From that time Iesus began to preach , and to say , Repent , for the kingdome of heauen is at hand .
¶ And Iesus walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon , called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the Sea ( for they were fishers )
And he saith vnto them , Follow mee : and I will make you fishers of men .
And they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
And going on from thence , hee sawe other two brethren , Iames the sonne of Zebedee , and Iohn his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets : and he called them .
And they immediatly left the shippe and their father , and followed him .
¶ And Iesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their Synagogues , and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome , and healing all maner of sickenesse , and all maner of disease among the people .
And his fame went thorowout all Syria : and they brought vnto him all sicke people that were taken with diuerse diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with deuils , and those which were lunaticke , and those that had the palsie , and he healed them .
<NON-VERSE>
And seeing the multitudes , he went vp into a mountaine : and when he was set , his disciples came vnto him .
And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying ,
Blessed are the poore in spirit : for theirs is the kingdome of heauen .
Blessed are they that mourne : for they shall be comforted .
Blessed are the meeke : for they shall inherit the earth .
Blessed are they which doe hunger and thirst after righteousnesse : for they shall be filled .
Blessed are the mercifull : for they shall obtaine mercie .
Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .
Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall bee called the children of God .
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnesse sake : for theirs is the kingdome of heauen .
Blessed are ye , when men shall reuile you , and persecute you , and shal say all manner of euill against you falsly for my sake .
Reioyce , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heauen : For so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you .
¶ Yee are the salt of the earth : But if the salt haue lost his sauour , wherewith shall it bee salted ? It is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be troden vnder foote of men .
Yee are the light of the world . A citie that is set on an hill , cannot be hid .
Neither doe men light a candle , and put it vnder a bushell : but on a candlesticke , and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house .
Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good workes , and glorifie your father which is in heauen .
¶ Thinke not that I am come to destroy the lawe or the Prophets . I am not come to destroy , but to fulfill .
For verily I say vnto you , Till heauen and earth passe , one iote or one title , shall in no wise passe from the law , till all be fulfilled .
Whosoeuer therfore shall breake one of these least commaundements , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdome of heauen : but whosoeuer shall doe , and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen .
For I say vnto you , That except your righteousnesse shall exceede the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees , yee shall in no case enter into the kingdome of heauen .
¶ Yee haue heard , that it was saide by them of old time , Thou shalt not kill : and , Whosoeuer shall kill , shalbe in danger of the iudgement .
But I say vnto you , that whosoeuer is angry with his brother without a cause , shall be in danger of the Iudgement : and whosoeuer shall say to his brother , Racha , shal be in danger of the counsell : but whosoeuer shall say , Thou foole , shalbe in danger of hell fire .
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee :
Leaue there thy gift before the altar , and goe thy way , first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
Agree with thine aduersarie quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him : least at any time the aduersarie deliuer thee to the iudge , and the iudge deliuer thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
Uerily I say vnto thee , thou shalt by no meanes come out thence , till thou hast payd the vttermost farthing .
¶ Yee haue heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not commit adulterie .
But I say vnto you , That whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her , hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart .
And if thy right eie offend thee , plucke it out , and cast it from thee . For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
And if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee . For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
It hath beene said , Whosoeuer shall put away his wife , let him giue her a writing of diuorcement .
But I say vnto you , that whosoeuer shall put away his wife , sauing for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoeuer shall marie her that is diuorced , committeth adulterie .
¶ Againe , yee haue heard that it hath beene said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe , but shalt performe vnto the Lord thine othes .
But I say vnto you , Sweare not at all , neither by heauen , for it is Gods throne :
Nor by the earth , for it is his footstoole : neither by Hierusalem , for it is the citie of the great king .
Neither shalt thou sweare by thy head , because thou canst not make one haire white or blacke .
But let your communication bee Yea , yea : Nay , nay : For whatsoeuer is more then these , commeth of euill .
¶ Yee haue heard that it hath beene said , An eie for an eie , and a tooth for a tooth .
But I say vnto you , that yee resist not euill : but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke , turne to him the other also .
And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coate , let him haue thy cloake also .
And whosoeuer shall compell thee to goe a mile , goe with him twaine .
Giue to him that asketh thee : and from him that would borrow of thee , turne not thou away .
¶ Yee haue heard , that it hath beene said , Thou shalt loue thy neighbour , and hate thine enemie :
But I say vnto you , Loue your enemies , blesse them that curse you , doe good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully vse you , and persecute you :
That yee may be the children of your father which is in heauen : for he maketh his sunne to rise on the euill and on the good , and sendeth raine on the iust , and on the vniust .
For if yee loue them which loue you , what reward haue yee ? Doe not euen the Publicanes the same ?
And if yee salute your brethren only , what do you more then others ? Doe not euen the Publicanes so ?
<NON-VERSE>
Take heed that yee doe not your almes before men , to bee seene of them : otherwise yee haue no reward of your father which is in heauen .
Therefore , when thou doest thine almes , doe not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites doe , in the Synagogues , and in the streetes , that they may haue glory of men . Uerily , I say vnto you , they haue their reward .
But when thou doest almes , let not thy left hand know , what thy right doeth :
That thine almes may be in secret : And thy father which seeth in secret , himselfe shall reward thee openly .
¶ And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they loue to pray standing in the Synagogues , and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seene of men . Uerily I say vnto you , they haue their reward .
But thou when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy doore , pray to thy father which is in secret , and thy father which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
But when yee pray , vse not vaine repetitions , as the heathen doe . For they thinke that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
Be not yee therefore like vnto them : For your father knoweth what things yee haue neede of , before yee aske him .
After this maner therefore pray yee : Our father which art in heauen , hallowed be thy name .
Thy kingdome come . Thy will be done , in earth , as it is in heauen .
Giue vs this day our daily bread .
And forgiue vs our debts , as we forgiue our debters .
And lead vs not into temptation , but deliuer vs from euill : For thine is the kingdome , and the power , and the glory , for euer , Amen .
For , if yee forgiue men their trespasses , your heauenly father will also forgiue you .
But , if yee forgiue not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgiue your trespasses .
¶ Moreouer , when yee fast , be not as the Hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appeare vnto men to fast : Uerily I say vnto you , they haue their reward .
But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face :
That thou appeare not vnto men to fast , but vnto thy father which is in secret : and thy father which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
¶ Lay not vp for your selues treasures vpon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where theeues breake thorow , and steale .
But lay vp for your selues treasures in heauen , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , & where theeues doe not breake thorow , nor steale .
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
The light of the body is the eye : If therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shalbe full of light .
But if thine eye be euill , thy whole body shall be full of darknesse . If therfore the light that is in thee be darkenesse , how great is that darkenesse ?
¶ No man can serue two masters : for either he will hate the one and loue the other , or else hee will holde to the one , and despise the other . Ye cannot serue God and Mammon .
Therfore I say vnto you , Take no thought for your life , what yee shall eate , or what ye shall drinke , nor yet for your body , what yee shall put on : Is not the life more then meate ? and the body then raiment ?
Behold the foules of the aire : for they sow not , neither do they reape , nor gather into barnes , yet your heauenly father feedeth them . Are yee not much better then they ?
Which of you by taking thought , can adde one cubite vnto his stature ?
And why take ye thought for raiment ? Consider the lillies of the field , how they grow : they toile not , neither doe they spinne .
And yet I say vnto you , that euen Solomon in all his glory , was not arayed like one of these .
Wherefore , if God so clothe the grasse of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the ouen : shall he not much more clothe you , O yee of little faith ?
Therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eate ? or , what shall we drinke ? or wherewithall shall wee be clothed ?
( For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke : ) for your heauenly father knoweth that ye haue neede of all these things .
But seeke ye first the kingdome of God , and his righteousnesse , and all these things shalbe added vnto you .
<NON-VERSE>
Iudge not , that ye be not iudged .
For with what iudgment ye iudge , yee shall be iudged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you againe .
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye , but considerest not the beame that is in thine owne eye ?
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let mee pull out the mote out of thine eye , and beholde , a beame is in thine owne eye ?
Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beame out of thine owne eye : and then shalt thou see clearely to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye .
¶ Giue not that which is holy vnto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearles before swine : lest they trample them vnder their feete , and turne againe and rent you .
¶ Aske , and it shalbe giuen you : seeke , and ye shall finde : knocke , and it shalbe opened vnto you .
For euery one that asketh , receiueth : and he that seeketh , findeth : and to him that knocketh , it shalbe opened . Or what man is there of you , whom if his sonne aske bread , will hee giue him a stone ?
Or if he aske a fish , will hee giue him a serpent ?
If ye then being euill , know how to giue good giftes vnto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heauen , giue good things to them that aske him ?
Therefore all things whatsoeuer ye would that men should doe to you , doe ye euen so to them : for this is the Law and the Prophets .
¶ Enter ye in at the strait gate , for wide is the gate , and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which goe in thereat :
Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way which leadeth vnto life , and few there be that finde it .
¶ Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheepes clothing , but inwardly they are rauening wolues .
Yee shall knowe them by their fruits : Doe men gather grapes of thornes , or figges of thistles ?
Euen so , euery good tree bringeth forth good fruit : but a corrupt tree bringeth forth euill fruit .
A good tree cannot bring forth euil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit , is hewen downe , and cast into the fire .
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
¶ Not euery one that saith vnto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdome of heauen : but he that doth the will of my father which is in heauen .
Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , haue we not prophecied in thy name ? and in thy name haue cast out deuils ? and in thy name done many wonderfull works ?
And then wil I professe vnto them , I neuer knew you : Depart from me , ye that worke iniquity .
¶ Therefore , whosoeuer heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I wil liken him vnto a wise man , which built his house vpon a rocke :
And the raine descended , and the floods came , and the windes blew , and beat vpon that house : and it fell not , for it was founded vpon a rocke .
And euery one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall bee likened vnto a foolish man , which built his house vpon the sand :
And the raine descended , and the floods came , and the windes blew , and beat vpon that house , and it fell , and great was the fall of it .
And it came to passe , when Iesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine .
<NON-VERSE>
When he was come downe from the Mountaine , great multitudes folowed him .
And behold , there came a leper , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , If thou wilt , thou canst make me cleane .
And Iesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will , bee thou cleane . And immediately his leprosie was cleansed .
And Iesus saith vnto him , See thou tell no man , but go thy way , shew thy selfe to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimonie vnto them .
¶ And when Iesus was entred into Capernaum , there came vnto him a Centurion , beseeching him ,
And saying , Lord , my seruant lieth at home sicke of the palsie , grieuously tormented .
And Iesus saith vnto him , I will come , and heale him .
The Centurion answered , and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe : but speake the word onely , and my seruant shalbe healed .
For I am a man vnder authority , hauing souldiers vnder me : and I say to this man , Goe , and he goeth : and to another , Come , and he commeth : and to my seruant , Doe this , and he doth it .
When Iesus heard it , he marueiled , and said to them that followed , Uerely , I say vnto you , I haue not found so great faith , no not in Israel .
And I say vnto you , that many shall come from the East and West , and shal sit downe with Abraham , and Isaac , & Iacob , in the kingdome of heauen :
But the children of the kingdome shall be cast out into outer darkenesse : there shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth .
And Iesus said vnto the Centurion , Go thy way , and as thou hast beleeued , so be it done vnto thee . And his seruant was healed in the self same houre .
¶ And when Iesus was come into Peters house , hee saw his wiues mother laid , and sicke of a feuer :
And he touched her hand , and the feuer left her : and she arose , and ministred vnto them .
¶ When the Euen was come , they brought vnto him many that were possessed with deuils : and hee cast out the spirits with his worde , and healed all that were sicke ,
That it might be fulfilled which which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet , saying , Himselfe tooke our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses .
¶ Now when Iesus saw great multitudes about him , hee gaue commaundement to depart vnto the other side .
And a certaine Scribe came , and said vnto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoeuer thou goest .
And Iesus saith vnto him , The Foxes haue holes , and the birds of the ayre haue nests : but the sonne of man hath not where to lay his head .
And another of his Disciples said vnto him , Lord , suffer me first to goe , and bury my father .
But Iesus said vnto him , Follow me , & let the dead , bury their dead .
¶ And when he was entred into a ship , his Disciples followed him .
And behold , there arose a great tempest in the Sea , insomuch that the ship was couered with the waues : but he was asleepe .
And his Disciples came to him , and awoke , saying , Lord , saue vs : we perish .
And he saith vnto them , Why are yee fearefull , O yee of litle faith ? Then hee arose , and rebuked the winds and the Sea , and there was a great calme .
But the men marueiled , saying , What maner of man is this , that euen the winds and the Sea obey him ?
¶ And when hee was come to the other side , into the countrey of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with deuils , comming out of the tombes , exceeding fierce , so that no man might passe by that way .
And behold , they cryed out , saying , What haue we to doe with thee , Iesus thou sonne of God ? Art thou come hither to torment vs befor the time ?
And there was a good way off from them , an heard of many swine , feeding .
So the deuils besought him , saying , If thou cast vs out , suffer vs to goe away into the herd of swine .
And he said vnto them , Goe . And when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and behold , the whole herd of swine ranne violently downe a steepe place into the Sea , and perished in the waters .
And they that kept them , fled , and went their waies into the citie , and told euery thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the deuils .
<NON-VERSE>
And hee entred into a ship , and passed ouer , and came into his owne citie .
And behold , they brought to him a man sicke of the palsie , lying on a bed : and Iesus seeing their faith , said vnto the sicke of the palsie , Sonne , be of good cheere , thy sinnes be forgiuen thee .
And behold , certaine of the Scribes said within themselues , This man blasphemeth .
And Iesus knowing their thoughts , said , Wherefore thinke yee euill in your hearts ?
For whether is easier to say , Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee : or to say , Arise , and walke ?
But that yee may know that the sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue sinnes , ( Then saith hee to the sicke of the palsie ) Arise , take vp thy bed , and goe vnto thine house .
And he arose , and departed to his house .
But when the multitudes saw it , they marueiled , & glorified God , which had giuen such power vnto men .
¶ And as Iesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man named Matthew , sitting at the receite of custome : and he saith vnto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him .
¶ And it came to passe , as Iesus sate at meate in the house , behold , many publicanes and sinners , came and sate downe with him and his Disciples .
And when the Pharisees saw it , they said vnto his disciples , Why eateth your master with publicanes & sinners .
But when Iesus heard that , hee said vnto them , They that be whole neede not a Physicion , but they that are sicke .
But goe ye and learne what that meaneth , I will haue mercy and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
¶ Then came to him the disciples of Iohn , saying , Why doe we and the Pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
And Iesus saide vnto them , Can the children of the bride - chamber mourne , as long as the bridegrome is with them ? But the dayes will come when the bridegrome shall bee taken from them , and then shall they fast .
No man putteth a piece of new cloth vnto an olde garment : for that which is put in to fill it vp , taketh from the garment , & the rent is made worse .
Neither doe men put new wine into old bottels : else the bottels breake , and the wine runneth out , and the bottels perish : but they put new wine into new bottels , and both are preserued .
¶ While hee spake these things vnto them , beholde , there came a certaine ruler and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is euen now dead : but come , and lay thy hand vpon her , and she shall liue .
And Iesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
( ¶ And behold , a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue yeeres , came behinde him , and touched the hemme of his garment .
For she said within her selfe , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
But Iesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , bee of good comfort , thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that houre . )
And when Iesus came into the rulers house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
He said vnto them , Giue place , for the mayd is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorne .
But when the people were put foorth , he went in , and tooke her by the hand : and the mayd arose .
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
¶ And when Iesus departed thence , two blinde men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou sonne of Dauid , haue mercy on vs .
And when he was come into the house , the blinde men came to him : and Iesus saith vnto them , Beleeue ye that I am able to doe this ? They said vnto him , Yea , Lord .
Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith , bee it vnto you .
And their eyes were opened : and Iesus straitly charged them , saying , See that no man know it .
But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that countrey .
¶ As they went out , beholde , they brought to him a dumbe man possessed with a deuill .
And when the deuil was cast out , the dumbe spake , and the multitudes marueiled , saying , It was neuer so seene in Israel .
But the Pharisees said , He casteth out the deuils through the prince of the deuils .
And Iesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their Synagogues , and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome , and healing euery sickenesse , and euery disease among the people .
¶ But when he saw the multitudes , he was moued with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheepe hauing no shepheard .
Then saith he vnto his disciples , The haruest truely is plenteous , but the labourers are few .
<NON-VERSE>
And when hee had called vnto him his twelue disciples , he gaue them power against vncleane spirits , to cast them out , and to heale all maner of sickenesse , and all maner of disease .
Now the names of the twelue Apostles are these : The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother , Iames the sonne of Zebedee , and Iohn his brother :
Philip , and Bartholomew , Thomas , and Matthew the Publicane , Iames the sonne of Alpheus , and Lebbeus , whose surname was Thaddeus :
Simon the Canaanite , and Iudas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
These twelue Iesus sent foorth , and commanded them , saying , Goe not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
But goe rather to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel .
And as yee goe , preach , saying , The kingdome of heauen is at hand :
Heale the sicke , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out deuils : freely ye haue receiued , freely giue .
Prouide neither gold , nor siluer , nor brasse in your purses :
Nor scrippe for your iourney , neither two coats , neither shooes , nor yet staues : ( for the workeman is worthy of his meat . )
And into whatsoeuer city or towne ye shall enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and there abide till yee goe thence .
And when ye come into an house , salute it .
And if the house be worthy , let your peace come vpon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace returne to you .
And whosoeuer shall not receiue you , nor heare your words : when yee depart out of that house , or city , shake off the dust of your feete .
Uerely I say vnto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of iudgment , then for that citie .
¶ Behold , I send you foorth as sheepe in the middest of wolues : be yee therefore wise as serpents , and harmelesse as doues .
But beware of men : for they will deliuer you vp to the Councils , and they will scourge you in their Synagogues ,
And yee shall be brought before Gouernours and Kings for my sake , for a testimonie against them , and the Gentiles .
But when they deliuer you vp , take no thought , how or what ye shall speake , for it shall bee giuen you in that same houre what ye shall speake .
For it is not yee that speake , but the Spirit of your Father , which speaketh in you .
And the brother shall deliuer vp the brother to death , and the father the childe : and the children shall rise vp against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
And yee shall be hated of all men for my Names sake : but he that endureth to the end , shalbe saued .
But when they persecute you in this citie , flee ye into another : for verely I say vnto you , ye shall not haue gone ouer the cities of Israel , till the Sonne of man be come .
The disciple is not aboue his master , nor the seruant aboue his lord .
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the seruant as his Lord : If they haue called the Master of the house of Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
Feare them not therefore : for there is nothing couered , that shall not be reueiled ; and hidde , that shall not be knowen .
What I tell you in darkenesse , that speake yee in light : and what yee heare in the eare , that preach yee vpon the house tops .
And feare not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soule : but rather feare him which is able to destroy both soule and body in hell .
Are not two Sparrowes solde for a farthing ? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
But the very haires of your head are all numbred .
Feare yee not therefore , ye are of more value then many Sparrowes .
Whosoeuer therefore shall confesse mee before men , him will I confesse also before my Father which is in heauen .
But whosoeuer shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heauen .
Thinke not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , & the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
And a mans foes shalbe they of his owne houshold .
He that loueth father or mother more then me , is not worthy of me : and he that loueth sonne or daughter more then me , is not worthy of me .
And he that taketh not his crosse , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
He that findeth his life , shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake , shall find it .
¶ He that receiueth you , receiueth me : and he that receiueth mee , receiueth him that sent me .
He that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet , shall receiue a Prophets reward : and he that receiueth a righteous man , in the name of a righteous man , shal receiue a righteous mans reward .

And it came to passe , when Iesus had made an end of commaunding his twelue Disciples , hee departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
Now when Iohn had heard in the prison the workes of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
And said vnto him , Art thou hee that should come ? Or doe wee looke for another ?
Iesus answered and saide vnto them , Go and shew Iohn againe those things which we doe heare and see :
The blind receiue their sight , and the lame walke , the lepers are cleansed , and the deafe heare , the dead are raised vp , and the poore haue the Gospel preached to them .
And blessed is he , whoseouer shal not be offended in me .
¶ And as they departed , Iesus began to say vnto the multitudes concerning Iohn , what went ye out into the wildernesse to see ? a reede shaken with the winde ?
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they that weare soft cloathing , are in kings houses .
But what went ye out for to see ? A Prophet ? yea , I say vnto you , and more then a Prophet .
For this is he of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
Uerely I say vnto you , Among them that are borne of women , there hath not risen a greater then Iohn the Baptist : notwithstanding , hee that is least in the kingdome of heauen , is greater then he .
And from the dayes of Iohn the Baptist , vntill now , the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
For all the Prophets , and the Law prophecied vntill Iohn .
And if ye wil receiue it , this is Elias which was for to come .
Hee that hath eares to heare , let him heare .
¶ But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like vnto children , sitting in the markets , and calling vnto their fellowes ,
And saying , we haue piped vnto you , and ye haue not danced : wee haue mourned vnto you , and ye haue not lamented .
For Iohn came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , he hath a deuill .
The sonne of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a wine bibber , a friend of publicanes and sinners : but wisedom is iustified of her children .
¶ Then began he to vpbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not .
Woe vnto thee Chorazin , woe vnto thee Bethsaida : for if the mightie workes which were done in you , had bene done in Tyre and Sidon , they would haue repented long agoe in sackcloth and ashes .
But I say vnto you , It shall bee more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of iudgement , then for you .
And thou Capernaum , which art exalted vnto heauen , shalt be brought downe to hell : For if the mighty works which haue beene done in thee , had bin done in Sodome , it would haue remained vntil this day .
But I say vnto you , that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , in the day of iudgment , then for thee .
¶ At that time Iesus answered , and said , I thanke thee , O Father , Lord of heauen and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise & prudent , & hast reueiled them vnto babes .
Euen so , Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight .
All things are deliuered vnto me of my father : and no man knoweth the sonne but the father : neither knoweth any man the father , saue the sonne , and hee to whomsoeuer the sonne will reueile him .
¶ Come vnto me all yee that labour , and are heauy laden , and I will giue you rest .
Take my yoke vpon you , and learne of me , for I am meeke and lowly in heart : and yee shall find rest vnto your soules .

At that time , Iesus went on the Sabbath day thorow the corne , & his Disciples were an hungred , and beganne to pluck the eares of corne , and to eate .
But when the Pharises saw it , they said vnto him , Behold , thy Disciples doe that which is not lawfull to doe vpon the Sabbath day .
But he said vnto them , Haue yee not read what Dauid did when hee was an hungred , and they that were with him ,
How he entred into the house of God , and did eate the shew bread , which was not lawfull for him to eate , neither for them which were with him , but , only for the Priests ?
Or haue yee not read in the law , how that on the Sabbath dayes the Priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath , and are blamelesse ?
But I saye vnto you , that in this place is one greater then the Temple .
But if yee had knowen what this meaneth , I will haue mercy , and not sacrifice , yee would not haue condemned the guiltlesse .
For the sonne of man is Lord euen of the Sabbath day .
And when hee was departed thence , he went into their Synagogue .
¶ And behold , there was a man which had his hand withered , and they asked him , saying , Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath dayes ? that they might accuse him .
And hee said vnto them , What man shal there be among you , that shall haue one sheepe : and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day , will hee not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
How much then is a man better then a shepe ? Wherfore it is lawfull to doe well on the Sabbath dayes .
Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand : and hee stretched it forth , and it was restored whole , like as the other .
¶ Then the Pharises went out , and held a counsell against him , how they might destroy him .
But when Iesus knew it , hee withdrew himselfe from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ,
And charged them that they should not make him knowen :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet , saying ,
Behold , my seruant whom I haue chosen , my beloued in whom my soule is well pleased : I will put my spirit vpon him , and he shall shew iudgement to the Gentiles .
He shall not striue , nor cry , neither shall any man heare his voice in the streets .
A bruised reed shal he not breake , and smoking flaxe shall he not quench , till he send forth iudgment vnto victory .
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust .
¶ Then was brought vnto him one possessed with a deuill , blinde , and dumbe : and hee healed him , insomuch that the blinde and dumbe both spake and saw .
And all the people were amazed , and said , Is this the sonne of Dauid ?
But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doeth not cast out deuils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the deuils .
And Iesus knew their thoughts , and said vnto them , Euery kingdome diuided against it selfe , is brought to desolation : and euery citie or house diuided against it selfe , shall not stand .
And if Satan cast out Satan , he is diuided against himselfe ; how shall then his kingdome stand ?
And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils , by whom doe your children cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your Iudges .
But if I cast out deuils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdome of God is come vnto you .
Or else , how can one enter into a strong mans house , & spoile his goods , except hee first binde the strong man , and then he will spoile his house .
He that is not with me , is against me : and hee that gathereth not with me , scattereth abroad .
¶ Wherefore I say vnto you , All maner of sinne and blasphemie shall be forgiuen vnto men : but the blasphemie against the holy Ghost , shall not bee forgiuen vnto men .
And whosoeuer speaketh a word against the sonne of man , it shall be forgiuen him : but whosoeuer speaketh against the holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiuen him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
Either make the tree good , and his fruit good : Or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : For the tree is knowen by his fruit .
O generation of vipers , how can ye , being euil , speake good things ? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
A good man out of the good treasure of the heart , bringeth foorth good things : and an euill man out of the euill treasure , bringeth foorth euill things .
But I say vnto you , That euery idle word that men shall speake , they shall giue accompt thereof in the day of Iudgement .
For by thy wordes thou shalt bee iustified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
¶ Then certaine of the Scribes , and of the Pharisees , answered , saying , Master , we would see a signe from thee .
But hee answered , and said to them , An euill and adulterous generation seeketh after a signe , and there shall no signe be giuen to it , but the signe of the Prophet Ionas .
For as Ionas was three dayes and three nights in the whales belly : so shal the sonne of man be three daies and three nights in the heart of the earth .
The men of Nineue shall rise in iudgement with this generation , and shall condemne it , because they repented at the preaching of Ionas , and behold , a greater then Ionas is here .
The Queene of the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation , and shall condemne it : for she came from the vttermost parts of the earth to heare the wisedome of Solomon , and behold , a greater then Solomon is here .
When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man , hee walketh thorow dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
Then he saith , I will returne into my house from whence I came out ; And when he is come , he findeth it emptie , swept , and garnished .
Then goeth he , and taketh with himselfe seuen other spirits more wicked then himselfe , and they enter in and dwell there : And the last state of that man is worse then the first . Euen so shal it be also vnto this wicked generation .
¶ While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speake with him .
Then one saide vnto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speake with thee .
But he answered , and said vnto him that told him , Who is my mother ? And who are my brethren ?
And hee stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold , my mother and my brethren .

The same day went Iesus out of the house , and sate by the sea side .
And great multitudes were gathered together vnto him , so that hee went into a ship , and sate , and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
And hee spake many things vnto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went foorth to sow .
And when he sowed , some seedes fell by the wayes side , and the foules came , and deuoured them vp .
Some fell vpon stony places , where they had not much earth : and foorth with they sprung vp , because they had no deepenesse of earth .
And when the Sunne was vp , they were scorched : and because they had not root , they withered away .
And some fell among thorns : and the thornes sprung vp , & choked them .
But other fell into good ground , and brought foorth fruit , some an hundred folde , some sixtie folde , some thirty folde .
Who hath eares to heare , let him heare .
And the disciples came , and sayd vnto him , Why speakest thou vnto them in parables ?
He answered , and said vnto them , Because it is giuen vnto you to know the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen , but to them it is not giuen .
For whosoeuer hath , to him shall be giuen , and he shall haue more abundance : but whosoeuer hath not , from him shall be taken away , euen that hee hath .
Therefore speake I to then in parables : because they seeing , see not : and hearing , they heare not , neither doe they vnderstand .
And in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall heare , and shall not vnderstand : and seeing yee shall see , and shall not perceiue .
For this peoples heart is waxed grosse , and their eares are dull of hearing , and their eyes they haue closed , lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and heare with their eares , and should vnderstand with their heart , and should be conuerted , and I should heale them .
But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your eares , for they heare .
For verely I say vnto you , that many Prophets , and righteous men haue desired to see those things which yee see , and haue not seene them : and to heare those things which ye heare , and haue not heard them .
¶ Heare ye therefore the parable of the sower .
When any one heareth the word of the kingdome , and vnderstandeth it not , then commeth the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sowen in his heart : this is hee which receiued seede by the way side .
But he that receiued the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , & anon with ioy receiueth it :
Yet hath hee not root in himselfe , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
He also that receiued seed among the thorns , is he that heareth the word , and the care of this world , and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the word , and he becommeth vnfruitfull .
But he that receiued seed into the good ground , is hee that heareth the word , and vnderstandeth it , which also beareth fruit , and bringeth foorth , some an hundred fold , some sixtie , some thirty .
¶ Another parable put he forth vnto them , saying ; The kingdome of heauen is likened vnto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
But while men slept , his enemy came & sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
But when the blade was sprung vp , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
So the seruants of the housholder came , and said vnto him , Sir , didst not thou sow good seede in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
He said vnto them , An enemy hath done this . The seruants said vnto him , Wilt thou then that we goe and gather them vp ?
But he said , Nay : lest while yee gather vp the tares , ye root vp also the wheat with them .
Let both grow together vntil the haruest : and in the time of haruest , I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and binde them in bundels to burne them : but gather the wheat into my barne .
¶ Another parable put he foorth vnto them , saying , The kingdome of heauen is like to a graine of mustard seed , which a man tooke , and sowed in his field .
Which indeed is the least of al seeds : but when it is growen , it is the greatest among herbes , and becommeth a tree : so that the birds of the aire come and lodge in the branches thereof .
¶ Another parable spake he vnto them , The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen , which a woman tooke , and hid in three measures of meale , till the whole was leauened .
All these things spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables , and without a parable spake hee not vnto them :
That it might bee fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables , I wil vtter things which haue bin kept secret from the foundation of the world .
Then Iesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came vnto him , saying , Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of the field .
He answered , and said vnto them , Hee that soweth the good seed , is the sonne of man .
The field is the world . The good seed , are the children of the kingdome : but the tares are the children of the wicked one .
The enemie that sowed them , is the deuill . The haruest , is the ende of the world . And the reapers are the Angels .
As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire : so shall it be in the end of this world .
The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdome all things that offend , and them which doe iniquitie :
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wayling and gnashing of teeth .
Then shall the righteous shine foorth as the Sunne , in the kingdome of their father . Who hath eares to heare , let him heare .
¶ Againe , the kingdome of heauen is like vnto treasure hid in a field : the which when a man hath found , hee hideth , and for ioy thereof goeth and selleth all that hee hath , and buyeth that field .
¶ Againe , the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a marchant man , seeking goodly pearles :
Who when hee had found one pearle of great price , he went and solde all that he had , and bought it .
¶ Againe , the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a net that was cast into the sea , and gathered of euery kind ,
Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sate downe , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
So shall it be at the ende of the world : the Angels shal come forth , and seuer the wicked from among the iust ,
And shal cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing , and gnashing of teeth .
Iesus saith vnto them , Haue ye vnderstood all these things ? They say vnto him , Yea , Lord .
Then said he vnto them , Therefore euery Scribe which is instructed vnto the kingdom of heauen , is like vnto a man that is an housholder , which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things new and old .
¶ And it came to passe , that when Iesus had finished these parables , hee departed thence .
And when hee was come into his owne countrey , he taught them in their Synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisedome , and these mighty works ?
Is not this the Carpenters sonne ? Is not his mother called Marie ? and his brethren , Iames , and Ioses , and Simon , and Iudas ?
And his sisters , are they not all with vs ? whence then hath this man all these things ?
And they were offended in him . But Iesus said vnto them , A Prophet is not without honour , saue in his owne countrey , and in his owne house .
<NON-VERSE>
At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Iesus ,
And said vnto his seruants , This is Iohn the Baptist , hee is risen from the dead , and therfore mighty workes doe shew foorth themselues in him .
¶ For Herode had layd hold on Iohn , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias sake , his brother Philips wife .
For Iohn said vnto him , It is not lawfull for thee to haue her .
And when he would haue put him to death , hee feared the multitude , because they counted him as a Prophet .
But when Herods birth day was kept , the daughter of Herodias daunced before them , and pleased Herode .
Whereupon he promised with an oath , to giue her whatsoeuer she would aske .
And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , Giue me heere Iohn Baptists head in a charger .
And the king was sorie : neuerthelesse for the othes sake , and them which sate with him at meate , he commanded it to be giuen her :
And he sent , and beheaded Iohn in the prison .
And his head was brought in a charger , and giuen to the Damsell : and she brought it to her mother .
And his Disciples came , and took vp the body , and buried it , and went and told Iesus .
¶ When Iesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship , into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foote , out of the cities .
And Iesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was mooued with compassion toward them , and he healed their sicke .
¶ And when it was euening , his Disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may goe into the villages , and buy themselues victuals .
But Iesus said vnto them , They neede not depart ; giue yee them to eate .
And they say vnto him , We haue heere but fiue loaues , and two fishes .
He said , Bring them hither to me .
And hee commanded the multitude to sit downe on the grasse , & tooke the fiue loaues , and the two fishes , and looking vp to heauen , hee blessed , and brake , and gaue the loaues to his Disciples , and the Disciples to the multitude .
And they did all eat , & were filled : and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained twelue baskets full .
And they that had eaten , were about fiue thousand men , beside women and children .
¶ And straightway Iesus constrained his Disciples to get into a ship , and to goe before him vnto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
And when he had sent the multitudes away , he went vp into a mountaine apart to pray : and when the euening was come , he was there alone :
But the ship was now in the midst of the Sea , tossed with waues : for the wind was contrary .
And in the fourth watch of the night , Iesus went vnto them , walking on the Sea .
And when the Disciples saw him walking on the Sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit : and they cried out for feare .
But straightway Iesus spake vnto them , saying , Be of good cheere : it is I , be not afraid .
And Peter answered him , and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come vnto thee on the water .
And he said , Come . And when Peter was come downe out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Iesus .
But when he saw the wind boysterous , he was afraid : and beginning to sinke , he cried , saying , Lord saue me .
And immediately Iesus stretched foorth his hand , and caught him , and said vnto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
Then they that were in the ship , came and worshipped him , saying , Of a trueth thou art the sonne of God .
¶ And when they were gone ouer , they came into the land of Genesaret .
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that countrey round about , and brought vnto him al that were diseased ,
<NON-VERSE>
Then came to Iesus Scribes and Pharisees , which were of Hierusalem , saying ,
Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders ? for they wash not their handes when they eat bread .
But hee answered , and said vnto them , Why doe you also transgresse the Commandement of God by your tradition ?
For God commaunded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : And hee that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
But yee say , Whosoeuer shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift by whatsoeuer thou mightest bee profited by me ,
And honour not his father or his mother , hee shall be free . Thus haue yee made the Commaundement of God of none effect by your tradition .
Yee hypocrites , well did Esaias prophecie of you , saying ,
This people draweth nigh vnto mee with their mouth , and honoureth mee with their lips : but their heart is farre from me .
But in vaine they do worship me , teaching for doctrines , the commandements of men .
¶ And he called the multitude , and said vnto them , Heare and vnderstand .
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man : but that which commeth out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
Then came his disciples , and said vnto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying ?
But he answered and said , Euery plant which my heauenly father hath not planted , shalbe rooted vp .
Let them alone : they be blinde leaders of the blinde . And if the blinde lead the blinde , both shall fall into the ditch .
Then answered Peter , and said vnto him , Declare vnto vs this parable .
And Iesus said , Are yee also yet without vnderstanding ?
Doe not yee yet vnderstand , that whatsoeuer entreth in at the mouth , goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
But those things which proceed out of the mouth , come forth from the heart , and they defile the man .
For out of the heart proceed euill thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witnes , blasphemies .
These are the things which defile a man : But to eate with vnwashen hands , defileth not a man .
¶ Then Iesus went thence , and departed into the coastes of Tyre and Sidon .
And behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts , & cried vnto him , saying , Haue mercy on me , O Lord , thou sonne of Dauid , my daughter is grieuously vexed with a deuill .
But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came , and besought him , saying , Send her away , for she cryeth after vs .
But he answered , and said , I am not sent , but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel .
Then came she , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , helpe me .
But he answered , and said , It is not meete to take the childrens bread , and to cast it to dogs .
And she said , Trueth Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crummes which fall from their masters table .
Then Iesus answered , and said vnto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it vnto thee euen as thou wilt . And her daughter was made whole from that very houre .
And Iesus departed from thence , and came nigh vnto the sea of Galile , and went vp into a mountaine , and sate downe there .
And great multitudes came vnto him , hauing with them those that were lame , blinde , dumbe , maimed , and many others , and cast them downe at Iesus feet , and he healed them :
Insomuch that the multitude wondred , when they saw the dumbe to speake , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walke , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
¶ Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him , and said , I haue compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three dayes , and haue nothing to eate : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
And his disciples say vnto him , Whence should we haue so much bread in the wildernesse , as to fill so great a multitude ?
And Iesus saith vnto them , How many loaues haue yee ? And they said , Seuen , and a few little fishes .
And hee commaunded the multitude to sit downe on the ground .
And he tooke the seuen loaues and the fishes , and gaue thankes , and brake them , and gaue to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
And they did all eate , and were filled : and they tooke vp of the broken meate that was left , seuen baskets full .
And they that did eat , were foure thousand men , beside women and children .
<NON-VERSE>
The Pharises also , with the Sadduces , came , and tempting , desired him that hee would shew them a signe from heauen .
He answered , and said vnto them , When it is euening , yee say , It will bee faire weather : for the skie is red .
And in the morning , It will be foule weather to day : for the skie is red and lowring . O ye hypocrites , yee can discerne the face of the skie , but can ye not discerne the signes of the times ?
A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a signe , and there shall no signe be giuen vnto it , but the signe of the Prophet Ionas . And hee left them , and departed .
And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
¶ Then Iesus said vnto them , Take heed and beware of the leauen of the Pharises , and of the Sadduces .
And they reasoned among themselues , saying , It is because we haue taken no bread .
Which when Iesus perceiued , he said vnto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among your selues , because ye haue brought no bread ?
Doe ye not yet vnderstand , neither remember the fiue loaues of the fiue thousand , and how many baskets ye tooke vp ?
Neither the seuen loaues of the foure thousand , and how many baskets ye tooke vp ?
How is it that ye doe not vnderstand , that I spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leauen of the Pharises , and of the Sadduces ?
Then vnderstood they how that he bade them not beware of the leauen of bread : but of the doctrine of the Pharisees , and of the Sadduces .
¶ When Iesus came into the coasts of Cesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom doe men say , that I , the sonne of man , am ?
And they said , Some say that thou art Iohn the Baptist , some Elias , and others Ieremias , or one of the Prophets .
He saith vnto them , But whom say ye that I am ?
And Simon Peter answered , and said , Thou art Christ the sonne of the liuing God .
And Iesus answered , and said vnto him , Blessed art thou Simon Bar Iona : for flesh and blood hath not reueiled it vnto thee , but my Father which is in heauen .
And I say also vnto thee , that thou art Peter , and vpon this rocke I will build my Church : and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it .
And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen : and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind on earth , shall be bound in heauen : whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth , shall be loosed in heauen .
Then charged hee his disciples that they should tel no man that he was Iesus the Christ .
¶ From that time foorth began Iesus to shew vnto his disciples , how that he must goe vnto Hierusalem , and suffer many things of the Elders and chiefe Priests & Scribes , and be killed , and be raised againe the third day .
Then Peter tooke him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it farre from thee Lord : This shal not be vnto thee .
But he turned , and said vnto Peter , Get thee behind mee , Satan , thou art an offence vnto me : for thou sauourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
¶ Then said Iesus vnto his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him denie himselfe , and take vp his crosse , and follow me .
For whosoeuer will saue his life , shall lose it : and whosoeuer will lose his his life for my sake , shall finde it .
For what is a man profited , if hee shal gaine the whole world , and lose his owne soule ? Or what shall a man giue in exchange for his soule ?
For the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father , with his Angels : and then he shall reward euery man according to his works .

And after sixe dayes , Iesus taketh Peter , Iames , and Iohn his brother , and bringeth them vp into an high mountaine apart ,
And was transfigured before them , and his face did shine as the Sunne , and his raiment was white as the light .
And behold , there appeared vnto them Moses , and Elias , talking with him .
Then answered Peter , and saide vnto Iesus , Lord , it is good for vs to be here : If thou wilt , let vs make here three tabernacles : one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
While he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud ouershadowed them : and behold a voyce out of the cloude , which saide , This is my beloued sonne , in whom I am well pleased : heare ye him .
And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
And Iesus came and touched them , and said , Arise , and be not afraid .
And when they had lift vp their eyes , they saw no man , saue Iesus only .
And as they came downe from the mountaine , Iesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , vntil the sonne of man bee risen againe from the dead .
And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come ?
And Iesus answered , and said vnto them , Elias truely shall first come , and restore all things :
But I say vnto you , that Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they listed : Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
Then the Disciples vnderstood that he spake vnto them of Iohn the Baptist .
¶ And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certaine man , kneeling downe to him , and saying ,
Lord , haue mercie on my sonne , for he is lunatike , and sore vexed : for oft times he falleth into the fire , and oft into the water .
And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
Then Iesus answered , and said , O faithlesse and peruerse generation , how long shall I bee with you ? howe long shal I suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
And Iesus rebuked the deuill , and hee departed out of him : and the childe was cured from that very houre .
Then came the Disciples to Iesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ?
Howbeit , this kind goeth not out , but by prayer and fasting .
¶ And while they abode in Galilee , Iesus said vnto them , The sonne of man shall be betraied into the hands of men :
Hee saith , Yes . And when hee was come into the house , Iesus preuented him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? of whom doe the kings of the earth take custome or tribute ? of their owne children , or of strangers ?
Peter saith vnto him , Of strangers . Iesus saith vnto him , Then are the children free .
<NON-VERSE>
At the same time came the Disciples vnto Iesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the Kingdome of heauen ?
And Iesus called a little child vnto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
And said , Uerily I say vnto you , Except yee be conuerted , and become as little children , yee shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen .
Whosoeuer therefore shall humble himselfe as this little childe , the same is greatest in the Kingdome of heauen .
And who so shall receiue one such little child in my name , receiueth me .
But who so shall offend one of these little ones which beleeue in me , it were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his necke , and that hee were drowned in the depth of the Sea .
¶ Woe vnto the world because of offences : for it must needs be that offences come : but wo to that man by whom the offence commeth .
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foote offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather then hauing two hands or two feete , to be cast into euerlasting fire .
And if thine eie offend thee , plucke it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eie , rather then hauing two eies , to be cast into hell fire . Take heed that yee despise not one of these little ones : for I say vnto you , that in heauen their Angels do alwaies behold the face of my father which is in heauen .
For the sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost . How thinke yee ? if a man haue an hundred sheepe , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leaue the ninetie and nine , and goeth into the mountaines , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
And if so be that he find it , Uerily I say vnto you , hee reioyceth more of that sheepe , then of the ninetie and nine which went not astray .
Euen so , it is not the will of your father which is in heauen , that one of these little ones should perish .
¶ Moreouer , if thy brother shall trespasse against thee , goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone : if he shall heare thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
But if he will not heare thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses , euery word may be established .
And if hee shall neglect to heare them , tell it vnto the Church : But if he neglect to heare the Church , let him be vnto thee as an heathen man , and a Publicane .
Uerily I say vnto you , Whatsoeuer ye shall binde on earth , shall bee bound in heauen : and whatsoeuer yee shall loose on earth , shall bee loosed in heauen .
Againe I say vnto you , that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall aske , it shall bee done for them of my father which is in heauen .
For where two or three are gathered together in my Name , there am I in the midst of them .
¶ Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sinne against mee , and I forgiue him ? till seuen times ?
Iesus saith vnto him , I say not vnto thee , Untill seuen times : but , Untill seuentie times seuen .
¶ Therefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine king , which would take accompt of his seruants .
And when hee had begun to reckon , one was brought vnto him which ought him ten thousand talents .
But forasmuch as hee had not to pay , his lord commanded him to bee sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
The seruant therfore fell downe , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , haue patience with mee , and I will pay thee all .
Then the Lord of that seruant was moued with compassion , and loosed him , and forgaue him the debt .
But the same seruant went out , and found one of his fellow - seruants , which ought him an hundred pence : and hee layd handes on him , and tooke him by the throte , saying , Pay mee that thou owest .
And his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete , and besought him , saying , Haue patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till hee should pay the debt .
So when his fellow - seruants saw what was done , they were very sorie , and came , and told vnto their lord all that was done .
Then his lord , after that hee had called him , said vnto him , O thou wicked seruant , I forgaue thee all that debt because thou desiredst me :
Shouldest not thou also haue had compassion on thy fellow - seruant , euen as I had pitie on thee ?
And his lord was wroth , and deliuered him to the tormentors , till hee should pay all that was due vnto him .

And it came to passe , that when Iesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coastes of Iudea , beyond Iordane :
And great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there .
¶ The Pharisees also came vnto him , tempting him , and saying vnto him , Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife for euery cause ?
And hee answered , and said vnto them , Haue ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning , made them male and female ?
And said , For this cause shall a man leaue father and mother , and shall cleaue to his wife : and they twaine shalbe one flesh .
Wherefore they are no more twaine , but one flesh . What therefore God hath ioyned together , let not man put asunder .
They say vnto him , Why did Moses then command to giue a writing of diuorcement , and to put her away ?
Hee saith vnto them , Moses , because of the hardnesse of your hearts , suffered you to put away your wiues : but from the beginning it was not so .
And I say vnto you , Whosoeuer shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away , doth commit adultery .
¶ His disciples say vnto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marrie .
But hee said vnto them , All men cannot receiue this saying , saue they to whom it is giuen .
For there are some Eunuches , which were so borne from their mothers wombe : and there are some Eunuches , which were made Eunuches of men : and there be Eunuches , which haue made themselues Eunuches for the kingdome of heauens sake . He that is able to receiue it , let him receiue it .
¶ Then were there brought vnto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
But Iesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not to come vnto me : for of such is the kingdome of heauen .
And he laide his hands on them , and departed thence .
¶ And behold , one came and said vnto him , Good master , what good thing shall I do , that I may haue eternall life ?
And he said vnto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandements .
He saith vnto him , Which ? Iesus said , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steale , Thou shalt not beare false witnesse ,
Honour thy father and thy mother : and , Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe .
The young man saith vnto him , All these things haue I kept from my youth vp : what lacke I yet ?
Iesus said vnto him , If thou wilt be perfect , goe and sell that thou hast , and giue to the poore , and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen : and come and follow me .
But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowfull : for he had great possessions .
¶ Then said Iesus vnto his disciples , Uerely I say vnto you , that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen .
And againe I say vnto you , It is easier for a camel to goe thorow the eye of a needle , then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God .
When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , Who then can be saued ?
But Iesus beheld them , and said vnto them , With men this is vnpossible , but with God al things are possible .
¶ Then answered Peter , and said vnto him , Behold , we haue forsaken all , and followed thee , what shall we haue therefore ?
And Iesus said vnto them , Uerily I say vnto you , that ye which haue followed me , in the regeneration when the Sonne of man shal sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shal sit vpon twelue thrones , iudging the twelue tribes of Israel .
And euery one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my Names sake , shall receiue an hundred fold , and shall inherite euerlasting life .

For the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a man that is an housholder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
And when hee had agreed with the labourers for a peny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
And he went out about the third houre , and saw others standing idle in the market place ,
And said vnto them , Go ye also into the vineyard , & whatsoeuer is right , I wil giue you . And they went their way .
Againe he went out about the sixth and ninth houre , and did likewise .
And about the eleuenth houre , he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith vnto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
They say vnto him , Because no man hath hired vs . He saith vnto them , Go ye also into the vineyard : and whatsoeuer is right , that shall ye receiue .
So when euen was come , the lord of the vineyard saith vnto his Steward , Call the labourers , and giue them their hire , beginning from the last , vnto the first .
And when they came that were hired about the eleuenth houre , they receiued euery man a penie .
But when the first came , they supposed that they should haue receiued more , and they likewise receiued euery man a penie .
And when they had receiued it , they murmured against the good man of the house ,
Saying , These last haue wrought but one houre , and thou hast made them equall vnto vs , which haue borne the burden , and heat of the day .
But he answered one of them and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penie ?
Take that thine is , and goe thy way , I will giue vnto this last , euen as vnto thee .
Is it not lawfull for mee to doe what I wil with mine owne ? Is thine eye euill , because I am good ?
So the last shall be first , and the first last : for many bee called , but fewe chosen .
¶ And Iesus going vp to Hierusalem , tooke the twelue disciples apart in the way , and said vnto them ,
Behold , we goe vp to Hierusalem , and the Sonne of man shall be betraied vnto the chiefe Priests , and vnto the Scribes , and they shall condemne him to death ,
And shal deliuer him to the Gentiles to mocke , and to scourge , and to crucifie him : and the third day he shall rise againe .
¶ Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children , with her sonnes , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
And he said vnto her , What wilt thou ? She saith vnto him , Grant , that these my two sonnes may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left in thy kingdome .
But Iesus answered , and said , Ye know not what ye aske . Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of , and to be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with ? They say vnto him , We are able .
And he saith vnto them , Yee shall drinke indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to giue , but it shall be giuen to them for whom it is prepared of my father .
And when the ten heard it , they were moued with indignation against the two brethren .
But Iesus called them vnto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion ouer them , and they that are great , exercise authoritie vpon them . But it shall not be so among you : But whosoeuer will bee great among you , let him be your minister .
And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you , let him be your seruant .
Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto , but minister , and to giue his life a ransome for many .
And as they departed from Hiericho , a great multitude followed him .
¶ And behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Iesus passed by , cried out , saying , Haue mercie on vs , O Lord , thou sonne of Dauid .
And the multitude rebuked them , because they should holde their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Haue mercie on vs , O Lord , thou sonne of Dauid .
And Iesus stood still , and called them , and saide , What will yee that I shall doe vnto you ?
They say vnto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
<NON-VERSE>
And when they drewe nigh vnto Hierusalem , and were come to Bethphage , vnto the mount of Oliues , then sent Iesus two Disciples ,
Saying vnto them , Goe into the village ouer against you , and straightway yee shall find an Asse tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them vnto me .
And if any man say ought vnto you , yee shall say , The Lord hath need of them , and straightway hee will send them .
All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet , saying ,
Tell yee the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy king commeth vnto thee , meeke , and sitting vpon an Asse , and a colt , the foale of an Asse .
And the Disciples went , and did as Iesus commanded them ,
And brought the Asse , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way , others cut downe branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the sonne of Dauid : Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord , Hosanna in the highest .
And when hee was come into Hierusalem , all the citie was mooued , saying , Who is this ?
And the multitude said , This is Iesus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
¶ And Iesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the Temple , and ouerthrew the tables of the money changers , and the seats of them that solde doues ,
And said vnto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer , but yee haue made it a denne of theeues .
And the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple , & he healed them .
And when the chiefe Priests and Scribes saw the wonderfull things that he did , & the children crying in the temple , & saying , Hosanna to the sonne of Dauid , they were sore displeased ,
And said vnto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Iesus saith vnto them , Yea , haue yee neuer read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
¶ And he left them , and went out of the citie into Bethany , and he lodged there .
Now in the morning , as hee returned into the citie , he hungred .
And when he saw a figge tree in the way , hee came to it , and found nothing thereon but leaues only , and said vnto it , Let no fruite growe on thee hence forward for euer . And presently the figge tree withered away .
And when the Disciples saw it , they marueiled , saying , How soone is the figge tree withered away ?
Iesus answered , and said vnto them , Uerily I say vnto you , if yee haue faith , and doubt not , yee shall not onely doe this which is done to the figge tree , but also , if ye shall say vnto this mountaine , Be thou remoued , and be thou cast into the Sea , it shall be done .
And all things whatsoeuer yee shall aske in prayer , beleeuing , ye shall receiue .
¶ And when he was come into the temple , the chiefe Priests and the Elders of the people came vnto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authoritie doest thou these things ? and who gaue thee this authoritie ?
And Iesus answered , and said vnto them , I also will aske you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authoritie I doe these things .
The baptisme of Iohn , whence was it ? from heauen , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselues saying , If we shall say , From heauen , hee will say vnto vs , Why did ye not then beleeue him ?
But if we shall say , Of men , we feare the people , for all hold Iohn as a Prophet .
And they answered Iesus , and said , We cannot tell . And he said vnto them , Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things .
And hee came to the second , and said likewise : and hee answered , and said , I goe sir , and went not .
Whether of them twaine did the will of his father ? They say vnto him , The first . Iesus saith vnto them , Uerely I say vnto you , that the Publicanes and the harlots go into the kingdome of God before you .
For Iohn came vnto you in the way of righteousnesse , and ye beleeued him not : but the Publicanes and the harlots beleeued him . And ye when ye had seene it , repented not afterward , that ye might beleeue him .
¶ Heare another parable . There was a certaine house - holder , which planted a Uineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a wine - presse in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a farre countrey .
And when the time of the fruite drew neere , he sent his seruants to the husbandmen , that they might receiue the fruits of it .
And the husbandmen tooke his seruants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
Againe hee sent other seruants , moe then the first , and they did vnto them likewise .
But last of all , he sent vnto them his sonne , saying , They will reuerence my sonne .
But when the husbandmen saw the sonne , they said among themselues , This is the heire , come , let vs kill him , and let vs sease on his inheritance .
And they caught him , and cast him out of the Uineyard , and slew him .
When the Lord therefore of the Uineyard commeth , what will he doe vnto those husbandmen ?
They say vnto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his Uineyard vnto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
Iesus saith vnto them , Did ye neuer reade in the Scriptures , The stone which the builders reiected , the same is become the head of the corner ? This is the Lords doing , and it is marueilous in our eyes .
Therefore say I vnto you , the kingdome of God shall be taken from you , and giuen to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
And whosoeuer shall fall on this stone , shalbe broken : but on whom soeuer it shall fall , it will grinde him to powder .
And when the chiefe Priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceiued that he spake of them .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iesus answered , and spake vnto them againe by parables , and said ,
The Kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King , which made a marriage for his sonne ,
And sent forth his seruants to call them that were bidden to the wedding , and they would not come .
Againe , hee sent foorth other seruants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Beholde , I haue prepared my dinner ; my oxen , and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come vnto the marriage .
But they made light of it , and went their wayes , one to his farme , another to his merchandize :
And the remnant tooke his seruants , and intreated them spitefully , and slew them .
But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth , and hee sent foorth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burnt vp their citie .
Then saith hee to his seruants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden , were not worthy .
Goe yee therefore into the high wayes , and as many as yee shall finde , bid to the marriage .
So those seruants went out into the high wayes , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good , and the wedding was furnished with ghests .
¶ And when the King came in to see the guests , hee sawe there a man , which had not on a wedding garment ,
And hee sayth vnto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither , not hauing a wedding garment ? And hee was speechlesse .
Then said the king to the seruants , Binde him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkenesse , there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
For many are called , but few are chosen .
¶ Then went the Pharises , and tooke counsell , how they might intangle him in his talke .
And they sent out vnto him their disciples , with the Herodians , saying , Master , wee know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in trueth , neither carest thou for any man ; for thou regardest not the person of men .
Tell vs therefore , what thinkest thou ? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Cesar , or not ?
But Iesus perceiued their wickednesse , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
Shew me the tribute money . And they brought vnto him a peny .
And he sayth vnto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
They say vnto him , Cesars . Then sayth he vnto them , Render therefore vnto Cesar , the things which are Cesars : and vnto God , the things that are Gods .
When they had heard these wordes , they marueiled , and left him , and went their way .
¶ The same day came to him the Sadduces , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , hauing no children , his brother shall marrie his wife , and raise vp seed vnto his brother .
Now there were with vs seuen brethren , and the first when he had maried a wife , deceased , and hauing no issue , left his wife vnto his brother .
Likewise the second also , and the third , vnto the seuenth .
And last of al the woman died also .
Therefore , in the resurrection , whose wife shall she be of the seuen ? for they all had her .
Iesus answered , and said vnto them , Yee doe erre , not knowing the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are giuen in marriage , but are as the Angels of God in heauen .
But as touching the resurrection of the dead , haue ye not read that which was spoken vnto you by God , saying ,
I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Iacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the liuing .
And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
¶ But when the Pharises had heard that he had put the Sadduces to silence , they were gathered together .
Then one of them , which was a Lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
Master , which is the great Commandement in the Law ?
Iesus sayd vnto him , Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soule , and with all thy minde .
This is the first and great Commandement .
And the second is like vnto it , Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe .
On these two Commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets .
¶ While the Pharises were gathered together , Iesus asked them ,
Saying , What thinke yee of Christ ? whose sonne is hee ? They say vnto him , The sonne of Dauid .
He saith vnto them , How then doth Dauid in spirit call him Lord , saying ,
The Lord said vnto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstoole ?
If Dauid then call him Lord , how is he his sonne ?
<NON-VERSE>
Then spake Iesus to the multitude , and to his disciples ,
Saying , The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate :
All therefore whatsoeuer they bid you obserue , that obserue and doe , but doe not ye after their workes : for they say , and doe not .
For they binde heauie burdens , and grieuous to be borne , and lay them on mens shoulders , but they themselues will not mooue them with one of their fingers .
But all their workes they doe , for to be seene of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
And loue the vppermost roomes at feasts , and the chiefe seats in the Synagogues ,
And greetings in the markets , and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi .
But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your Master , euen Christ , and all ye are brethren .
And call no man your father vpon the earth : for one is your father which is in heauen .
Neither be ye called masters : for one is your Master , euen Christ .
But hee that is greatest among you , shall be your seruant .
And whosoeuer shall exalt himselfe , shall be abased : and he that shall humble himselfe , shall be exalted .
¶ But woe vnto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; for yee shut vp the kingdom of heauen against men : For yee neither goe in your selues , neither suffer ye them that are entring , to goe in . Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; for yee deuoure widowes houses , and for a pretence make long prayer ; therefore ye shall receiue the greater damnation .
Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharises , hypocrites ; for yee compasse Sea and land to make one Proselyte , and when hee is made , yee make him two fold more the childe of hell then your selues .
Woe vnto you , yee blind guides , which say , Whosoeuer shall sweare by the Temple , it is nothing : but whosoeuer shal sweare by the gold of the Temple , he is a debter .
Ye fooles and blind : for whether is greater , the gold , or the Temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
And whosoeuer shall sweare by the Altar , it is nothing : but whosoeuer sweareth by the gift that is vpon it , he is guiltie .
Ye fooles and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the Altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
Who so therefore shall sweare by the Altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
And who so shall sweare by the Temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
And he that shall sweare by heauen , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; for yee pay tithe of mint , and annise , and cummine , and haue omitted the weightier matters of the Law , iudgement , mercie and faith : these ought ye to haue done , and not to leaue the other vndone .
Ye blind guides , which straine at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; for yee make cleane the outside of the cup , and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excesse .
Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may bee cleane also .
Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for yee are like vnto whited sepulchres , which indeed appeare beautifull outward , but are within full of dead mens bones , and of all vncleannesse .
Euen so , yee also outwardly appeare righteous vnto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisie and iniquitie .
Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because ye build the tombes of the Prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
And say , If wee had beene in the dayes of our fathers , wee would not haue bene partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets .
Wherefore ye bee witnesses vnto your selues , that yee are the children of them which killed the Prophets .
Fil ye vp then the measure of your fathers .
Yee serpents , yee generation of vipers , How can yee escape the damnation of hell ?
¶ Wherefore behold , I send vnto you Prophets , and wisemen , and Scribes , and some of them yee shall kill and crucifie , and some of them shall yee scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from citie to citie :
That vpon you may come all the righteous blood shed vpon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel , vnto the blood of Zacharias , sonne of Barachias , whom yee slew betweene the temple and the altar .
Uerily I say vnto you , All these things shal come vpon this generation .
O Hierusalem , Hierusalem , thou that killest the Prophets , and stonest them which are sent vnto thee , how often would I haue gathered thy children together , euen as a hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings , and yee would not ?
Behold , your house is left vnto you desolate .
<NON-VERSE>
And Iesus went out , and departed from the temple , and his Disciples came to him , for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
And Iesus said vnto them , See yee not all these things ? Uerily I say vnto you , there shall not be left heere one stone vpon another , that shall not be throwen downe .
¶ And as he sate vpon the mount of Oliues , the Disciples came vnto him priuately , saying , Tell vs , when shall these things be ? And what shall be the signe of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
And Iesus answered , and said vnto them , Take heed that no man deceiue you .
For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ : and shall deceiue many .
And yee shall heare of warres , and rumors of warres : See that yee be not troubled : for all these things must come to passe , but the end is not yet .
For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdome against kingdome , and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes in diuers places .
All these are the beginning of sorrowes .
Then shall they deliuer you vp to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and yee shall bee hated of all nations for my names sake .
And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
And many false Prophets shall rise , and shall deceiue many .
And because iniquitie shal abound , the loue of many shall waxe cold .
But he that shall endure vnto the end , the same shall be saued .
And this Gospell of the kingdome shall be preached in all the world , for a witnesse vnto al nations , and then shall the end come .
When yee therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the Prophet , stand in the holy place , ( who so readeth , let him vnderstand . )
Then let them which be in Iudea , flee into the mountaines .
Let him which is on the house top , not come downe , to take any thing out of his house :
Neither let him which is in the field , returne backe to take his clothes .
And woe vnto them that are with child , and to them that giue sucke in those dayes .
But pray yee that your flight bee not in the winter , neither on the Sabbath day :
For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor euer shall be .
And except those dayes should be shortned , there should no flesh be saued : but for the elects sake , those dayes shall be shortned .
Then if any man shall say vnto you , Loe , heere is Christ , or there : beleeue it not .
For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shal shew great signes and wonders : insomuch that ( if it were possible , ) they shall deceiue the very elect .
Behold , I haue told you before .
Wherefore , if they shall say vnto you , Behold , he is in the desert , goe not foorth : Behold , he is in the secret chambers , beleeue it not .
For as the lightening commeth out of the East , and shineth euen vnto the West : so shall also the coming of the Sonne of man be .
For wheresoeuer the carkeise is , there will the Eagles bee gathered together .
¶ Immediately after the tribulation of those dayes , shall the Sunne be darkned , and the Moone shall not giue her light , and the starres shall fall from heauen , and the powers of the heauens shall be shaken .
And then shall appeare the signe of the Sonne of man in heauen : and then shall all the Tribes of the earth mourne , and they shall see the Sonne of man coming in the clouds of heauen , with power and great glory .
And hee shall send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his Elect from the foure windes , from one end of heauen to the other .
Now learne a parable of the figtree : when his branch is yet tender , and putteth foorth leaues , yee know that Summer is nigh :
So likewise yee , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is neere , euen at the doores .
Uerely I say vnto you , this generation shall not passe , till all these things be fulfilled .
Heauen and earth shall passe away , but my wordes shall not passe away .
¶ But of that day and houre knoweth no man , no , not the Angels of heauen , but my Father onely .
But as the dayes of Noe were , so shall also the comming of the Sonne of man be .
For as in the dayes that were before the Flood , they were eating , and drinking , marrying , and giuing in mariage , vntill the day that Noe entred into the Arke ,
And knew not vntill the Flood came , and tooke them all away : so shall also the comming of the Sonne of man be .
Then shall two be in the field , the one shalbe taken , and the other left .
Two women shall be grinding at the mill : the one shall be taken , and the other left .
¶ Watch therfore , for ye know not what houre your Lord doth come .
But know this , that if the good man of the house had knowen in what watch the thiefe would come , he would haue watched , and would not haue suffered his house to be broken vp .
Therefore be yee also ready : for in such an houre as you thinke not , the sonne of man commeth .
Who then is a faithfull and wise seruant , whom his Lord hath made ruler ouer his houshold , to giue them meat in due season ?
Blessed is that seruant , whome his Lord when he commeth , shall finde so doing .
Uerely I say vnto you , that hee shal make him ruler ouer all his goods .
But and if that euill seruant shal say in his heart , My Lord delayeth his comming ,
And shall begin to smite his fellow seruants , and to eate and drinke with the drunken :
The Lord of that seruant shall come in a day when hee looketh not for him , and in an houre that hee is not ware of :

Then shall the kingdome of heauen be likened vnto ten Uirgins , which tooke their lamps , & went forth to meet the bridegrome .
And fiue of them were wise , and fiue were foolish .
They that were foolish tooke their lampes , and tooke no oyle with them :
But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their lampes .
While the bridegrome taried , they all slumbred and slept .
And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegrome commeth , goe ye out to meet him .
Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lampes .
And the foolish said vnto the wise , Giue vs of your oyle , for our lampes are gone out .
But the wise answered , saying , Not so , lest there be not ynough for vs and you , but goe ye rather to them that sell , and buy for your selues .
And while they went to buy , the bridegrome came , and they that were ready , went in with him to the marriage , and the doore was shut .
Afterward came also the other virgines , saying , Lord , Lord , open to vs .
But he answered , and said , Uerely I say vnto you , I know you not .
Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day , nor the houre , wherein the Sonne of man commeth .
¶ For the kingdome of heauen is as a man trauailing into a farre countrey , who called his owne seruants , and deliuered vnto them his goods :
And vnto one he gaue fiue talents , to another two , and to another one , to euery man according to his seuerall ability , & straightway tooke his iourney .
Then hee that had receiued the fiue talents , went and traded with the same , and made them other fiue talents .
And likewise he that had receiued two , he also gained other two .
But hee that had receiued one , went and digged in the earth , and hid his lordes money .
After a long time , the lord of those seruants commeth , and reckoneth with them .
And so hee that had receiued fiue talents , came and brought other fiue talents , saying , Lord , thou deliueredst vnto me fiue talents , behold , I haue gained besides them , fiue talents moe .
His lord said vnto him , Well done , thou good and faithfull seruant , thou hast been faithfull ouer a few things , I wil make thee ruler ouer many things : enter thou into the ioy of thy lord .
He also that had receiued two talents , came and said , Lord , thou deliueredst vnto me two talents : behold , I haue gained two other talents besides them .
His lord said vnto him , Well done , good and faithfull seruant , thou hast beene faithfull ouer a few things , I wil make thee ruler ouer many things : enter thou into the ioy of thy lord .
Then he which had receiued the one talent , came & said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sowen , & gathering where thou hast not strawed :
And I was afraid , and went and hidde thy talent in the earth : loe , there thou hast that is thine .
His lord answered , and said vnto him , Thou wicked and slouthfull seruant , thou knewest that I reape where I sowed not , and gather where I haue not strawed :
Thou oughtest therefore to haue put my money to the exchangers , and then at my comming I should haue receiued mine owne with vsurie .
Take therefore the talent from him , and giue it vnto him which hath ten talents .
For vnto euery one that hath shall be giuen , and he shall haue abundance : but from him that hath not , shal be taken away , euen that which he hath .
And cast yee the vnprofitable seruant into outer darkenesse , there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
¶ When the Sonne of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy Angels with him , then shall hee sit vpon the throne of his glory :
And before him shall be gathered all nations , and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepheard diuideth his sheepe from the goats .
And he shall set the sheepe on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
Then shall the King say vnto them on his right hand , Come ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
For I was an hungred , and yee gaue me meate : I was thirstie , and ye gaue me drinke : I was a stranger , and ye tooke me in :
Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sicke , and yee visited me : I was in prison , and ye came vnto me .
Then shal the righteous answere him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fedde thee ? or thirstie , and gaue thee drinke ?
When saw wee thee a stranger , and tooke thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
Or when saw we thee sicke , or in prison , and came vnto thee ?
And the King shall answere , and say vnto them , Uerely I say vnto you , in as much as ye haue done it vnto one of the least of these my brethren , ye haue done it vnto me .
Then shall he say also vnto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into euerlasting fire , prepared for the deuill and his angels .
For I was an hungred , and yee gaue me no meat : I was thirstie , and ye gaue me no drinke :
I was a stranger , and yee tooke me not in : naked , and ye clothed mee not : sicke , and in prison , and yee visited me not .
Then shall they also answere him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sicke , or in prison , and did not minister vnto thee ?
Then shall he answere them , saying , Uerely , I say vnto you , in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .

And it came to passe , when Iesus had finished al these sayings , hee said vnto his disciples ,
Ye know that after two dayes is the feast of the Passeouer , and the Sonne of man is betrayed to be crucified .
Then assembled together the chiefe Priests , and the Scribes , and the Elders of the people , vnto the palace of the high Priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
And consulted that they might take Iesus by subtiltie , and kill him .
But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there bee an vproare among the people . ¶ Now when Iesus was in Bethanie , in the house of Simon the leper ,
There came vnto him a woman , hauing an alabaster boxe of very precious ointment , and powred it on his head , as he sate at meat .
But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
For this ointment might haue bin sold for much , and giuen to the poore .
When Iesus vnderstood it , he said vnto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good worke vpon me .
For ye haue the poore alwayes with you , but me ye haue not alwayes .
For in that she hath powred this ointment on my body , shee did it for my buriall .
Uerely I say vnto you , Wheresoeuer this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memoriall of her .
¶ Then one of the twelue , called Iudas Iscariot , went vnto the chiefe Priests ,
And said vnto them , What will ye giue me , and I will deliuer him vnto you ? and they couenanted with him for thirtie pieces of siluer .
And from that time he sought opportunitie to betray him .
¶ Now the first day of the feast of vnleauened bread , the disciples came to Iesus , saying vnto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Passeouer ?
And he said , Goe into the citie to such a man , and say vnto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand , I will keepe the Passeouer at thy house with my disciples .
And the disciples did , as Iesus had appointed them , and they made ready the Passeouer .
Now when the euen was come , he sate downe with the twelue .
And as they did eate , he said , Uerely I say vnto you , that one of you shal betray me .
And they were exceeding sorowfull , and began euery one of them to say vnto him , Lord , Is it I ?
And he answered and said , Hee that dippeth his hand with mee in the dish , the same shall betray me .
The sonne of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe vnto that man by whom the sonne of man is betrayed : It had bin good for that man , if hee had not bene borne .
Then Iudas , which betrayed him , answered , and said , Master , Is it I ? He said vnto him , Thou hast said .
¶ And as they were eating , Iesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gaue it to the Disciples , and said , Take , eate , this is my body .
And he tooke the cup , and gaue thankes , and gaue it to them , saying , Drinke ye all of it :
For this is my blood of the new Testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes .
But I say vnto you , I will not drinke henceforth of this fruite of the vine , vntill that day when I drinke it new with you in my fathers kingdom .
And when they had sung an hymne , they went out into the mount of Oliues .
Then saith Iesus vnto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night , For it is written , I will smite the Shepheard , and the sheepe of the flocke shall be scattered abroad .
But after I am risen againe , I will goe before you into Galilee .
Peter answered , and said vnto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I neuer be offended .
Iesus said vnto him , Uerily I say vnto thee , that this might before the cocke crow , thou shalt denie me thrise .
Peter said vnto him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not denie thee . Likewise also said all the Disciples .
¶ Then commeth Iesus with them vnto a place called Gethsemane , and saith vnto the Disciples , Sit yee heere , while I goe and pray yonder .
And hee tooke with him Peter , and the two sonnes of Zebedee , and beganne to be sorrowful , and very heauie .
Then saith he vnto them , My soule is exceeding sorrowfull , euen vnto death : tary ye heere , & watch with me .
And he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my father , if it be possible , let this cup passe from me : neuerthelesse , not as I will , but as thou wilt .
And he commeth vnto the Disciples , and findeth them asleepe , and saith vnto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one houre ?
Watch and pray , that yee enter not into temptation : The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weake .
He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my father , if this cup may not passe away from me , except I drinke it , thy will be done .
And he came and found them asleep againe : For their eies were heauie .
And he left them , and went away againe , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
Then commeth he to his Disciples , and saith vnto them , Sleepe on now , and take your rest , behold , the houre is at hand , and the sonne of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
Rise , let vs be going : behold , he is at hand that doeth betray me .
¶ And while yet spake , loe , Iudas one of the twelue came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staues from the chiefe Priests and Elders of the people .
Now he that betrayed him , gaue them a signe , saying , Whomsoeuer I shall kisse , that same is he , hold him fast .
And forthwith hee came to Iesus , and said , Haile master , and kissed him .
And Iesus said vnto him , Friend , Wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid handes on Iesus , and tooke him .
And behold , one of them which were with Iesus , stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and stroke a seruant of the high Priests , and smote off his eare .
Then said Iesus vnto him , Put vp againe thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword , shall perish with the sword .
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my father , and he shall presently giue me more then twelue legions of Angels ?
But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
In that same houre said Iesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thiefe with swords and staues for to take mee ? I sate daily with you teaching in the Temple , and ye laide no hold on me .
But all this was done , that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the Disciples forsooke him , and fled :
¶ And they that had laid hold on Iesus , led him away to Caiaphas the high Priest , where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled .
But Peter followed him afarre off , vnto the high Priests palace , and went in , and sate with the seruants to see the end .
Now the chiefe Priests and Elders , and all the councell , sought false witnesse against Iesus to put him to death ,
But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
And said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the Temple of God , and to build it in three dayes .
And the high Priest arose , and said vnto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it , which these witnesse against thee ?
But Iesus held his peace . And the high Priest answered , and said vnto him , I adiure thee by the liuing God , that thou tell vs , whether thou bee the Christ the Sonne of God .
Iesus saith vnto him , Thou hast saide : Neuerthelesse I say vnto you , Hereafter shall yee see the Sonne of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heauen .
Then the high Priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemie : what further need haue wee of witnesses ? Behold , now ye haue heard his blasphemie .
What thinke ye ? They answered and said , He is guiltie of death .
Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him , and others smote him with the palmes of their hands ,
Saying , Prophecie vnto vs , thou Christ , who is he that smote thee ?
¶ Now Peter sate without in the palace : and a damosell came vnto him , saying , Thou also wast with Iesus of Galilee .
But hee denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou saiest .
And when he was gone out into the porch , another maide saw him , and saide vnto them that were there , This fellow was also with Iesus of Nazareth .
And againe hee denied with an oath , I doe not know the man .
And after a while came vnto him they that stood by , and saide to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them , for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
Then beganne hee to curse and to sweare , saying , I know not the man . And immediatly the cocke crew .

When the morning was come , all the chiefe Priests and Elders of the people , tooke counsell against Iesus to put him to death .
And when they had bound him , they led him away , and deliuered him to Pontius Pilate the gouernour .
¶ Then Iudas , which had betraied him , when he saw that hee was condemned , repented himselfe , and brought againe the thirtie pieces of siluer to the chiefe Priests and Elders ,
Saying , I haue sinned , in that I haue betraied the innocent blood . And they said , What is that to vs ? see thou to that .
And hee cast downe the pieces of siluer in the Temple , and departed , and went and hanged himselfe .
And the chiefe Priests tooke the siluer pieces , and said , It is not lawfull for to put them into the treasurie , because it is the price of blood .
And they tooke counsell , and bought with them the potters field , to burie strangers in .
Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood vnto this day .
( Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremie the Prophet , saying , And they tooke the thirtie pieces of siluer , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of Israel did value :
And gaue them for the potters field , as the Lord appointed me . )
And Iesus stood before the gouernour , and the gouernour asked him , saying ; Art thou the King of the Iewes ? And Iesus sayd vnto him , Thou sayest .
And when hee was accused of the chiefe Priests and Elders , he answered nothing .
Then saith Pilate vnto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witnesse against thee ?
And he answered him to neuer a word : insomuch that the Gouernour marueiled greatly .
Now at that feast the Gouernor was woont to release vnto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said vnto them , Whom will ye that I release vnto you ? Barabbas , or Iesus , which is called Christ ?
For hee knew that for enuie they had deliuered him .
¶ When he was set downe on the Iudgement seate , his wife sent vnto him , saying , Haue thou nothing to doe with that iust man : for I haue suffered many things this day in a dreame , because of him .
But the chiefe Priestes and Elders perswaded the multitude that they should aske Barabbas , & destroy Iesus .
The Gouernour answered , and said vnto them , Whether of the twaine will ye that I release vnto you ? They said , Barabbas .
Pilate said vnto them , What shall I doe then with Iesus , which is called Christ ? They all sayde vnto him , Let him be crucified .
And the Gouernour said , Why , what euil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
¶ When Pilate saw that he could preuaile nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , hee tooke water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this iust person : see yee to it .
Then answered all the people , and said , His blood be on vs , and on our children .
¶ Then released hee Barabbas vnto them , and when he had scourged Iesus , he deliuered him to be crucified .
Then the souldiers of the Gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall , and gathered vnto him the whole band of souldiers .
And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
¶ And when they had platted a crowne of thornes , they put it vpon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Haile king of the Iewes .
And they spit vpon him , and tooke the reed , and smote him on the head .
And after that they had mocked him , they tooke the robe off from him , and put his owne raiment on him , and led him away to crucifie him .
And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to beare his Crosse .
And when they were come vnto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
¶ They gaue him vineger to drinke , mingled with gall : and when hee had tasted thereof , hee would not drinke .
And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet , They parted my garments among them , and vpon my vesture did they cast lots .
And sitting downe , they watched him there :
And set vp ouer his head , his accusation written , THIS IS IESVS THE KING OF THE IEWES .
Then were there two theeues crucified with him : one on the right hand , and another on the left .
¶ And they that passed by , reuiled him , wagging their heads ,
And saying , Thou that destroyest the Temple , & buildest it in three dayes , saue thy selfe : If thou be the Sonne of God , come downe from the Crosse .
Likewise also the chiefe Priests mocking him , with the Scribes and Elders , said ,
He saued others , himselfe he cannot saue : If he be the King of Israel , let him now come downe from the Crosse , and we will beleeue him .
He trusted in God , let him deliuer him now if hee will haue him : for he said , I am the Sonne of God .
The thieues also which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
Now from the sixth houre there was darkenesse ouer all the land vnto the ninth houre .
And about the ninth houre , Iesus cried with a loud voyce , saying , Eli , Eli , Lamasabachthani , that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken mee ?
Some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elias .
And straightway one of them ran , and tooke a spunge , and filled it with vineger , and put it on a reede , and gaue him to drinke .
The rest said , Let bee , let vs see whether Elias will come to saue him .
¶ Iesus , when hee had cried againe with a loud voice , yeelded vp the ghost .
And behold , the vaile of the Temple was rent in twaine , from the top to the bottome , and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent .
And the graues were opened , and many bodies of Saints which slept , arose ,
And came out of the graues after his resurrection , and went into the holy citie , and appeared vnto many .
Now when the Centurion , and they that were with him , watching Iesus , saw the earthquake , & those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truely this was the Son of God .
And many women were there ( beholding afarre off ) which followed Iesus from Galilee , ministring vnto him .
Among which was Mary Magdalene , & Mary the mother of Iames and Ioses , and the mother of Zebedees children .
When the Euen was come , there came a rich man of Arimathea , named Ioseph , who also himselfe was Iesus disciple :
He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Iesus : then Pilate commanded the body to be deliuered .
And when Ioseph had taken the body , hee wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth ,
And laide it in his owne newe tombe , which he had hewen out in the rocke : and he rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre , and departed .
And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting ouer against the sepulchre .
¶ Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation , the chiefe Priests and Pharisees came together vnto Pilate ,
Saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiuer said , while he was yet aliue , After three daies I wil rise againe .
Command therfore that the sepulchre be made sure , vntill the third day , lest his disciples come by night , & steale him away , and say vnto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last errour shalbe worse then the first .
Pilate said vnto them , Yee haue a watch , goe your way , make it as sure as you can .
<NON-VERSE>
In the ende of the Sabbath , as it began to dawne towards the first day of the weeke , came Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , to see the sepulchre .
And behold , there was a great earthquake , for the Angel of the Lord descended from heauen , and came and rolled backe the stone from the doore , and sate vpon it .
His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snowe .
And for feare of him , the keepers did shake , and became as dead men .
And the Angel answered , and said vnto the women , Feare not ye : for I know that ye seeke Iesus , which was crucified .
He is not here : for he is risen , as hee said : Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
And goe quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead . And behold , hee goeth before you into Galilee , there shall ye see him : loe , I haue told you .
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre , with feare and great ioy , and did run to bring his disciples word .
¶ And as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Iesus met them , saying , All haile . And they came , and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
Then said Iesus vnto them , Be not afraid : Goe tell my brethren that they goe into Galilee , and there shall they see me .
¶ Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the citie , and shewed vnto the chiefe Priests all the things that were done .
And when they were assembled with the Elders , and had taken counsell , they gaue large money vnto the souldiers ,
Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
And if this come to the gouernours eares , wee will perswade him , and secure you .
So they tooke the money , and did as they were taught . And this saying is commonly reported among the Iewes vntill this day .
¶ Then the eleuen disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountaine where Iesus had appointed them .
And when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted .
And Iesus came , and spake vnto them , saying , All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth .
¶ Goe ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the Name of the Father , and of the Sonne , and of the holy Ghost :

The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the dayes of Iotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah Kings of Iudah , which hee saw concerning Samaria and Ierusalem .
Heare all ye people , hearken O earth , and all that therein is , and let the Lord God be witnesse against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
For behold , the Lord commeth forth out of his place , and will come downe and tread vpon the high places of the earth .
And the mountaines shall be molten vnder him , and the valleis shall be cleft : as waxe before the fire , and as the waters that are powred downe a steepe place .
For the transgression of Iacob is all this , and for the sinnes of the house of Israel : What is the transgression of Iacob ? Is it not Samaria ? and what are the high places of Iudah ? are they not Ierusalem ?
Therfore I will make Samaria as an heape of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard ; and I will powre downe the stones therof into the valley , and I will discouer the foundations thereof .
And all the grauen images thereof shall be beaten to pieces , and all the hires thereof shall be burnt with the fire , and all the idoles therof will I lay desolate : for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot , and they shall returne to the hire of an harlot .
Therfore I wil waile and houle , I will goe stript and naked : I will make a wailing like the dragons , and mourning as the owles .
For her wound is incurable , for it is come vnto Iudah : he is come vnto the gate of my people , euen to Ierusalem .
¶ Declare yee it not at Gath , weepe yee not at all : In the house of Aphrah rowle thy selfe in the dust .
Passe yee away thou inhabitant of Saphir , hauing thy shame naked ; the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth - ezel , he shall receiue of you his standing .
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good , but euill came downe from the Lord vnto the gate of Ierusalem .
O thou inhabitant of Lachish , bind the charet to the swift beast : she is the beginning of the sinne to the daughter of Zion : for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee .
Therfore shalt thou giue presents to Moresheth - Gath : the houses of Achzib shalbe a lie to the kings of Israel .
Yet wil I bring an heire vnto thee , O inhabitant of Mareshah : he shall come vnto Adullam , the glory of Israel

Woe to them that deuise iniquitie , and worke euill vpon their beds : when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
And they couet fields and take them by violence : and houses , and take them away : so they oppresse a man and his house , euen a man and his heritage .
Therefore thus saith the Lord , Behold , against this familie doe I deuise an euill , from which ye shall not remoue your necks , neither shall ye goe haughtily : for this time is euill .
¶ In that day shall one take vp a parable against you , and lament with a dolefull lamentation , and say , We be vtterly spoiled : hee hath changed the portion of my people : how hath he remoued it from me ? turning away hee hath diuided our fields .
Therefore thou shalt haue none that shall cast a cord by lot in the Congregation of the Lord .
Prophecie ye not , say they , to them that prophecie : they shall not prophecie to them , that they shall not take shame .
¶ O thou that art named the house of Iacob , is the Spirit of the Lord straitned ? are these his dongs ? doe not my words do good to him that walketh vprightly ?
Euen of late , my people is risen vp as an enemie : ye pull off the robe with the garment , from them that passe by securely , as men auerse from warre .
The women of my people haue ye cast out from their pleasant houses , from their children haue ye taken away my glory for euer .
Arise ye and depart , for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you euen with a sore destruction .
If a man walking in the spirit and falshood , doe lie , saying , I will prophecie vnto thee of wine and of strong drinke , he shall euen bee the prophet of this people .
¶ I will surely assemble , O Iacob , all of thee : I will surely gather the remnant of Israel , I will put them together as the sheepe of Bozrah , as the flocke in the midst of their fold : they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men .

And I said , Heare , I pray you , O heads of Iacob , and ye princes of the house of Israel : is it not for you to know iudgement ?
Who hate the good and loue the euill , who plucke off their skinne from off them , and their flesh from off their bones .
Who also eate the flesh of my people , and flay their skinne from off them , and they breake their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the cauldron .
Then shall they cry vnto the Lord , but he will not heare them : he will euen hide his face from them at that time , as they haue behaued themselues ill in their doings .
¶ Thus saith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my people erre , that bite with their teeth and crie ; Peace : and he that putteth not into their mouths , they euen prepare warre against him :
Therefore night shall be vnto you , that yee shall not haue a vision , and it shall be darke vnto you , that yee shall not diuine , and the Sunne shall goe downe ouer the Prophets , and the day shall be darke ouer them .
Then shall the seers be ashamed , and the diuiners confounded : yea , they shall all couer their lips ; for there is no answere of God .
¶ But truely I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord , and of iudgment and of might , to declare vnto Iacob his transgression , and to Israel his sinne .
Heare this , I pray you , yee heads of the house of Iacob , and princes of the house of Israel , that abhorre iudgement and peruert all equitie .
They build vp Zion with blood , and Ierusalem with iniquitie .
The heads thereof iudge for reward , and the priests thereof teach for hyre , and the Prophets thereof diuine for money : yet will they leane vpon the Lord , and say ; Is not the Lord among vs ? none euill can come vpon vs .

But in the last dayes it shal come to passe , that the mountaine of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountaines , and it shalbe exalted aboue the hilles , and people shall flow vnto it .
And many nations shall come , and say ; Come , and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord , and to the house of the God of Iacob , and he will teach vs of his wayes , and wee will walke in his pathes : for the Law shall goe foorth of Zion , and the word of the Lord from Ierusalem .
¶ And he shall iudge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afarre off , and they shall beate their swords into plowshares , and their speares into pruning hookes : nation shall not lift vp a sword against nation , neither shall they learne warre any more .
But they shall sit euery man vnder his Uine , and vnder his figgetree , and none shal make them afraid : for the mouth of the Lord of hostes hath spoken it .
For all people will walke euery one in the name of his god , and we will walke in the Name of the Lord our God for euer and euer .
In that day , saith the Lord , will I assemble her that halteth , and I will gather her that is driuen out , and her that I haue afflicted .
And I will make her that halted , a remnant ; and her that was cast farre off , a strong nation ; and the Lord shall reigne ouer them , in Mount Zion from hencefoorth , euen for euer .
¶ And thou , O towre of the flock , the strong hold of the daughter of Zion , vnto thee shall it come , euen the first dominion , the kingdome shall come to the daughter of Ierusalem .
Now why doest thou cry out alowd ? is there no king in thee ? is thy counseller perished ? for pangs haue taken thee , as a woman in trauell .
Bee in paine and labour to bring forth , O daughter of Zion , like a woman in trauell : for now shalt thou goe foorth out of the citie , and thou shalt dwel in the field , and thou shalt go euen to Babylon : there shalt thou be deliuered : there the Lord shall redeeme thee from the hand of thine enemies .
¶ Now also many nations are gathered against thee , that say , Let her be defiled , & let our eye look vpon Zion .
But they know not the thoughts of the Lord , neither vnderstand they his counsell : for hee shall gather them as the sheaues into the floore .

Now gather thy selfe in troupes , O daughter of troupes : he hath laid siege against vs : they shal smite the Iudge of Israel with a rod vpon the cheeke .
But thou Beth - leem Ephratah , though thou bee little among the thousands of Iudah , yet out of thee shall he come foorth vnto mee , that is to be ruler in Israel : whose goings foorth haue bene from of old , from euerlasting .
Therefore will hee giue them vp , vntill the time that shee which trauaileth , hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall returne vnto the children of Israel .
¶ And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord , in the Maiestie of the Name of the Lord his God , and they shall abide : for now shall he be great vnto the ends of the earth .
And this man shall bee the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when hee shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seuen Shepheards , and eight principall men .
And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof : thus shall hee deliuer vs from the Assyrian , when he commeth into our land , and when hee treadeth within our borders .
And the remnant of Iacob shall be in the midst of many people , as a dew from the Lord , as the showres vpon the grasse that tarieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sonnes of men .
¶ And the remnant of Iacob shal be among the Gentiles in the middest of many people , as a Lyon among the beasts of the forrest , as a yong Lyon among the flockes of sheepe : who if he goe through , both treadeth downe , and teareth in pieces , and none can deliuer .
Thine hand shall be lift vp vpon thine aduersaries , and all thine enemies shalbe cut off .
And it shall come to passe in that day , sayth the Lord , that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee , and I will destroy thy charets .
And I will cut off the cities of thy land , and throw downe all thy strong holdes .
And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand , and thou shalt haue no more Southsayers .
Thy grauen images also will I cut off , and thy standing images out of the midst of thee : & thou shalt no more worship the worke of thine hands .
And I will plucke vp thy groues out of the middest of thee : so will I destroy thy cities .

For I brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed thee out of the house of seruants , and I sent before thee Moses , Aaron and Miriam .
O my people , remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted , and what Balaam the sonne of Beor answered him from Shittim vnto Gilgal , that yee may know the righteousnesse of the Lord .
¶ Wherewith shall I come before the Lord , and bow my selfe before the high God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calues of a yeere olde ?

Hee hath shewed thee , O man , what is good ; and what doeth the Lord require of thee , but to do iustly , and to loue mercy , and to walke humbly with thy God ?
Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances , and with the bag of deceitfull weights ?
For the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof haue spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitfull in their mouth .
Therefore also will I make thee sicke in smiting thee , in making thee desolate , because of thy sinnes .
Thou shalt eate , but not be satisfied , and thy casting downe shall be in the midst of thee , and thou shalt take holde , but shalt not deliuer : & that which thou deliuerest , will I giue vp to the sword .
Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reape : thou shalt tread the oliues , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oile ; & sweet wine , but shalt not drinke wine .

Woe is mee , for I am as when they haue gathered the summer fruits , as the grape gleanings of the vintage : there is no cluster to eate : my soule desired the first ripe fruit .
The good man is perished out of the earth , and there is none vpright among men : they all lie in waite for blood : they hunt euery man his brother with a net .
¶ That they may doe euill with both hands earnestly , the prince asketh , and the iudge asketh for a reward : and the great man , he vttereth his mischieuous desire : so they wrap it vp .
The best of them is as a brier : the most vpright is sharper then a thorne hedge : the day of thy watchmen , and thy visitation commeth ; now shall be their perplexitie .
¶ Trust yee not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keepe the doores of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy bosome .
For the sonne dishonoureth the father : the daughter riseth vp against her mother : the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a mans enemies are the men of his owne house .
Therefore I will looke vnto you the Lord : I will waite for the God of my saluation : my God will heare me .
¶ Reioyce not against mee , O mine enemie : When I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darknes , the Lord shall be a light vnto me .
I will beare the indignation of the Lord , because I haue sinned against him , vntill he plead my cause , and execute iudgement for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousnesse .
Then she that is mine enemie shall see it , and shame shall couer her which said vnto mee ; Where is the Lord thy God ? mine eyes shall behold her : now shall she bee troden downe , as the myre of the streets .
In the day that thy walles are to be built , in that day shall the decree bee farre remoued .
In that day also he shal come euen to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortresse euen to the riuer , and from Sea to Sea , and from mountaine to mountaine ;
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruite of their doings .
¶ Feede thy people with thy rod , the flocke of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of Carmel : let them feede in Bashan and Gilead , as in the dayes of old .
According to the dayes of thy comming out of the land of Egypt will I shew vnto him meruailous things .
¶ The nations shall see , and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand vpon their mouth : their eares shall be deafe .
They shall licke the dust like a serpent , they shall moue out of their holes like wormes of the earth : they shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall feare because of thee .
Who is a God like vnto thee , that pardoneth iniquitie , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? hee retaineth not his anger for euer , because he delighteth in mercy .
He wil turne againe , he will haue compassion vpon vs : he will subdue our iniquities , and thou wilt cast all their sinnes into the depths of the Sea .

The burden of Nineueh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite .
God is ielous , and the Lord reuengeth : the Lord reuengeth , and is furious , the Lord wil take vengeance on his aduersaries , and he reserueth wrath for his enemies .
The Lord is slow to anger , and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked : the Lord hath his way in the whirlewind , and in the storme , and the clouds are the dust of his feete .
He rebuketh the sea , and maketh it drie , and drieth vp all the riuers : Bashan languisheth , and Carmel , and the floure of Lebanon languisheth .
The mountaines quake at him , and the hilles melt , and the earth is burnt at his presence , yea the world and all that dwell therein .
Who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fiercenesse of his anger ? his furie is powred out like fire , and the rocks are throwen downe by him .
The Lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble , & he knoweth them that trust in him .
But with an ouer - running flood he will make an vtter ende of the place thereof , and darkenesse shall pursue his enemies .
What doe ye imagine against the Lord ? he will make an vtter ende : affliction shall not rise vp the second time .
For while they be folden together as thornes , and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be deuoured as stubble fully drie .
There is one come out of thee , that imagineth euill against the Lord : a wicked counseller .
Thus saith the Lord , Though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut downe , when he shall passe through : though I haue afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more .
For now will I breake his yoke from off thee , and will burst thy bonds in sunder .
And the Lord hath giuen a commandement concerning thee , that no more of thy name be sowen : out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the grauen image , and the molten image , I wil make thy graue , for thou art vile .

He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face : keep the munition , watch the way : make thy loines strong : fortifie thy power mightily .
For the Lord hath turned away the excellencie of Iacob , as the excellencie of Israel : for the emptiers haue emptied them out , and marred their vine branches .
The shield of his mightie men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the charets shall bee with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the firre trees shall bee terribly shaken .
The charets shall rage in the streets , they shall iustle one against another in the broad wayes : they shall seeme like torches , they shall runne like the lightnings .
Hee shall recount his worthies : they shall stumble in their walke : they shall make haste to the wal thereof , and the defence shall bee prepared .
The gates of the riuers shall bee opened , and the palace shall bee dissolued .
And Huzzab shall be led away captiue , she shall be brought vp , and her maids shall leade her as with the voyce of doues , tabring vpon their breasts .
But Nineueh is of olde like a poole of water : yet they shall flee away . Stand , stand shall they cry : but none shal looke backe .
Where is the dwelling of the Lions , and the feeding place of the yong Lions ? where the Lion , euen the olde Lion walked , and the Lions whelpe , and none made them afraid .
The Lion did teare in pieces enough for his whelpes , and strangled for his Lionesses , and filled his holes with pray , and his dens with rauine .

Woe to the bloody City , it is all full of lyes and robberie , the pray departeth not .

The horseman lifteth vp both the bright sword , & the glittering speare , and there is a multitude of slaine , and a great number of carkeises : and there is none ende of their corpses : they stumble vpon their corpses ,
Because of the multitude of the whoredomes of the wel - fauoured harlot , the mistresse of witchcrafts , that selleth nations through her whoredomes , and families through her witchcrafts .
Behold , I am against thee , saith the Lord of hostes , and I will discouer thy skirtes vpon thy face , and I will shew the nations thy nakednesse , and the kingdomes thy shame .
And I will cast abominable filth vpon thee , and make thee vile , and will set thee as a gazing stocke .
And it shall come to passe , that all they that looke vpon thee , shall flee from thee , and say ; Nineueh is layde waste , who will bemoane her ? whence shall I seeke comforters for thee ?
Art thou better then populous No , that was scituate among the riuers that had the waters round about it , whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength , and it was infinit , Put and Lubim were thy helpers .
Yet was she caried away , she went into captiuitie : her yong children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streetes : and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound in chaines .
Thou also shalt be drunken : thou shalt bee hid , thou also shalt seeke strength because of the enemie .
All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the first ripe figs : if they bee shaken , they shall euen fall into the mouth of the eater .
Beholde , thy people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of thy land shall be set wide open vnto thine enemies , the fire shall deuoure thy barres .
Draw thee waters for the siege : fortifie thy strong holdes , goe into clay , and tread the morter : make strong the bricke - kill .
There shall the fire deuoure thee : the sword shall cut thee off : it shall eate thee vp like the cankerworme : make thy selfe many as the cankerworme , make thy selfe many as the locusts .
Thou hast multiplied thy merchants aboue the starres of heauen ; the cankerworme spoileth & flieth away .
The crowned are as the locusts , and thy captains as the great grashoppers which campe in the hedges in the cold day : but when the Sunne ariseth , they flee away , and their place is not knowen where they are .
Thy shepheards slumber , O king of Assyria : thy nobles shall dwell in the dust : thy people is scattered vpon the mountaines , & no man gathereth them .

The words of Nehemiah the sonne of Hachaliah . And it came to passe in the moneth Chisleu , in the twentieth yeere , as I was in Shushan the palace ;
That Hanani , one of my brethren came , he and certaine men of Iudah , and I asked them concerning the Iewes that had escaped , which were left of the captiuitie , and concerning Ierusalem .
And they said vnto me , The remnant that are left of the captiuitie there in the prouince , are in great affliction and reproch : the wall of Ierusalem also is broken downe , and the gates thereof are burnt with fire .
¶ And it came to passe when I heard these words , that I sate downe and wept , and mourned certaine dayes , and fasted , and prayed before the God of heauen ,
And said , I beseech thee , O Lord God of heauen , the great and terrible God , that keepeth couenant and mercie for them that loue him , and obserue his commandements :
Let thine eare now be attentiue , and thine eyes open , that thou mayest heare the prayer of thy seruant , which I pray before thee now , day and night , for the children of Israel thy seruants , and confesse the sinnes of the children of Israel , which wee haue sinned against thee : both I , and my fathers house haue sinned .
We haue dealt very corruptly against thee , and haue not kept the commandements , nor the statutes , nor the iudgements , which thou commandedst thy seruant Moses .
Remember , I beseech thee , the word that thou commandedst thy seruant Moses , saying , If yee transgresse , I will scatter you abroad among the nations :
But if ye turne vnto me , and keepe my commandements , and doe them : though there were of you cast out vnto the vttermost part of the heauen , yet will I gather them from thence , and will bring them vnto the place that I haue chosen , to set my Name there .
Now these are thy seruants , and thy people , whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power , and by thy strong hand .

And it came to passe , in the moneth Nisan , in the twentieth yeere of Artaxerxes the king , that wine was before him : and I tooke vp the wine , and gaue it vnto the King : now I had not bene beforetime sad in his presence .
Wherefore the king said vnto me , Why is thy countenance sadde , seeing thou art not sicke ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . Then I was very sore afraid ,
And said vnto the king , Let the king liue for euer : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers Sepulchres , lyeth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
Then the king said vnto me , For what doest thou make request ? So I prayed to the God of heauen .
And I said vnto the king , If it please the king , and if thy seruant haue found fauour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me vnto Iudah vnto the City of my fathers sepulchres , that I may build it .
And the king saide vnto mee ( the Queene also sitting by him ) For how long shall thy iourney bee ? and when wilt thou returne ? So it pleased the king to send me , and I set him a time .
Moreouer I saide vnto the king , If it please the king , let letters be giuen mee to the gouernours beyond the Riuer , that they may conuey me ouer , till I come into Iudah ;
And a letter vnto Asaph the keeper of the kings forrest , that he may giue me timber to make beames for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house , and for the wall of the Citie , and for the house that I shall enter into : And the king granted me , according to the good hand of my God vpon me .
¶ Then I came to the gouernours beyond the riuer , and gaue them the kings letters : ( now the king had sent captaines of the army , and horsemen with me . )
When Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the seruant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieued them exceedingly , that there was come a man , to seeke the welfare of the children of Israel .
So I came to Ierusalem , and was there three dayes .
¶ And I arose in the night , I , and some few men with mee , neither tolde I any man what God had put in my heart to doe at Ierusalem : neither was there any beast with mee , saue the beast that I rode vpon .
And I went out by night , by the gate of the valley , euen before the dragon well , and to the doung - port , and viewed the walls of Ierusalem , which were broken downe , and the gates thereof were consumed with fire .
Then I went on to the gate of the fountaine , and to the kings poole : but there was no place for the beast that was vnder me , to passe .
Then went I vp in the night by the brooke , and viewed the wall , and turned backe , and entred by the gate of the valley , and so returned .
And the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did , neither had I as yet tolde it to the Iewes , nor to the Priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the worke .
¶ Then said I vnto them , Yee see the distresse that we are in , how Ierusalem lieth waste , and the gates therof are burnt with fire : come , and let vs builde vp the wall of Ierusalem , that we be no more a reproch .
Then I told them of the hand of my God , which was good vpon me ; as also the kings wordes that he had spoken vnto me . And they said , Let vs rise vp and builde . So they strengthened their hands for this good worke .
But when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the seruant the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian heard it , they laughed vs to scorne , and despised vs , and said , What is this thing that yee doe ? will ye rebell against the king ?

But it came to passe , that when Sanballat heard , that we builded the wall , he was wroth , and tooke great indignation , and mocked the Iewes .
And he spake before his brethren , and the army of Samaria , and said , What doe these feeble Iewes ? wil they fortifie themselues ? will they sacrifice ? wil they make an end in a day ? wil they reuiue the stones , out of the heapes of the rubbish , which are burnt ?
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , Euen that which they build , if a foxe goe vp , he shall euen breake downe their stone wall .
Heare , O our God , for we are despised : and turne their reproch vpon their owne head , and giue them for a pray , in the land of captiuitie .
And couer not their iniquitie , and let not their sinne bee blotted out from before thee : for they haue prouoked thee to anger before the builders .
So built we the wall , and all the wall was ioyned together vnto the halfe therof : for the people had a minde to worke .
¶ But it came to passe that when Sanballat and Tobiah , and the Arabians , and the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites , heard that the walles of Ierusalem were made vp , and that the breaches began to bee stopped , then they were very wroth ,
And conspired all of them together , to come and to fight against Ierusalem , and to hinder it .
Neuertheles , we made our prayer vnto our God , and set a watch against them , day and night , because of them .
And Iudah said , The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed , and there is much rubbish , so that we are not able to build the wall .
And our aduersaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till wee come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the worke to cease .
And it came to passe that when the Iewes which dwelt by them , came , they said vnto vs ten time , From all places , whence yee shall returne vnto vs , they will be vpon you .
¶ Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I euen set the people , after their families , with their swords , their speares , and their bowes .
And I looked , and rose vp , and said vnto the Nobles , and to the rulers , and to rest of the people , Bee not ye afraid of them : Remember the Lord which is great and terrible , and fight for your brethren , your sonnes and your daughters , your wiues & your houses .
And it came to passe when our enemies heard that it was knowen vnto vs , and God had brought their counsell to nought , that we returned all of vs to the wall , euery one vnto his worke .
And it came to passe from that time forth , that the halfe of my seruants wrought in the worke , and the other halfe of them held both the speares , the shields and the bowes , and the habergeons , and the rulers were behind all the house of Iudah .
They which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , euery one with one of his hands wrought in the worke , and with the other hand held a weapon .
For the builders , euery one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded : and he that sounded the trumpet was by mee .
¶ And I said vnto the Nobles , and to the rulers , and to the rest of the people , The worke is great and large , and wee are separated vpon the wall , one farre from another :
In what place therefore ye heare the sound of the trumpet , resort ye thither vnto vs : our God shal fight for vs .
So wee laboured in the worke : and halfe of them held the speares , from the rising of the morning , til the starres appeared .
Likewise at the same time said I vnto the people , Let euery one , with his seruant , lodge within Ierusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to vs , and labour on the day .
<NON-VERSE>
And there was a great crie of the people , and of their wiues , against their brethren the Iewes .
For there were that said , We , our sonnes , and our daughters are many : therefore wee take vp corne for them , that we may eat , and liue .
Some also there were that saide , We haue morgaged our landes , vineyards and houses , that we might buy corne , because of the dearth .
There were also that said , Wee haue borrowed money for the kings tribute , and that vpon our lands and vineyards .
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren , our children as their children : and loe , wee bring into bondage our sonnes and our daughters , to bee seruants , and some of our daughters are brought vnto bondage already , neither is it in our power to redeeme them : for other men haue our lands and vineyards .
¶ And I was very angry , when I heard their crie , and these words .
Then I consulted with my selfe , and I rebuked the Nobles , and the rulers , and said vnto them , You exact vsurie , euery one of his brother . And I set a great assembly against them :
And I said vnto them , We , after our abilitie , haue redeemed our brethren the Iewes , which were sold vnto the heathen ; and will you euen sell your brethren ? or shall they be sold vnto vs ? Then held they their peace , and found nothing to answere .
Also I said , It is not good that yee doe : ought yee not to walke in the feare of our God , because of the reproch of the heathen our enemies ?
I likewise , and my brethren , and my seruants , might exact of them money and corne : I pray you let vs leaue off this vsurie .
Restore , I pray you , to them , euen this day , their lands , their vineyards , their oliue - yards , and their houses , also the hundreth part of the money , and of the corne , the wine , and the oyle , that ye exact of them .
Then said they , Wee will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we doe , as thou sayest . Then I called the Priests , and tooke an oath of them , that they should doe according to this promise .
Also I shooke my lap , and said , So God shake out euery man from his house , and from his labour , that performeth not this promise , euen thus be he shaken out , and emptied . And all the Congregation said , Amen , and praised the Lord . And the people did according to this promise .
¶ Moreouer , from the time that I was appointed to be their gouernor in the land of Iudah , from the twentieth yeere euen vnto the two and thirtieth yere of Artaxerxes the king , that is , twelue yeres , I and my brethren , haue not eaten the bread of the gouernour :
But the former gouernours that had bene before me , were chargeable vnto the people , and had taken of them bread , and wine , beside fourtie shekels of siluer , yea euen their seruants bare rule ouer the people : but so did not I , because of the feare of God .
Yea also I continued in the worke of this wall , neither bought wee any land : and all my seruants were gathered thither vnto the worke .
Moreouer , there were at my table , an hundred and fiftie of the Iewes and rulers , besides those that came vnto vs from among the heathen that are about vs .
Now that which was prepared for me daily , was one oxe , and sixe choice sheepe ; also foules were prepared for mee , and once in ten dayes , store of all sorts of wine : yet for all this required not I the bread of the gouernour , because the bondage was heauy vpon this people .

Now it came to passe when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and Geshem the Arabian , and the rest of our enemies heard , that I had builded the wall , and that there was no breach left therein : ( though at that time I had not set vp the doores vpon the gates , )
That Sanballat , and Geshem sent vnto me , saying , Come , let vs meet together in some one of the villages in the plaine of Ono : But they thought to doe me mischiefe .
And I sent messengers vnto them , saying , I am doing a great worke , so that I can not come down : why should the worke cease , whilest I leaue it , and come downe to you ?
Yet they sent vnto me foure times , after this sort ; and I answered them after the same maner .
Then sent Sanballat his seruant vnto me , in like manner , the fifth time , with an open letter in his hand :
Wherein was written ; It is reported among the heathen , and Gashmu sayth it , that thou and the Iewes thinke to rebell : for which cause thou buildest the wall , that thou mayest be their King , according to these words .
And thou hast also appointed Prophets to preach of thee at Ierusalem , saying , There is a King in Iudah . And now shall it be reported to the king , according to these wordes . Come now therefore , and let vs take counsell together .
Then I sent vnto him , saying , There are no such things done as thou sayest , but thou feignest them out of thine owne heart .
For they all made vs afraid , saying , Their handes shall be weakened from the worke that it bee not done . Now therefore , O God , strengthen my hands .
Afterward I came vnto the house of Shemaiah the sonne of Delaiah , the sonne of Mehetabel , who was shut vp , and he said , Let vs meet together in the house of God , within the Temple , and let vs shut the doores of the Temple ; for they will come to slay thee , yea in the night wil they come to slay thee .
And I said , Should such a man as I , flee ? and who is there , that being as I am , would goe into the Temple to saue his life ? I will not goe in .
And loe , I perceiued that God had not sent him , but that he pronounced this prophecie against mee : for Tobiah , and Sanballat had hired him .
Therefore was hee hired , that I should be afraid , and doe so , and sinne , and that they might haue matter for an euill report , that they might reproch mee .
My God , thinke thou vpon Tobiah , and Sanballat , according to these their workes , and on the prophetesse Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would haue put me in feare .
¶ So the wall was finished , in the twentie and fifth day of the moneth Elul , in fiftie and two dayes .
And it came to passe that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen , that were about vs , saw these things , they were much cast downe in their owne eyes : for they perceiued that this worke was wrought of our God .
¶ Moreouer , in those dayes the nobles of Iudah sent many letters vnto Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came vnto them .
For there were many in Iudah sworne vnto him : because hee was the sonne in law of Shechaniah the sonne of Arah , and his sonne Iohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam , the sonne of Berechiah .
<NON-VERSE>
Now it came to passe when the wall was built , and I had set vp the doores ; and the porters , and the singers , and the Leuites were appointed ,
That I gaue my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge ouer Ierusalem ( for hee was a faithfull man , and feared God aboue many . )
And I said vnto them , Let not the gates of Ierusalem be opened , vntill the Sunne bee hot ; and while they stand by , let them shut the doores , and barre them . And appoint watches of the inhabitants of Ierusalem , euery one in his wateh , and euery one to bee ouer against his house .
Now the city was large and great , but the people were few therein , and the houses were not builded .
¶ And my God put into mine heart , to gather together the nobles , and the rulers , & the people , that they might be reckoned by genealogie . And I found a register of the genealogie of them which came vp at the first , and found written therein ; These are the children of the prouince , that went vp out of the captiuitie , of those that had beene caried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon had caried away , and came againe to Ierusalem and to Iudah , euery one vnto his citie :
Who came with Zerubbabel , Ieshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Biguai , Nahum , Baanah . The number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel , was this : The children of Parosh , two thousand , an hundred , seuentie and two .
The children of Shephatiah , three hundred , seuentie and two . The children of Arah , sixe hundred , fiftie and two .
The children of Pahath - Moab , of the children of Ieshua , and Ioab , two thousand , and eight hundred , and eighteene .
The children of Elam , a thousand , two hundred , fiftie and foure . The children of Zattu , eight hundred fourtie and fiue .
The children of Binnui , sixe hundred , fourty and eight . The children of Bebai , sixe hundred , twentie and eight .

The men of Bethel and Ai , an hundred , twentie and three . The men of the other Nebo , fiftie and two .
The children of Iericho , three hundred , fourtie and fiue . The children of Lod , Hadid , and Ono , seuen hundred , twentie and one .
The children of Pashur , a thousand , two hundred , fourtie and seuen .
The children of Harim , a thousand , and seuenteene .
¶ The singers . The children of Asaph , an hundred , fourtie and eight . ¶ The porters . The children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , an hundred , thirtie and eight .
The children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Tamiah ,
The children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha . ¶ The children of Solomons seruants : The children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,
The children of Iaala , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel , The children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Zebaim , the children of Amon ,
All the Nethinims , and the children of Solomons seruants , were three hundred ninetie and two . And these were they which went vp also from Tel - Melah , Tel - Haresha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer : but they could not shewe their fathers house , nor their seede , whether they were of Israel .
The children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , sixe hundred fourtie and two .
¶ And of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which tooke one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
These sought their register , among those that were reckoned by genealogie , but it was not found : therfore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
And the Tirshatha said vnto them , that they should not eate of the most holy things , till there stood vp a priest with Urim and Thummim . ¶ The whole congregation together , was fourtie and two thousand , three hundred and threescore :
And that which the rest of the people gaue , was twentie thousand drammes of gold , and two thousand pound of siluer , and threescore and seuen priests garments .
<NON-VERSE>
And all the people gathered themselues together , as one man , into the street that was before the water gate , and they spake vnto Ezra the scribe , to bring the booke of the Law of Moses , which the Lord had commanded to Israel .
And Ezra the priest brought the Law before the Congregation , both of men and women , and all that could heare with vnderstanding , vpon the first day of the seuenth moneth .
And hee read therein before the street that was before the water gate , from the morning vntill midday , before the men and the women , and those that could vnderstand : And the eares of all the people were attentiue vnto the booke of the law .
And Ezra the scribe , stood vpon a pulpit of wood , which they had made for the purpose , and beside him stood Mattithiah , and Shema , and Anaiah , and Urijah , and Hilkiah , and Maaseiah , on his right hand : and on his left hand , Pedaiah , and Mishael , and Malchiah , and Hashum , and Hashbadana , Zechariah , and Meshullam .
And Ezra opened the booke in the sight of all the people ( for hee was aboue al the people ) and when he opened it , all the people stood vp :
And Ezra blessed the Lord the great God : and al the people answered , Amen , Amen , with lifting vp their hands : and they bowed their heads , and worshipped the Lord , with their faces to the ground .
Also Ieshua and Bani , and Sherebiah , Iamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodijah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Iozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Leuites , caused the people to vnderstand the law : and the people stood in their place .
So they read in the booke , in the Law of God distinctly , and gaue the sense , and caused them to vnderstand the reading .
¶ And Nehemiah , which is the Tirshatha , and Ezra the Priest the Scribe , and the Leuites that taught the people , said vnto all the people , This day is holy vnto the Lord your God , mourne not , nor weepe : for all the people wept , when they heard the words of the Law .
Then hee sayd vnto them , Goe your way , eat the fat , & drinke the sweet , and send portions vnto them , for whom nothing is prepared : for this day is holy vnto our Lord : neither be ye sory , for the ioy of the Lord is your strength .
So the Leuites stilled all the people , saying , Holde your peace , for the day is holy , neither be ye grieued .
And all the people went their way to eate , and to drinke , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had vnderstood the wordes that were declared vnto them .
¶ And on the second day were gathered together the chiefe of the fathers of all the people , the Priestes and the Leuites , vnto Ezra the Scribe , euen to vnderstand the wordes of the Law .
And they found written in the Law whith the Lord had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in boothes , in the feast of the seuenth moneth :
And that they should publish and proclaime in all their cities , and in Ierusalem , saying , Goe foorth vnto the mount , and fetch Oliue branches , and Pine branches , and Myrtle branches , and Palme branches , and branches of thicke trees , to make boothes , as it is written .
¶ So the people went foorth , and brought them , and made themselues boothes , euery one vpon the roofe of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the streete of the water - gate , and in the streete of the gate of Ephraim .
And all the congregation of them that were come againe out of the captiuitie , made boothes , and sate vnder the boothes : for since the dayes of Ieshua the sonne of Nun , vnto that day , had not the children of Israel done so : and there was very great gladnesse .

Now in the twentie and fourth day of this moneth , the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , & with sackclothes , and earth vpon them .
And the seede of Israel separated themselues from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sinnes , and the iniquities of their fathers .
And they stood vp in their place , and read in the booke of the Law of the Lord their God , one fourth part of the day , and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the Lord their God .
¶ Then stoode vp , vpon the staires of the Leuites , Ieshua and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani , and cryed with a loude voice vnto the Lord their God .
Then the Leuites , Ieshua and Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabniah , Sherebiah , Hodiiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah , sayde , Stand vp , and blesse the Lord your God for euer and euer , and blessed bee thy glorious Name , which is exalted aboue all blessing and praise .
Thou , euen thou art Lord alone , thou hast made heauen , the heauen of heauens , with all their hoste , the earth , and all things that are therein , the seas , and all that is therin , and thou preseruest them all , and the hoste of heauen worshippeth thee .
Thou art the Lord the God , who diddest choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Caldees , and gauest him the name of Abraham :
And foundest his heart faithfull before thee , & madest a couenant with him , to giue the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Iebusites , and the Girgashites , to giue it , I say , to his seed , and hast performed thy words , for thou art righteous ,
And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heardest their cry by the red Sea ,
And shewedst signes and wonders vpon Pharaoh , and on all his seruants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudlie against them : so didst thou get thee a name , as it is this day .
And thou didst diuide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the drie land , and their persecutours thou threwest into the deepes , as a stone into the mightie waters .
Moreouer thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar , and in the night , by a pillar of fire , to giue them light in the way wherin they should go .
Thou camest downe also vpon mount Sinai , and spakest with them from heauen , and gauest them right iudgements , and true lawes , good statutes and commandements :
And madest knowen vnto them thy holy Sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and lawes , by the hand of Moses thy seruant :
And gauest them bread from heauen for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rocke , for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should goe in to possesse the land , which thou hadst sworne to giue them .
But they and our fathers dealt proudly , and hardened their necks , and hearkned not to thy commandements :
And refused to obey , neither were mindful of the wonders that thou didst among them : but hardened their necks , and in their rebellion appointed a captaine to returne to their bondage : but thou art a God ready to pardon , gracious and mercifull , slow to anger , and of great kindnes , & forsookest them not .
Yea when they had made them a molten calfe , and said , This is thy God , that brought thee vp out of Egypt , and had wrought great prouocations :
Yet thou , in thy manifold mercies , forsookest them not in the wildernesse : the pillar of the cloude departed not from them by day , to leade them in the way , neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew them light , and the way wherin they should goe .
Thou gauest also thy good spirit , to instruct them , and withheldest not thy Manna from their mouth , and gauest them water for their thirst .
Yea fourtie yeeres diddest thou sustaine them in the wildernesse , so that they lacked nothing ; their clothes wared not old , and their feet swelled not .
Moreouer , thou gauest them kingdomes and nations , and didst diuide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Sihon , and the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
Their children also multipliedst thou as the starres of heauen , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should goe in to possesse it .
So the children went in , and possessed the land , and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the lande , the Canaanites , and gauest them into their hands , with their kings , and the people of the land , that they might doe with them , as they would .
And they tooke strong cities , and a fat land , and possessed houses ful of all goods , welles digged , vineyards , and Olive yards , and fruit trees in abundance : So they did eat and were filled , and became fat , and delighted themselues in thy great goodnesse .
Neuerthelesse , they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backes , and slewe thy prophets , which testified against them to turne them to thee , and they wrought great prouocations .
Therefore thou deliueredst them into the hande of their enemies , who vexed them , & in the time of their trouble , when they cried vnto thee , thou heardest them from heauen : and according to thy manifold mercies , thou gauest them sauiours , who saued them out of the hand of their enemies .
But after they had rest , they did euill againe before thee : therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies , so that they had the dominion ouer them : yet when they returned and cried vnto thee , thou heardest them from heauen , and many times didst thou deliuer them , according to thy mercies :
And testifiedst against them , that thou mightest bring them againe vnto thy lawe : yet they dealt proudly , and hearkened not vnto thy commaundements , but sinned against thy iudgements , ( which if a man doe , he shal liue in them ) and withdrew the shoulder , and hardened their necke , and would not heare .
Yet many yeres diddest thou forbeare them , and testifiedst against them by the Spirit in thy Prophets : yet would they not giue eare : therefore gauest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
Neuerthelesse , for thy great mercies sake , thou diddest not vtterly consume them , nor forsake them ; for thou art a gracious and mercifull God .
Now therefore , our God , the great , the mightie , and the terrible God , who keepest couenant and mercie : let not all the trouble seeme little before thee , that hath come vpon vs , on our Kings , on our Princes , & on our Priests , and on our Prophets , & on our fathers , & on al thy people , since the time of the Kings of Assyria , vnto this day .
Howbeit , thou art iust in all that is brought vpon vs , for thou hast done right , but we haue done wickedly :
Neither haue our kings , our Princes , our Priests , nor our fathers kept thy Law , nor hearkened vnto thy Commandements , and thy Testimonies , wherewith thou didst testifie against them .
For they haue not serued thee in their kingdome , and in thy great goodnesse that thou gauest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gauest before them , neither turned they from their wicked workes .
Behold , we are seruants this day ; and for the land that thou gauest vnto our fathers , to eat the fruit thereof , and the good thereof , behold , wee are seruants in it .
And it yeeldeth much increase vnto the kings , whom thou hast set ouer vs , because of our sinnes : also they haue dominion ouer our bodies , and ouer our cattell , at their pleasure ; and wee are in great distresse .

Also Bakbukiah , and Unni ; their brethren , were ouer against them in the watches .
¶ And Ieshua begate Ioiakim , Ioiakim also begate Eliashib , and Eliashib begate Ioiada ,
And Ioiada begate Ionathan , and Ionathan begate Iaddua .
And in the dayes of Ioiakim , were Priests the chiefe of the fathers : of Seraiah , Meraiah : of Ieremiah , Hananiah :

¶ The Leuites in the dayes of Eliashib , Ioiada , and Iohanan , and Iaddua , were recorded chiefe of the fathers : also the Priests , to the reigne of Darius the Persian .
The sonnes of Leui , the chiefe of the fathers , were written in the booke of the Chronicles , euen vntill the dayes of Iohanan the sonne of Eliashib .
And the chiefe of the Leuites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Ieshua the sonne of Kadmiel , with their brethren ouer against them , to praise and to giue thankes , according to the commandement of Dauid the man of God , ward ouer against ward .
Mattaniah , and Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , Akkub , were porters keeping the ward , at the thresholds of the gates .
These were in the dayes of Ioiakim , the sonne of Ieshua , the sonne of Iozadak , and in the dayes of Nehemiah the gouernour , and of Ezra the Priest , the Scribe .
Also from the house of Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba , and Azmaueth : for the Singers had builded them villages round about Ierusalem .
And the Priests and the Leuites purified themselues , and purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
Then I brought vp the princes of Iudah vpon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gaue thankes , whereof one went on the right hand vpon the wall toward the dounggate :
And after them went Hoshaiah , and halfe of the Princes of Iudah , And Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam ,
Iudah , and Beniamin , and Shemaiah , and Ieremiah ,
And certaine of the Priests sonnes with trumpets : namely , Zechariah the sonne of Ionathan , the sonne of Shemaiah , the sonne of Mattaniah , the sonne of Michaiah , the sonne of Zaccur , the sonne of Asaph :
And his brethren , Shemaiah , and Asarael , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanael , and Iudah , Hanani , with the musicall instruments of Dauid the man of God ; and Ezra the Scribe before them .
And at the fountaine - gate , which was ouer against them , they went vp by the staires of the citie of Dauid , at the going vp of the wall , aboue the house of Dauid , euen vnto the water - gate , Eastward .
And the other company of them that gaue thankes , went ouer against them , and I after them , and the halfe of the people vpon the wall , from beyond the towre of the fornaces , euen vnto the broad wall ,
And from aboue the gate of Ephraim , and aboue the olde gate , and aboue the fish - gate , and the towre of Hananeel , and the towre of Meah , euen vnto the sheepegate ; and they stood still in the prison gate .
So stood the two companies of them that gaue thankes in the house of God , and I , and the halfe of the rulers with me :
And the Priests : Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Michaiah , Elioenai , Zachariah , and Hananiah with trumpets :
And Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Iehohanan , and Malchiiah , and Elam , and Ezer . And the Singers sang loud , with Iezrahiah their ouerseer .
Also that day they offered great sacrifices , and reioyced ; for God had made them reioyce with great ioy : the wiues also and the children reioyced : so that the ioy of Ierusalem was heard euen afarre off .
¶ And at that time were some appointed ouer the chambers for the treasures , for the offerings , for the first fruits , and for the tithes , to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Leuites : for Iudah reioyced for the Priests , & for the Leuites that waited .
And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God , and the ward of the purification , according to the commandement of Dauid , and of Solomon his sonne .
For in the dayes of Dauid and Asaph of old , there were chiefe of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiuing vnto God .
<NON-VERSE>
On that day they read in the booke of Moses in the audience of the people , and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the Congregation of God for euer ,
Because they met not the children of Israel with bread , and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing .
Now it came to passe when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
¶ And before this Eliashib the priest hauing the ouersight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied vnto Tobiah :
And hee had prepared for him a great chamber , where aforetime they laid the meat offrings , the frankincense and the vessels , and the tithes of the corne , the new wine , and the oile , which was commanded to be giuen to the Leuites , and the singers , and the porters , and the offerings of the priests .
But in all this time was not I at Ierusalem : for in the two and thirtieth yeere of Artaxerxes king of Babylon , came I vnto the king , and after certaine dayes , obtained I leaue of the King :
And I came to Ierusalem , and vnderstood of the euil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
And it grieued me sore , therefore I cast foorth all the houshold stuffe of Tobiah out of the chamber :
Then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers , and thither brought I againe the vessels of the house of God , with the meate offering , and the frankincense .
¶ And I perceiued that the portions of the Leuites had not beene giuen them : for the Leuites and the singers that did the worke , were fled euery one to his field .
Then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ? And I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
Then brought all Iudah the tithe of the corne , and the new wine , and the oyle , vnto the treasuries .
And I made treasurers ouer the treasuries , Shelemiah the priest , and Zadok the scribe , and of the Leuites , Pedaiah : and next to them was Hanan the sonne of Zaccur , the sonne of Mattaniah : for they were counted faithfull , and their office was to distribute vnto their brethren .
Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds , that I haue done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
¶ In those dayes sawe I in Iudah , some treading wine presses on the Sabbath , and bringing in sheaues , and lading asses , as also wine , grapes , and figs , and all maner of burdens , which they brought into Ierusalem on the Sabbath day : and I testified against them in the day wherein they solde victuals .
There dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish and all maner of ware , and solde on the Sabbath vnto the children of Iudah , and in Ierusalem .
Then I contended with the Nobles of Iudah , and sayd vnto them , What euill thing is this that ye doe , and profane the Sabbath day ?
Did not your fathers thus , and did not our God bring all this euill vpon vs , and vpon this citie ? yet ye bring more wrath vpon Israel , by profaning the Sabbath .
And it came to passe , that when the gates of Ierusalem beganne to be darke before the Sabbath , I commanded that the gates should be shut , and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath : and some of my seruants set I at the gates , that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day .
So the merchants , and sellers of all kinde of ware , lodged without Ierusalem once or twice .
Then I testified against them , and said vnto them , Why lodge yee about the wall ? If ye doe so againe , I will lay hands on you . From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath .
And I commanded the Leuites , that they should cleanse themselues , and that they should come and keepe the gates , to sanctifie the Sabbath day : Remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me , according to the greatnesse of thy mercie .
¶ In those dayes also sawe I Iewes that had maried wiues of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab :
And their children spake halfe in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speake in the Iewes language , but according to the language of ech people .
And I contended with them , and cursed them , and smote certeine of them , and pluckt off their haire , and made them sweare by God , saying , Yee shall not giue your daughters vnto their sonnes , nor take their daughters vnto your sonnes , or for your selues .
Did not Solomon king of Israel sinne by these things ? yet among many nations was there no king like him , who was beloued of his God , and God made him king ouer all Israel : neuerthelesse , euen him did outlandish women cause to sinne .
Shall wee then hearken vnto you , to doe all this great euill , to transgresse against our God , in marrying strange wiues ?
And one of the sonnes of Ioiada , the sonne of Eliashib the high Priest , was sonne in law to Sanballat the Horonite : therfore I chased him from me .
Remember them , O my God , because they haue defiled the Priesthood , and the couenant of the Priesthood , and of the Leuites .
Thus cleansed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the Priests and the Leuites , euery one in his businesse :

And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the wildernesse of Sinai , in the Tabernacle of the Congregation , on the first day of the second moneth , in the second yeere , after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying , Take yee the summe of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , after their families , by the house of their fathers , with the number of their names , euery male by their polle :
From twentie yeeres old and vpward , all that are able to goe foorth to warre in Israel : thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies .
And with you there shalbe a man of euery Tribe : euery one head of the house of his fathers .

Those that were numbred of them , euen of the tribe of Naphtali , were fiftie and three thousand , and foure hundred . These are those that were numbred , which Moses and Aaron numbred , and the Princes of Israel , being twelue men : each one was for the house of his fathers .

But thou shalt appoint the Leuites ouer the Tabernacle of Testimonie , and ouer all the vessels thereof , and ouer all things that belong to it : they shall beare the Tabernacle , and all the vessels thereof , and they shall minister vnto it , and shall encampe round about the Tabernacle .
And when the Tabernacle setteth forward , the Leuites shall take it downe : and when the Tabernacle is to be pitched , the Leuites shall set it vp : and the stranger that commeth nigh , shall be put to death .
And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents euery man by his own campe , and euery man by his owne standerd , throughout their hostes .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Commaund the children of Israel , that they put out of the campe euery leper , and euery one that hath an issue , and whosoeuer is defiled by the dead :
Both male and female shal ye put out , without the campe shall yee put them , that they defile not their campes in the middest whereof I dwell .

¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men commit , to doe a trespasse against the Lord , and that person be guiltie ;
Then they shall confesse their sinne , which they haue done : and hee shall recompense his trespasse , with the principall thereof , and adde vnto it the fifth part thereof , and giue it vnto him against whom he hath trespassed .
But if the man haue no kinsman to recompense the trespasse vnto , let the trespasse be recompensed vnto the Lord , euen to the Priest : beside the ramme of the atonement , whereby an atonement shall be made for him .
And euery offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring vnto the Priest , shall be his .
And euery mans halowed things shall be his : whatsoeuer any man giueth the Priest , it shall be his .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,

And a man lye with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and there be no witnesse against her , neither she be taken with the maner ;
And the spirit of ielousie come vpon him , and he be ielous of his wife , and shee be defiled : or if the spirit of ielousie come vpon him , and hee be ielous of his wife , and she be not defiled :
Then shall the man bring his wife vnto the Priest , and he shall bring her offering for her , the tenth part of an Ephah of barley meale : hee shall powre no oyle vpon it , nor put frankincense thereon ; for it is an offering of ielousie , an offering of memoriall , bringing iniquitie to remembrance :
And the Priest shall bring her neere , and set her before the Lord .
And the Priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessell , and of the dust that is in the floore of the Tabernacle the Priest shall take , and put it into the water :
And the Priest shall set the woman before the Lord , and vncouer the womans head , and put the offering of memoriall in her hands , which is the Ielousie offering : and the Priest shall haue in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse .
And the Priest shall charge her by an othe , and say vnto the woman , If no man haue lyen with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to vncleannesse with another in stead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse .
But if thou hast gone aside to another in stead of thy husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man hath lien with thee beside thine husband :
Then the Priest shall charge the woman with an othe of cursing , and the Priest shall say vnto the woman , The Lord make thee a curse , and an othe among thy people , when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot , and thy belly to swell .
And this water that causeth the curse , shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , Amen , Amen .
And the Priest shall write these curses in a booke , and hee shall blot them out with the bitter water :
And he shall cause the woman to drinke the bitter water , that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
Then the Priest shall take the ielousie offering out of the womans hand , and shall waue the offering before the Lord , and offer it vpon the Altar .
And the Priest shal take an handfull of the offering , euen the memoriall thereof , and burne it vpon the Altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drinke the water .
And when he hath made her to drinke the water , then it shall come to passe , that if shee be defiled , and haue done trespasse against her husband , that the water that causeth the curse , shall enter into her , and become bitter , and her belly shall swell , and her thigh shal rot : and the woman shalbe a curse among her people .
And if the woman be not defiled , but be cleane , then she shall be free , and shall conceiue seed .
This is the law of ielousies , when a wife goeth aside to another in stead of her husband , and is defiled :
Or when the spirit of ielousie commeth vpon him , and hee be ielous ouer his wife , and shall set the woman before the Lord , and the Priest shal execute vpon her all this law .

Hee shall separate himselfe from wine , and strong drinke , and shal drinke no vineger of wine , or vineger of strong drinke , neither shal he drinke any liquor of grapes , nor eate moist grapes , or dried .
All the dayes of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels euen to the huske .
All the dayes of the vow of his separation , there shall no rasour come vpon his head : vntill the dayes bee fulfilled in the which hee separateth himselfe vnto the Lord , he shall be holy , and shall let the lockes of the haire of his head grow .
All the dayes that he separateth himselfe vnto the Lord , hee shall come at no dead body .
Hee shall not make himselfe vncleane for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consecration of his God is vpon his head .
All the dayes of his separation he is holy vnto the Lord .
And if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration , then he shall shaue his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seuenth day shall he shaue it .
And on the eight day he shal bring two turtles or two yong pigeons to the Priest , to the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation .
And the Priest shall offer the one for a sinne offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that hee sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
And hee shall consecrate vnto the Lord the dayes of his separation , and shall bring a lambe of the first yeere for a trespasse offering : but the dayes that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
¶ And this is the Lawe of the Nazarite : when the dayes of his separation are fulfilled , he shall be brought vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation .
And he shall offer his offring vnto the Lord , one hee lambe of the first yeere without blemish , for a burnt offering , and one ewe lambe of the first yeere without blemish , for a sinne offering , and one lambe without blemish for peace offerings ,
And a basket of vnleauened bread , cakes of fine flowre mingled with oyle , and wafers of vnleauened bread anointed with oyle , and their meate offering , and their drinke offerings .
And the Priest shall bring them before the Lord , and shall offer his sinne offering , and his burnt offering .
And he shall offer the ramme for a sacrifice of peace offerings vnto the Lord , with the basket of vnleauened bread : the Priest shall offer also his meate offering , and his drinke offering .
And the Nazarite shal shaue the head of his separation , at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall take the haire of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is vnder the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
And the Priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ramme , and one vnleauened cake out of the basket , and one vnleauened wafer , and shall put them vpon the hands of the Nazarite , after the haire of his separation is shauen .
And the Priest shall waue them for a waue offring before the Lord : this is holy for the Priest , with the waue breast , and heaue shoulder : and after that , the Nazarite may drinke wine .
This is the Law of the Nazarite , who hath vowed , and of his offering vnto the Lord for his separation , besides that , that his hand shall get : according to the vow which he vowed , so he must do after the law of his separation .

And this worke of the candlestick was of beaten gold , vnto the shaft thereof , vnto the flowres thereof was beaten worke : according vnto the paterne which the Lord had shewed Moses , so he made the candlesticke .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Take the Leuites from among the children of Israel , and cleanse them .
And thus shalt thou doe vnto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle water of purifying vpon them , and let them shaue all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselues cleane .
Then let them take a yong bullocke with his meat offering , euen fine flowre mingled with oyle , and an other yong bullock shalt thou take for a sinne offering .
And thou shalt bring the Leuites before the Tabernacle of the Congregation ; and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together .
And thou shalt bring the Leuites before the Lord , and the children of Israel shall put their hands vpon the Leuites .
And Aaron shall offer the Leuites before the Lord for an offring of the children of Israel , that they may execute the seruice of the Lord .
And the Leuites shall lay their hands vpon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sinne offering , and the other for a burnt offering vnto the Lord , to make an atonement for the Leuites .
And thou shalt set the Leuites before Aaron , and before his sonnes , and offer them for an offering vnto the Lord .
Thus shalt thou separate the Leuites from among the children of Israel : and the Leuites shalbe mine .
And after that , shall the Leuites goe in ; to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation : and thou shalt clense them , and offer them for an offering .
For they are wholly giuen vnto me , from among the children of Israel : in stead of such as open euery wombe , euen in stead of the first borne of all the children of Israel , haue I taken them vnto me .
For all the first borne of the children of Israel , are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smote euery first borne in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for my selfe .
And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel .
And I haue giuen the Leuites as a gift to Aaron , and to his sonnes , from among the children of Israel , to do the seruice of the children of Israel , in the Tabernacle of the Congregation , and to make an atonement for the children of Israel : that there bee no plague among the children of Israel , when the children of Israel come nigh vnto the Sanctuarie .

And the Leuites were purified , and they washed their clothes : and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord , and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them .

And Moses spake vnto the children of Israel that they should keepe the Passeouer .
And they kept the Passeouer on the fourteenth day of the first moneth at Euen , in the wildernesse of Sinai : according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did the children of Israel .
¶ And there were certaine men who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keepe the Passeouer on that day : and they came before Moses , and before Aaron on that day .
And those men said vnto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept backe , that wee may not offer an offring of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
And Moses saide vnto them , Stand still , and I will heare what the Lord wil command concerning you .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , saying , If any man of you , or of your posteritie shall be vncleane by reason of a dead body , or bee in a iourney afarre off , yet he shall keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord .
The fourteenth day of the second moneth at Euen they shall keepe it , and eat it with vnleauened bread and bitter herbes .
They shall leaue none of it vnto the morning , nor breake any bone of it : according to all the ordinances of the Passeouer they shall keepe it .
But the man that is cleane , and is not in a iourney , and forbeareth to keep the Passeouer , euen the same soule shall be cut off from his people , because hee brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season : that man shall beare his sinne .
And if a stranger shall soiourne among you , and will keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord ; according to the ordinance of the Passeouer , and according to the maner thereof , so shall he doe : ye shall haue one ordinance , both for the stranger , and for him that was borne in the land .
¶ And on the day that the Tabernacle was reared vp , the cloud couered the Tabernacle , namely the Tent of the Testimony : and at Euen there was vpon the Tabernacle , as it were the appearance of fire , vntill the morning .
So it was always : the cloud couered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
And when the cloud was taken vp from the Tabernacle , then after that , the children of Israel iourneyed , and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
At the commandement of the Lord the children of Israel iourneied , and at the commandement of the Lord they pitched : as long as the cloud abode vpon the Tabernacle , they rested in the tents .
And when the cloud taried long vpon the Tabernacle many daies , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord , and iourneyed not .
And so it was when the cloude was a few daies vpon the Tabernacle , according to the commandement of the Lord , they abode in their tents , and according to the commandement of the Lord , they iourneyed .
And so it was when the cloude abode from Euen vnto the morning , and that the cloude was taken vp in the morning , then they iourneyed : whether it was by day or by night that the cloude was taken vp , they iourneyed .
Or whether it were two dayes , or a moneth , or a yeere that the cloude taried vpon the Tabernacle , remayning thereon , the children of Israel abode in their tents , and iourneyed not : but when it was taken vp , they iourneyed .

And if they blow but with one trumpet , then the Princes , which are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselues vnto thee .
When ye blow an alarme , then the campes that lie on the East parts , shall goe forward .
When you blow an alarme the second time , then the campes that lye on the Southside , shall take their iourney : they shall blow an alarme for their iourneys .
But when the Congregation is to be gathered together , you shal blow : but you shall not sound an alarme .
And the sonnes of Aaron the Priests shall blow with the trumpets ; and they shalbe to you for an ordinance for euer throughout your generations .
And if ye goe to warre in your land , against the enemie that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarme with the trumpets , and ye shalbe remembred before the Lord your God , and yee shalbe saued from your enemies .
Also in the day of your gladnesse , and in your solemne dayes , and in the beginnings of your monethes , ye shall blow with the trumpets ouer your burnt offerings , and ouer the sacrifices of your peace offerings , that they may bee to you for a memoriall before your God : I am the Lord your God .

We remember the fish which wee did eate in Egypt freely : the cucumbers and the melons , and the leekes , and the onions , and the garlicke .
But now our soule is dried away , there is nothing at all , besides this Manna , before our eyes .
And the Manna was as Coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of Bdelium :
And the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in milles , or beat it in a morter , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oyle .
And when the dew fell vpon the campe in the night , the Manna fell vpon it .
¶ Then Moses heard the people weepe throughout their families , euery man in the doore of his tent , and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly , Moses also was displeased .
And Moses said vnto the Lord , Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy seruant ? and wherefore haue I not found fauour in thy sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people vpon me ?
Haue I conceiued all this people ? haue I begotten them , that thou shouldest say vnto me , Cary them in thy bosome ( as a nursing father beareth the sucking child ) vnto the land which thou swarest vnto their fathers ?
Whence should I haue flesh to giue vnto all this people ? for they weep vnto me , saying , Giue vs flesh , that we may eate .
I am not able to beare all this people alone , because it is too heauie for mee .
And if thou deale thus with mee , kill me , I pray thee out of hand , if I haue found fauour in thy sight , and let me not see my wretchednesse .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , Gather vnto me seuentie men , of the Elders of Israel , whome thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers ouer them : and bring them vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
And I will come downe and talke with thee there , and I will take of the spirit which is vpon thee , and wil put it vpon them , and they shall beare the burden of the people with thee , that thou beare it not thy selfe alone .
And say thou vnto the people , Sanctifie your selues against to morrow , and yee shall eate flesh : ( for you haue wept in the eares of the Lord , saying , Who shall giue vs flesh to eate ? for it was well with vs in Egypt : ) therfore the Lord wil giue you flesh , and ye shall eate .
Ye shall not eate one day , nor two dayes , nor fiue dayes , neither ten dayes , nor twentie dayes :
But euen a whole moneth , vntill it come out at your nostrels , and it bee loathsome vnto you , because that yee haue despised the Lord which is among you , and haue wept before him , saying , Why came we foorth out of Egypt ?
And Moses said , The people amongst whome I am , are sixe hundred thousand footmen , and thou hast said , I will giue them flesh , that they may eate a whole moneth .
Shall the flockes and the herds be slaine for them to suffice them ? or shal all the fish of the sea bee gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Is the Lords hand waxed short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to passe vnto thee , or not .

And the Lord came downe in a cloude , and spake vnto him , and tooke of the spirit that was vpon him , and gaue it vnto the seuentie Elders : and it came to passe that when the spirit rested vpon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
But there remained two of the men in the campe , the name of the one was Eldad , & the name of the other Medad : and the Spirit rested vpon them , ( and they were of them that were written , but went not out vnto the Tabernacle ) and they prophesied in the campe .
And there ranne a yong man , and tolde Moses , and said , Eldad and Medad doe prophesie in the campe .
And Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of Moses , one of his yong men , answered and said , My lord Moses , Forbid them .
And Moses said vnto him , Enuiest thou for my sake ? Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets , and that the Lord would put his Spirit vpon them .
And Moses gate him into the campe , he , and the Elders of Israel .
¶ And there went forth a winde from the Lord , and brought quailes from the sea , and let them fall by the campe , as it were a dayes iourney on this side , and as it were a dayes iourney on the other side round about the campe , and as it were two cubits high vpon the face of the earth .
And the people stood vp all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quailes : he that gathered least , gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselues round about the campe .
And while the flesh was yet betweene their teeth , yer it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague .
And he called the name of that place , Kibroth - Hattaauah : because there they buried the people that lusted .

And the Lord came downe in the pillar of the cloude , and stood in the doore of the Tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came foorth .
And hee saide , Heare now my words : If there be a Prophet among you , I the Lord will make my selfe knowen vnto him in a vision , and will speake vnto him in a dreame :
My seruant Moses is not so , who is faithfull in all mine house .
With him will I speake mouth to mouth euen apparantly , and not in darke speeches , and the similitude of the Lord shall hee behold : wherefore then were yee not afraid to speake against my seruant Moses ?
And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them , and he departed .
And the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle , and behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow : and Aaron looked vpon Miriam , and behold , she was leprous .
And Aaron said vnto Moses , Alas my lord , I beseech thee , lay not the sinne vpon vs , wherein we haue done foolishly , and wherein we haue sinned :
Let her not bee as one dead , of whom the flesh is halfe consumed , when he commeth out of his mothers wombe .
And Moses cryed vnto the Lord , saying , Heale her now , O God , I beseech thee .

Send thou men , that they may search the lande of Canaan , which I giue vnto the children of Israel : of euery tribe of their fathers shal ye send a man , euery one a ruler among them .
And Moses by the commaundement of the Lord , sent them from the wildernes of Paran : all those men were heads of the children of Israel .
And these were their names . Of the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the sonne of Zaccur .
Of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the sonne of Hori .
Of the tribe of Ephraim , Oshea the sonne of Nun . Of the tribe of Beniamin , Palti the sonne of Raphu .
Of the tribe of Zebulun , Gaddiel the sonne of Sodi .
Of the tribe of Ioseph , namely of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the sonne of Susi . Of the tribe of Dan , Ammiel the sonne of Gemalli .
Of the tribe of Asher , Sethur the sonne of Michael . Of the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi the sonne of Uophsi .
Of the tribe of Gad , Geuel the sonne of Machi .
These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spie out the land : and Moses called Oshea the sonne of Nun , Iehoshua .
¶ And Moses sent them to spie out the land of Canaan , and said vnto them , Get you by this way Southward , and goe vp into the mountaine :
And see the lande what it is , and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they bee strong or weake , fewe or many :
And what the lande is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad , and what cities they bee that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds :
And what the land is , whether it be fat or leane , whether there be wood therein , or not . And be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land : ( Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes )
¶ So they went vp , and searched the land , from the wildernesse of Zin , vnto Rehob , as men come to Hamath .
And they ascended by the South , and came vnto Hebron : where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak were : Now Hebron was built seuen yeeres before Zoan in Egypt .
And they came vnto the brooke of Eshcol , and cut downe from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it betweene two vpon a staffe , and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs .
The place was called the brooke Eshcol , because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut downe from thence .
And they returned from searching of the land after fourty dayes .
¶ And they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel vnto the wildernesse of Paran , to Kadesh , and brought backe word vnto them , and vnto all the Congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
And they told him , and said , We came vnto the land whither thou sentest vs , & surely it floweth with milke and honie ; and this is the fruit of it .
Neuerthelesse , the people bee strong that dwell in the land , and the cities are walled and very great : and moreouer , we saw the children of Anak there .
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South : and the Hittites , and the Iebusites , and the Amorites dwell in the mountaines : and the Canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of Iordane .
And Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , Let vs goe vp at once , and possesse it , for we are well able to ouercome it .
But the men that went vp with him , said , Wee be not able to goe vp against the people , for they are stronger then we .
And they brought vp an euill report of the land which they had searched , vnto the children of Israel , saying , The land through which we haue gone , to search it , is a land that eateth vp the inhabitants thereof , and all the people that we saw in it , are men of a great stature .
<NON-VERSE>
And all the Congregation lifted vp their voyce and cried ; and the people wept that night .
And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses , and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said vnto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt , or would God we had died in this wildernesse .
And wherefore hath the Lord brought vs vnto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wiues , and our children should be a pray ? Were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt ?
And they saide one to another , Let vs make a captaine , and let vs returne into Egypt .
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Congregation of the children of Israel .
¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes .
And they spake vnto all the company of the children of Israel , saying . The land which wee passed thorow to search it , is an exceeding good land .
If the Lord delight in vs , then he will bring vs into this land , and giue it vs , a land which floweth with milke and hony .
Onely rebell not yee against the Lord , neither feare yee the people of the land , for they are bread for vs : their defence is departed from them , and the Lord is with vs : feare them not .
But all the Congregation bade stone them with stones : and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation , before all the children of Israel .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it bee , yer they beleeue me , for all the signes which I haue shewed among them ?
I will smite them with the pestilence , and disinherite them , and will make of thee a greater nation , and mightier then they .
¶ And Moses said vnto the Lord , Then the Egyptians shall heare it , ( for thou broughtest vp this people in thy might from among them : )
And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land : for they haue heard that thou Lord art among this people , that thou Lord art seene face to face , and that thy cloud standeth ouer them , and that thou goest before them , by day time in a pillar of a cloud , and in a pillar of fire by night .
¶ Now if thou shalt kill all this people , as one man , then the nations which haue heard the fame of thee , will speake , saying ,
Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the lande which he sware vnto them , therefore he hath slaine them in the wildernesse .
And now , I beseech thee , let the power of my Lord be great , according as thou hast spoken , saying ,
The Lord is long suffering , and of great mercie , forgiuing iniquitie and transgression , and by no meanes clearing the guiltie , visiting the iniquity of the fathers vpon the chldren , vnto the third and fourth generation .
Pardon , I beseech thee , the iniquitie of this people , according vnto the greatnesse of thy mercie , and as thou hast forgiuen this people , from Egypt , euen vntill now .
And the Lord said , I haue pardoned , according to thy word .
But as truly as I liue , all the earth shalbe filled with the glory of the Lord .
Because all those men which haue seene my glory , and my miracles which I did in Egypt , and in the wildernesse , and haue tempted mee now these ten times , and haue not hearkened to my voice ,
Surely they shall not see the land which I sware vnto their fathers , neither shall any of them that prouoked me , see it .
But my seruant Caleb , because hee had another spirit with him , ( and hath followed mee fully ) him will I bring into the land , whereinto he went , and his seed shall possesse it .
( Now the Amalekites , and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley ) to morrow turne you and get you into the wildernesse , by the way of the Red sea .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , and vnto Aaron , saying ,
How long shall I beare with this euil congregation which murmure against mee ? I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmure against mee .
Say vnto them , As truly as I liue , saith the Lord , as ye haue spoken in mine eares , so will I doe to you :
Your carcases shall fall in this wildernesse , and all that were numbred of you , according to your whole number from twentie yeeres old and vpward , which haue murmured against mee ,
Doubtlesse ye shall not come into the land concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein , saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , and Ioshua the sonne of Nun .
But your little ones , which yee said should be a pray , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye haue despised .
But as for you , your carkases , they shall fall in this wildernesse .
And your children shall wander in the wildernes forty yeres , and beare your whoredomes , vntill your carkases be wasted in the wildernesse .
After the number of the dayes in which ye searched the land , euen fortie dayes ( each day for a yeere ) shall yee beare your iniquities , euen forty yeeres , and yee shall know my breach of promise .
I the Lord haue said , I will surely doe it vnto all this euill Congregation , that are gathered together against mee : in this wildernesse they shalbe consumed , & there they shall die .
And the men which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmure against him , by bringing vp a slander vpon the land ,
Euen those men that did bring vp the euill report vpon the land , died by the plague , before the Lord .
But Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh , which were of the men that went to search the land , liued still .
And Moses told these sayings vnto all the children of Israel , and the people mourned greatly .
¶ And they rose vp early in the morning , and gate them vp into the top of the mountaine , saying , Loe , we be here , and will goe vp vnto the place which the Lord hath promised : for we haue sinned .
And Moses said , Wherefore now doe you transgresse the commaundement of the Lord ? but it shall not prosper .
Goe not vp , for the Lord is not among you , that ye be not smitten before your enemies .
For the Amalekites , and the Canaanites are there before you , and yee shall fall by the sword , because yee are turned away from the Lord ; therefore the Lord will not bee with you .
But they presumed to go vp vnto the hill top : neuertheles the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord , and Moses departed not out of the campe .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , and say vnto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I giue vnto you ,
And will make an offering by fire vnto the Lord , a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a free will offering , or in your solemne feasts , to make a sweet sauour vnto the Lord , of the herd or of the flocke : Then shall he that offereth his offering vnto the Lord , bring a meat offring of a tenth deale of flowre , mingled with the fourth part of an Hyn of oyle .
And the fourth part of an Hyn of wine for a drinke offring shalt thou prepare , with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lambe .
Or for a ramme , thou shalt prepare for a meate offering two tenth deales of flowre mingled with the third part of an Hyn of oyle .
And for a drinke offering , thou shalt offer the third part of an Hyn of wine , for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord .
And when thou preparest a bullocke for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings vnto the Lord :
Then shall hee bring with a bullocke a meate offering of three tenth deales of flowre , mingled with halfe an Hyn of oyle .
And thou shalt bring for a drinke offering halfe an Hyn of wine , for an offering made by fire of a sweet sauour vnto the Lord . Thus shall it be done for one bullocke , or for one ramme , or for a lambe , or a kidde .
According to the number that yee shall prepare , so shall yee doe to euery one , according to their number .
All that are borne of the countrey shall doe these things after this maner , in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet sauour , vnto the Lord .
And if a stranger soiourne with you , or whosoeuer bee among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord : as ye doe , so hee shall doe .
One ordinance shall be both for you of the Congregation , and also for the stranger that soiourneth with you , an ordinance for euer in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger bee , before the Lord .
One law , and one maner shall be for you , and for the stranger that soiourneth with you .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , and say vnto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you ,
Then it shall be that when ye eate of the bread of the land , yee shall offer vp an heaue offring vnto the Lord .
Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dough , for an heaue offring : as ye doe the heaue offering of the threshing floore , so shall ye heaue it .
Euen all that the Lord hath commanded you , by the hand of Moses from the day that the Lord commanded Moses , and henceforward among your generations :
Then it shalbe , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the Congregation , that all the Congregation shall offer one yong bullocke for a burnt offering , for a sweet sauour vnto the Lord , with his meate offering , and his drinke offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sinne offering .
And the Priest shall make an atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and it shal be forgiuen them , for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offring , a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord , and their sinne offering before the Lord , for their ignorance .
And it shall bee forgiuen all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that soiourneth among them , seeing all the people were in ignorance .
¶ And if any soule sinne through ignorance , then hee shall bring a shee goat of the first yeere for a sinne offring .
And the Priest shall make an atonement for the soule that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an atonement for him , & it shalbe forgiuen him .
You shall haue one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is borne amongst the children of Israel , and for the stranger that soiourneth among them .
¶ But the soule that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be borne in the land , or a stranger , the same reprocheth the Lord : and that soule shall be cut off from among his people .
Because he hath despised the word of the Lord , and hath broken his commandement , that soule shall vtterly be cut off : his iniquitie shall be vpon him .
¶ And while the children of Israel were in the wildernes , they found a man that gathered stickes vpon the Sabbath day .
And they that found him gathering sticks , brought him vnto Moses and Aaron , and vnto all the Congregation .
And they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , The man shall bee surely put to death : all the Congregation shall stone him with stones without the campe .
And all the Cogregation brought him without the campe , and stoned him with stones , and he died , as the Lord commanded Moses .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , and bidde them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments , throughout their generations , and that they put vpon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blew .
And it shall bee vnto you for a fringe , that ye may looke vpon it , and remember all the commandements of the Lord , and doe them : and that ye seeke not after your owne heart , and your owne eyes , after which ye vse to goe a whoring :
That ye may remember , and doe all my commandements , and be holy vnto your God .
<NON-VERSE> Now Korah the sonne of Izhar , the sonne of Kohath , the sonne of Leui , and Dathan , and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab , and On the sonne of Peleth , sonnes of Reuben , tooke men .
And they rose vp before Moses , with certaine of the children of Israel , two hundred and fiftie Princes of the assembly , famous in the Congregation , men of renowne .
And they gathered themselues together against Moses , and against Aaron , and said vnto them , Ye take too much vpon you , seeing all the Congregation are holy euery one of them , and the Lord is among them : wherfore then lift you vp your selues aboue the Congregation of the Lord ?
And when Moses heard it , he fell vpon his face .
And hee spake vnto Korah , and vnto all his company , saying , Euen to morrow the Lord will shew who are his , and who is holy , and will cause him to come neere vnto him : euen him whom he hath chosen , will he cause to come neere vnto him .
This doe : take you censers , Korah , and all his company :
And put fire therein , and put incense in them , before the Lord to morrow ; And it shall be , that the man whom the Lord doeth choose , hee shall be holy : yee take too much vpon you , ye sonnes of Leui .
And Moses saide vnto Korah , Heare , I pray you , ye sonnes of Leui .
Seemeth it but a small thing vnto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the Congregation of Israel , to bring you neere to himselfe , to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Lord , and to stand before the Congregation to minister vnto them ?
And he hath brought thee neere to him , and all thy brethren the sonnes of Leui with thee : and seeke ye the Priesthood also ?
For which cause both thou , and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord : and what is Aaron , that ye murmure against him ?
¶ And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab : which said , We will not come vp .
Is it a small thing that thou hast brought vs vp out of a land that floweth with milke and hony , to kill vs in the wildernesse , except thou make thy selfe altogether a prince ouer vs ?
Moreouer , thou hast not brought vs into a land that floweth with milke and hony , or giuen vs inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come vp .
And Moses was very wroth , and said vnto the Lord , Respect not thou their offering : I haue not taken one asse from them , neither haue I hurt one of them .
And Moses said vnto Korah , Be thou and all thy company before the Lord , thou , and they , and Aaron to morrow .
And take euery man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring yee before the Lord euery man his censer , two hundred and fiftie censers , thou also and Aaron , each of you his censer .
And they tooke euery man his censer , and put fire in them , and laide incense thereon , and stood in the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron .
And Korah gathered all the Congregation against them , vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation : and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto all the Congregation .
And the Lord spake vnto Moses , and vnto Aaron , saying ,
Separate your selues from among this Congregation , that I may consume them in a moment .
And they fell vpon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shal one man sinne , and wilt thou be wroth with all the Congregation ?
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the Congregation , saying , Get you vp from about the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram .
And Moses rose vp , and went vnto Dathan and Abiram : and the Elders of Israel followed him .
And hee spake vnto the Congregation , saying , Depart , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sinnes .
So they gate vp from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on euery side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the doore of their tents , and their wiues , & their sonnes , and their little children .
And Moses said , Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to doe all these workes : for I haue not done them of mine owne mind .
If these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the visitation of all men , then the Lord hath not sent me :
But if the Lord make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them vp , with all that appertaine vnto them , and they go downe quicke into the pit : then ye shall vnderstand that these men haue prouoked the Lord .
¶ And it came to passe as he had made an ende of speaking all these words , that the ground claue asunder that was vnder them :
And the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them vp , and their houses , and all the men that appertained vnto Korah , and all their goods .
They , and all that appertained to them , went downe aliue into the pit , and the earth closed vpon them : and they perished from among the Congregation .
And all Israel that were round about them , fled at the crie of them : for they said , Lest the earth swallow vs vp also .
And there came out a fire from the Lord , and consumed the two hundred and fiftie men that offered incense .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest , that he take vp the censers out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder , for they are hallowed .
The censers of these sinners against their owne soules , let them make them broad plates for a couering of the Altar : for they offered them before the Lord , therefore they are hallowed , and they shall be a signe vnto the children of Israel . And Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers , wherewith they that were burnt had offered , and they were made broad plates for a couering of the Altar :
To bee a memoriall vnto the children of Israel , that no stranger , which is not of the seed of Aaron , come neere to offer incense before the Lord , that he be not as Korah , and as his company , as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses .
¶ But on the morrow , all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye haue killed the people of the Lord .
And it came to passe when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation : and behold , the cloud couered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared . And Moses and Aaron came before the Tabernacle of the Congregation .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Get you vp from among this Congregation , that I may consume them , as in a moment : and they fell vpon their faces .
¶ And Moses said vnto Aaron , Take a censer , and put fire therein from off the Altar , and put on incense , and goe quickly vnto the Congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the Lord ; the plague is begun .
And Aaron tooke as Moses commanded , and ranne into the midst of the Congregation : and behold , the plague was begun among the people , and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
And he stood betweene the dead and the liuing , and the plague was stayed .
Now they that died in the plague , were foureteene thousand and seuen hundred , beside them that died about the matter of Korah .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying , Speake vnto the children of Israel , and take of euery one of them a rod , according to the house of their fathers , of all their princes , according to the house of their fathers , twelue rods : write thou euery mans name vpon his rodde .
And thou shalt write Aarons name vpon the rod of Leui : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers .
And thou shalt lay them vp in the Tabernacle of the Congregation , before the Testimony , where I will meet with you .
And it shall come to passe , that the mans rod whom I shall choose , shall blossome : and I will make to cease from mee the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmure against you .
¶ And Moses spake vnto the children of Israel , and euery one of their Princes gaue him a rod a piece , for each Prince one , according to their fathers houses , euen twelue rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
And Moses layd vp the rods before the Lord , in the Tabernacle of Witnesse .
And it came to passe that on the morrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of Witnesse , and behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Leui was budded , and brought forth buds , and bloomed blossomes , and yeelded almonds .
And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord , vnto all the children of Israel : and they looked , and tooke euery man his rod .
¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses , Bring Aarons rod againe before the Testimony , to be kept for a token against the rebels , and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me , that they die not .
And Moses did so : as the Lord commanded him , so did he .
And the children of Israel spake vnto Moses , saying , Behold , wee die , we perish , we all perish .

And the Lord sayd vnto Aaron , Thou and thy sonnes , and thy fathers house with thee , shall beare the iniquitie of the Sanctuary : and thou and thy sonnes with thee , shall beare the iniquitie of your Priesthood .
And thy brethren also of the tribe of Leui , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be ioyned vnto thee , and minister vnto thee : but thou and thy sonnes with thee shall minister before the Tabernacle of Witnesse .
And they shall keepe thy charge , and the charge of all the Tabernacle : onely they shall not come nigh the vessels of the Sanctuarie , and the Altar , that neither they , nor you also die .
And they shall bee ioyned vnto thee , and keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation , for all the seruice of the Tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh vnto you .
And yee shall keepe the charge of the Sanctuary , and the charge of the Altar , that there be no wrath any more vpon the children of Israel .
And I , beholde , I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of Israel : to you they are giuen as a gift for the Lord , to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation .
Therefore thou and thy sonnes with thee , shall keepe your Priests office for euery thing of the Altar , and within the Uaile , and yee shall serue : I haue giuen your Priests office vnto you , as a seruice of gift : and the stranger that commeth nigh , shall bee put to death .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Aaron , Behold , I also haue giuen thee the charge of mine heaue offerings , of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel , vnto thee haue I giuen them by reason of the anointing , and to thy sonnes by an ordinance for euer .
This shall bee thine of the most holy things , reserued from the fire : euery oblation of theirs , euery meat offering of theirs , and euery sinne offering of theirs , and euery trespasse offering of theirs , which they shal render vnto me , shall be most holy for thee , and for thy sonnes .
In the most holy place shalt thou eate it , euery male shall eate it : it shall be holy vnto thee .
And this is thine : the heaue offering of their gift , with all the waue offrings of the children of Israel : I haue giuen them vnto thee , & to thy sonnes , and to thy daughters with thee , by a statute for euer : euery one that is cleane in thy house , shall eate of it .
All the best of the oyle , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the first fruits of them which they shall offer vnto the Lord , them haue I giuen thee .
And whatsoeuer is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring vnto the Lord , shall be thine , euery one that is cleane in thine house , shall eat of it .
Euery thing deuoted in Israel , shall be thine .
Euery thing that openeth the matrice in all flesh , which they bring vnto the Lord , whether it bee of men or beasts , shall be thine : Neuertheles the first borne of man shalt thou surely redeeme , and the firstling of vncleane beasts shalt thou redeeme .
And those that are to be redeemed , from a moneth old shalt thou redeeme according to thine estimation , for the money of fiue shekels , after the shekel of the Sanctuary , which is twentie gerahs .
But the firstling of a cowe , or the firstling of a sheepe , or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeeme , they are holy : thou shalt sprinckle their blood vpon the Altar , and shalt burne their fat for an offering made by fire , for a sweet sauour vnto the Lord .
And the flesh of them shall bee thine : as the waue breast , and as the right shoulder are thine .
All the heaue offerings of the holy things , which the children of Israel offer vnto the Lord , haue I giuen thee and thy sonnes , and thy daughters with thee , by a statute for euer : it is a couenant of salt for euer , before the Lord vnto thee , and to thy seed with thee .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Aaron , Thou shalt haue no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou haue any part among them : I am thy part , and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
And behold , I haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel , for an inheritance , for their seruice which they serue , euen the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation .
Neither must the children of Israel hencefoorth come nigh the Tabernacle of the Congregation , lest they beare sinne , and die .
But the Leuites shall doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation , and they shal beare their iniquitie : it shall be a statute for euer throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they haue no inheritance .
But the tithes of the children of Israel which they offer as an heaue offering vnto the Lord , I haue giuen to the Leuites to inherite : therefore I haue said vnto them , Among the children of Israel they shall haue no inheritance .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Thus speake vnto the Leuites , and say vnto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes , which I haue giuen you from them for your inheritance , then ye shal offer vp an heaue offering of it for the Lord , euen a tenth part of the tithe .
And this your heaue offering shall be reckoned vnto you , as though it were the corne of the threshing floore , and as the fulnesse of the wine presse .
Thus you also shal offer an heaue offering vnto the Lord of all your tithes which ye receiue of the children of Israel , and ye shall giue thereof the Lords heaue offering to Aaron the Priest .
Out of all your gifts ye shall offer euery heaue offering of the Lord , of all the best thereof , euen the hallowed part thereof , out of it .
Therefore thou shalt say vnto them , When yee haue heaued the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted vnto the Leuites , as the encrease of the threshing floore , and as the encrease of the wine presse .
And ye shall eate it in euery place , ye and your housholds : for it is your reward for your seruice , in the Tabernacle of the Congregation .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , and vnto Aaron , saying ,
This is the ordinance of the Law , which the Lord hath commaunded , saying , Speake vnto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and vpon which neuer came yoke .
And ye shall giue her vnto Eleazar the Priest , that hee may bring her forth without the campe , and one shall slay her before his face .
And Eleazar the Priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinckle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen times .
And one shall burne the heifer in his sight : her skinne , and her flesh , and her blood , with her doung , shall he burne .
And the Priest shall take Cedarwood , and hysope , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
Then the Priest shall wash his clothes , and hee shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the campe , and the Priest shalbe vncleane vntill the euen .
And he that burneth her , shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be vncleane vntill the Euen .
And a man that is cleane , shall gather vp the ashes of the heifer , and lay them vp without the campe in a cleane place , and it shall bee kept for the Congregation of the children of Israel , for a water of separation : it is a purification for sinne .
And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer , shall wash his clothes , and be vncleane vntil the Euen : and it shall be vnto the children of Israel , and vnto the stranger that soiourneth among them , for a statute for euer .
¶ He that toucheth the dead body of any man , shall bee vncleane seuen dayes .
He shall purifie himselfe with it on the third day , and on the seuenth day he shall be cleane : but if he purifie not himselfe the third day , then the seuenth day he shall not be cleane .
Whosoeuer toucheth the dead bodie of any man that is dead , and purifieth not himselfe , defileth the Tabernacle of the Lord , and that soule shall be cut off from Israel , because the water of separation was not sprinckled vpon him : he shall be vncleane , his vncleannesse is yet vpon him .
This is the law , when a man dieth in a tent ; all that come into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shalbe vnclean seuen dayes .
And euery open vessel which hath no couering bound vpon it , is vncleane .
And whosoeuer toucheth one that is slaine with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a graue , shall be vncleane seuen dayes .
And for an vncleane person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sinne , and running water shall bee put thereto in a vessell :
And a cleane person shall take hysope , and dippe it in the water , and sprinckle it vpon the tent , and vpon all the vessels , and vpon the persons that were there , and vpon him that touched a bone , or one slaine , or one dead , or a graue .
And the cleane person shal sprinkle vpon the vncleane on the third day , and on the seuenth day : and on the seuenth day he shall purifie himselfe , and wash his clothes , and bathe himselfe in water , and shall be cleane at Euen .
But the man that shall bee vncleane , and shall not purifie himselfe , that soule shall bee cut off from among the Congregation : because he hath defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord , the water of separation hath not beene sprinkled vpon him , he is vncleane .
And it shall be a perpetuall statute vnto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation , shall wash his clothes : and he that toucheth the water of separation , shall be vncleane vntill Euen .

Then came the children of Israel , euen the whole Congregation , into the desert of Zin , in the first moneth : and the people abode in Kadesh , and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
And there was no water for the Congregation : and they gathered themselues together against Moses and against Aaron .
And the people chode with Moses , and spake , saying , Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord .
And why haue yee brought vp the Congregation of the Lord into this wildernesse , that we and our cattell should die there ?
And wherefore haue ye made vs to come vp out of Egypt , to bring vs in vnto this euil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figges , or vines , or of pomegranates , neither is there any water to drinke .
And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly , vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the congregation , and they fell vpon their faces : and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto them .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Take the rodde , and gather thou the assembly together , thou and Aaron thy brother , and speake yee vnto the rocke before their eyes , and it shall giue foorth his water , and thou shalt bring foorth to them , water out of the rocke : so thou shalt giue the Congregation , and their beasts drinke .
And Moses tooke the rod from before the Lord , as he commanded him .
And Moses and Aaron gathered the Congregation together before the rocke , and hee said vnto them , Heare now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rocke ?
And Moses lift vp his hand , and with his rod he smote the rocke twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the Congregation dranke , and their beasts also .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron , Because ye beleeue me not , to sanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I haue giuen them .
This is the water of Meribah , because the children of Israel stroue with the Lord ; and he was sanctified in them .
¶ And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh , vnto the King of Edom ; Thus saith thy brother Israel , Thou knowest all the trauaile that hath befallen vs :
How our fathers went downe into Egypt , and we haue dwelt in Egypt a long time : and the Egyptians vexed vs , and our fathers .
And when wee cryed vnto the Lord , he heard our voyce , and sent an Angel , and hath brought vs foorth out of Egypt : and behold , wee are in Kadesh , a citie in the vttermost of thy border .
Let vs passe , I pray thee , thorow thy countrey : we will not passe thorow the fields , or thorow the Uineyards , neither will we drinke of the water of the wells : wee will goe by the Kings high - way , we wil not turne to the right hand nor to the left , vntill wee haue passed thy borders .
And Edom said vnto him , Thou shalt not passe by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
And the children of Israel said vnto him , We will goe by the high - way : and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water , then I will pay for it : I will onely ( without doing any thing else ) go thorow on my feet .
And he said , Thou shalt not goe thorow . And Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
Thus Edom refused to giue Israel passage thorow his border : wherefore Israel turned away from him .
¶ And the children of Israel , euen the whole Congregation , iourneyed from Kadesh , and came vnto mount Hor .
And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ;
Aaron shall bee gathered vnto his people : for hee shall not enter into the land which I haue giuen vnto the children of Israel , because yee rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
Take Aaron , and Eleazar his sonne , and bring them vp vnto mount Hor .
And strippe Aaron of his garments , and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne , and Aaron shall be gathered vnto his people , and shall die there .
And Moses did as the Lord commaunded : and they went vp into mount Hor , in the sight of all the Congregation .
And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne , and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and Moses and Eleazar came downe from the mount .

And when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies , then hee fought against Israel , and tooke some of them prisoners .
And Israel vowed a vow vnto the Lord , and said , If thou wilt in deed deliuer this people into my hand , then I wil vtterly destroy their cities .
And the Lord hearkened to the voyce of Israel , and deliuered vp the Canaanites : and they vtterly destroyed them , and their cities , and hee called the name of the place Hormah .
¶ And they iourneyed from mount Hor , by the way of the red sea , to compasse the land of Edom : and the soule of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
And the people spake against God and against Moses , Wherefore haue ye brought vs vp out of Egypt , to die in the wildernesse ? for there is no bread , neither is there any water , and our soule loatheth this light bread .
And the Lord sent fierie serpents among the people , and they bit the people , and much people of Israel died .
¶ Therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We haue sinned : for wee haue spoken against the Lord , and against thee : pray vnto the Lord that hee take away the serpents from vs : and Moses prayed for the people .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Make thee a fierie serpent , and set it vpon a pole : and it shall come to passe , that euery one that is bitten , when hee looketh vpon it , shall liue .
And Moses made a serpent of brasse , and put it vpon a pole , and it came to passe , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when hee beheld the serpent of brasse , he liued .
¶ And the children of Israel set forward , and pitched in Oboth .
And they iourneyed from Oboth , and pitched at Iie - Abarim , in the wildernes which is before Moab , toward the Sunne rising .
¶ From thence they remooued , and pitched in the valley of Zared .
From thence they remooued , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wildernesse that commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , betweene Moab and the Amorites .
Wherefore it is said in the booke of the warres of the Lord , what he did in the Red sea , and in the brookes of Arnon ,
And at the streame of the brookes that goeth downe to the dwelling of Ar , & lieth vpon the border of Moab .
And from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the Lord spake vnto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will giue them water .
¶ Then Israel sang this song , Spring vp O well , Sing ye vnto it :
The Princes digged the well , the nobles of the people digged it , by the direction of the Law - giuer , with their staues . And from the wildernesse they went to Mattanah :
And from Mattanah , to Nahaliel , and from Nahaliel to Bamoth :
And from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the countrey of Moab , to the toppe of Pisgah , which looketh toward Ieshimon .
¶ And Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon king of the Amorites , saying ,
Let me passe thorow thy land , we will not turne into the fields , or into the vineyards , we will not drinke of the waters of the well : but we will goe along by the kings high way , vntill wee be past thy borders .
And Sihon would not suffer Israel to passe thorow his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wildernes : and he came to Iahaz , and fought against Israel .
And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Arnon vnto Iabok , euen vnto the children of Ammon : for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
And Israel tooke all these cities : and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all the villages thereof .
For Heshbon was the citie of Sihon the King of the Amorites , who had fought against the former King of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , euen vnto Arnon .
Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes , say , Come into Heshbon : let the citie of Sihon bee built and prepared .
For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the citie of Sihon : it hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lordes of the high places of Arnon .
Woe to thee , Moab , thou art vndone , O people of Chemosh : he hath giuen his sonnes that escaped , and his daughters , into captiuitie vnto Sihon King of the Amorites .
We haue shot at them ; Heshbon is perished euen vnto Dibon , and we haue layde them waste euen vnto Nophah , which reacheth vnto Medeba .
¶ Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites .
And Moses sent to spy out Iaazer , and they tooke the villages thereof , and droue out the Amorites that were there .
¶ And they turned and went vp by the way of Bashan : and Og the King of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battell at Edrei .
And the Lord said vnto Moses , Feare him not : for I haue deliuered him into thy hand , and all his people , and his land , and thou shalt doe to him as thou didst vnto Sihon King of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .

¶ And Balak the sonne of Zippor , saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites . And Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many , and Moab was distressed , because of the children of Israel .
And Moab said vnto the elders of Midian ; Now shall this company licke vp all that are round about vs , as the oxe licketh vp the grasse of the field . And Balak the sonne of Zippor , was King of the Moabites at that time .
He sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor , to Pethor , which is by the riuer of the land of the children of his people , to call him , saying , Behold , there is a people come out from Egypt : beholde , they couer the face of the earth , and they abide ouer against me .
Come now therefore , I pray thee , curse mee this people , for they are too mightie for me : peraduenture I shall preuaile , that we may smite them , and that I may driue them out of the land : for I wot that he whom thou blessest , is blessed , and hee whom thou cursest , is cursed .
And the elders of Moab , and the elders of Midian departed , with the rewards of diuination in their hand ; and they came vnto Balaam , and spake vnto him the words of Balak .
And hee said vnto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word againe as the Lord shal speake vnto mee : and the Princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
And God came vnto Balaam , and said , What men are these with thee ?
And Balaam said vnto God , Balak the sonne of Zippor , King of Moab , hath sent vnto me , saying ;
Behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which couereth the face of the earth : Come now , curse me them ; peraduenture I shalbe able to ouercome them , and driue them out .
And God saide vnto Balaam ; Thou shalt not goe with them , thou shalt not curse the people : for they are blessed .
And Balaam rose vp in the morning , and said vnto the Princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the Lord refuseth to giue mee leaue to goe with you .
And the Princes of Moab rose vp , and they went vnto Balak , and said , Balaam refuseth to come with vs .
¶ And Balak sent yet againe Princes , moe , and more honourable then they .
And they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor ; Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from comming vnto me :
For I wil promote thee vnto very great honour , and I will do whatsoeuer thou saiest vnto me : Come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
And Balaam answered and said vnto the seruants of Balak , If Balak would giue me his house full of siluer and gold , I cannot goe beyond the word of the Lord my God , to doe lesse or more .
Now therefore , I pray you , tarie yee also here this night , that I may know what the Lord will say vnto me more .
And God came vnto Balaam at night , and said vnto him , If the men come to call thee , rise vp , and goe with them : but yet the word which I shall say vnto thee , that shalt thou doe .
And Balaam rose vp in the morning , and sadled his asse , and went with the princes of Moab .
¶ And Gods anger was kindled , because he went : and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way for an aduersarie against him : Now he was riding vpon his asse , and his two seruants were with him .
And the Asse sawe the Angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawen in his hand : and the asse turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the asse , to turne her into the way .
But the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , & a wall on that side .
And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord , she thrust her selfe vnto the wall , and crusht Balaams foote against the wall : and hee smote her againe .
And the Angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrowe place , where was no way to turne , either to the right hand , or to the left .
And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord , shee fell downe vnder Balaam , and Balaams anger was kindled , and hee smote the asse with a staffe .
And the Lord opened the mouth of the asse , and shee saide vnto Balaam , What haue I done vnto thee , that thou hast smitten mee these three times ?
And Balaam said vnto the asse , Because thou hast mocked mee : I would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would I kill thee .
And the asse said vnto Balaam , Am not I thine asse , vpon which thou hast ridden euer since I was thine , vnto this day ? was I euer wont to do so vnto thee ? And he said , Nay .
Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and hee saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawen in his hand : and hee bowed downe his head , and fell flat on his face .
And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him , Wherefore hast thou smitten thine asse these three times ? Behold , I went out to withstand thee , because thy way is peruerse before me .
And the asse saw me , and turned from me these three times : vnlesse shee had turned from me , surely now also I had slaine thee , and saued her aliue .
And Balaam said vnto the Angel of the Lord , I haue sinned : for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against mee : Now therefore if it displease thee , I will get mee backe againe .
And the Angel of the Lord said vnto Balaam , Goe with the men : but onely the word that I shall speake vnto thee , that thou shalt speake : So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come , hee went out to meete him , vnto a citie of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the vtmost coast .
And Balak said vnto Balaam , Did I not earnestly send vnto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not vnto me ? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
And Balaam saide vnto Balak , Loe , I am come vnto thee : haue I now any power at all to say any thing ? the worde that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speake .

And Balaam said vnto Balak , Stand by thy burnt offring , and I wil goe : peraduenture the Lord will come to meete mee ; and whatsoeuer he sheweth me , I will tell thee . And he went to an high place .
And God met Balaam , and he said vnto him , I haue prepared seuen altars , and I haue offered vpon euery altar a bullocke and a ramme .
And the Lord put a word in Balaams mouth , and said , Returne vnto Balak , & thus thou shalt speake .
And he returned vnto him , and loe , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , hee , and all the Princes of Moab .
And he tooke vp his parable , and said , Balak the King of Moab hath brought mee from Aram , out of the mountaines of the East , saying , Come , curse me Iacob , and come , defie Israel .
How shall I curse , whom God hath not cursed ? or how shall I defie , whom the Lord hath not defied ?
For from the top of the rockes I see him , and from the hilles I behold him : loe , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not bee reckoned among the nations .
Who can count the dust of Iacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? Let mee die the death of the righteous , & let my last end be like his .
And Balak saide vnto Balaam , What hast thou done vnto me ? I tooke thee to curse mine enemies , and behold , thou hast blessed them altogether .
And he answered , and said , Must I not take heede to speake that which the Lord hath put in my mouth ?
And Balak said vnto him , Come , I pray thee , with me , vnto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
¶ And hee brought him into the fielde of Zophim , to the toppe of Pisgah , and built seuen altars , and offered a bullocke and a ramme on euery altar .
And he said vnto Balak , Stand here by thy burnt offering , while I meete the Lord yonder .
And the Lord met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and saide , Goe againe vnto Balak , and say thus .
And when hee came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offring , and the Princes of Moab with him . And Balak said vnto him , What hath the Lord spoken ?
And he tooke vp his parable , and said , Rise vp Balak , & heare ; hearken vnto me , thou sonne of Zippor :
God is not a man that he should lie , neither the sonne of man , that hee should repent : hath he said , and shall he not doe it ? or , hath hee spoken , and shall he not make it good ?
Behold , I haue receiued commandement to blesse : and hee hath blessed , and I cannot reuerse it .
Hee hath not beheld iniquitie in Iacob , neither hath he seene peruersenesse in Israel : the Lord his God is with him , and the shoute of a King is among them .
God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an Unicorne .
Surely there is no inchantment against Iacob , neither is there any diuination against Israel : according to this time it shalbe said of Iacob , and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
Beholde , the people shall rise vp as a great Lion , and lift vp himselfe as a yong Lion : hee shall not lie downe vntill he eate of the pray , and drinke the blood of the slaine .
¶ And Balak said vnto Balaam , Neither curse them at all , nor blesse them at all .
But Balaam answered , and said vnto Balak , Told not I thee , saying , All that the Lord speaketh , that I must doe ?
¶ And Balak saide vnto Balaam , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee vnto another place , peraduenture it will please God , that thou mayest curse me them from thence .
And Balak brought Balaam vnto the top of Peor , that looketh toward Ieshimon .

And when Balaam sawe that it pleased the Lord to blesse Israel , hee went not , as at other times to seeke for inchantments , but hee set his face toward the wildernesse .
And Balaam lift vp his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents , according to their Tribes : and the Spirit of God came vpon him .
And he tooke vp his parable , and said , Balaam the sonne of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
Hee hath said , which heard the words of God , which saw the vision of the Almightie , falling into a trance , but hauing his eyes open :
How goodly are thy tents , O Iacob , and thy Tabernacles , O Israel !
As the valleyes are they spread forth , as gardens by the riuer side , as the trees of Lign - Aloes which the Lord hath planted , and as Cedar trees beside the waters .
He shall powre the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his King shall be higher then Agag , and his Kingdome shall be exalted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt , he hath as it were the strength of an Unicorne : he shall eate vp the nations his enemies , and shall breake their bones , and pierce them thorow with his arrowes .
Hee couched , he lay downe as a Lyon , and as a great Lyon : who shal stirre him vp ? Blessed is hee that blesseth thee , and cursed is hee that curseth thee .
¶ And Balaks anger was kindled against Balaam , and hee smote his hands together : and Balak said vnto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
Therefore now , flee thou to thy place : I thought to promote thee vnto great honour , but loe , the Lord hath kept thee backe from honour .
And Balaam said vnto Balak , Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest vnto me , saying ,
If Balak would give mee his house full of siluer and gold , I cannot goe beyond the commandement of the Lord , to doe either good or bad of mine owne mind ? But what the Lord saith , that will I speake .
And now beholde , I goe vnto my people : come therefore , and I will aduertise thee , what this people shall doe to thy people in the latter dayes .
¶ And hee tooke vp his parable , and said , Balaam the sonne of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open , hath said :
He hath said which heard the words of God , and knewe the knowledge of the most High , which sawe the vision of the Almightie , falling into a trance , but hauing his eyes open .
I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not nigh : There shall come a starre out of Iacob , and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel , and shall smite the corners of Moab , and destroy all the children of Sheth .
And Edom shall bee a possession , Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies , and Israel shall doe valiantly .
Out of Iacob shall come he that shall haue dominion , and shall destroy him that remaineth of the citie .
¶ And when he looked on Amalek , he tooke vp his parable , and sayd , Amalek was the first of the nations , but his latter end shall bee , that hee perish for euer .
And hee looked on the Kenites , and tooke vp his parable , and saide , Strong is thy dwelling place , and thou puttest thy nest in a rocke :
Neuerthelesse , the Kenite shall be wasted , vntil Asshur shal carie thee away captiue .

And he went after the man of Israel into the tent , and thrust both of them thorow , the man of Israel , and the woman , thorow her belly : So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel .
And those that died in the plague , were twentie and foure thousand .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar , the sonne of Aaron the Priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , ( while hee was zealous for my sake among them ) that I consumed not the children of Israel in my ielousie .
Wherefore say , Behold , I giue vnto him my Couenant of peace .

¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying , Unto these the land shall be diuided for an inheritance , according to the number of names .
To many thou shalt giue the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt giue the lesse inheritance : to euery one shall his inheritance be giuen , according to those that were numbred of him .

And they stood before Moses , and before Eleazar the Priest , and before the Princes , and all the Congregation , by the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation , saying ,
Our father died in the wildernesse , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselues together against the Lord in the company of Korah : but died in his owne sinne , and had no sonnes .
Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no sonne ? Giue vnto vs therefore a possession among the brethren of our father . And Moses brought their cause before the Lord .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
The daughters of Zelophehad speake right : thou shalt surely giue them a possession of an inheritance among their fathers brethren , and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to passe vnto them .
And thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and haue no sonne , then yee shall cause his inheritance to passe vnto his daughter .
And if he haue no daughter , then yee shall giue his inheritance vnto his brethren .
And if he haue no brethren , then yee shall giue his inheritance vnto his fathers brethren .

And Moses spake vnto the heads of the tribes , concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded .
If a man vowe a vow vnto the Lord , or sweare an othe to bind his soule with a bond : he shall not breake his word , hee shall doe according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
If a woman also vow a vow vnto the Lord , and binde her selfe by a bond , being in her fathers house in her youth ;
And her father heare her vow , and her bond wherewith shee hath bound her soule , and her father shall holde his peace at her : then all her vowes shall stand , and euery bond wherewith shee hath bound her soule , shall stand .
But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth ; not any of her vowes or of her bonds , wherewith she hath bound her soule , shall stand : and the Lord shall forgiue her , because her father disallowed her .
And if she had at all an husband when she vowed , or vttered ought out of her lips , wherewith shee bound her soule ,
But euery vow of a widow , and of her that is diuorced , wherewith they haue bound their soules , shall stand against her .
And if she vowed in her husbands house , or bound her soule by a bond with an oath ;
And her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and disallowed her not : then all her vowes shall stand , and euery bond wherewith shee bound her soule , shall stand .
But if her husband hath vtterly made them voyd on the day hee heard them : then whatsoeuer proceeded out of her lips concerning her vowes , or concerning the bond of her soule , shall not stand : her husband hath made them voyd , and the Lord shal forgiue her .
Euery vow , and euery binding othe to afflict the soule , her husband may establish it , or her husband may make it voyd .
But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her , from day to day , then he establisheth all her vowes , or all her bonds which are vpon her : hee confirmeth them , because hee held his peace at her , in the day that hee heard them .
But if hee shall any wayes make them voyd after that he hath heard them , then he shall beare her iniquitie .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Auenge the children of Israel of the Midianites : afterward shalt thou be gathered vnto thy people .
And Moses spake vnto the people , saying , Arme some of your selues vnto the warre , and let them goe against the Midianites , and auenge the Lord of Midian .
Of euery tribe a thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , shall ye send to the warre .
So there were deliuered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of euery tribe , twelue thousand armed for warre .
And Moses sent them to the warre , a thousand of euery tribe , them and Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest , to the warre , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow , in his hand .
And they warred against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses , and they slew all the males .
And they slew the Kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slaine ; namely Eui , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , fiue Kings of Midian ; Balaam also the sonne of Beor they slew with the sword .
And the children of Israel tooke all the women of Midian captiues , and their little ones , and tooke the spoile of all their cattell , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt , and all their goodly castles with fire :
And they tooke all the spoile , and all the pray , both of men and of beasts .
And they brought the captiues , and the pray , and the spoile vnto Moses and Eleazar the Priest , and vnto the Congregation of the children of Israel , vnto the campe at the plaines of Moab , which are by Iordan neere Iericho .
¶ And Moses and Eleazar the Priest , and all the Princes of the Congregation went foorth to meete them without the campe .
And Moses was wroth with the officers of the hoste , with the captaines ouer thousands , and captaines ouer hundreds , which came from the battel .
And Moses said vnto them , Haue ye saued all the women aliue ?
Behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsell of Balaam , to commit trespasse against the Lord in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the Congregation of the Lord . Now therefore kill euery male among the little ones , and kill euery woman that hath knowen man , by lying with him .
But all the women children that haue not knowen a man by lying with him , keepe aliue for your selues .
And doe yee abide without the campe seuen dayes : whosoeuer hath killed any person , and whosoeuer hath touched any slaine , purifie both your selues , and your captiues , on the third day , and on the seuenth day .
And purifie all your raiment , and all that is made of skinnes , and all worke of goates haire , and all things made of wood .
¶ And Eleazar the Priest said vnto the men of warre which went to the battell , This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commaunded Moses .
Onely the gold , and the siluer , the brasse , the yron , the tinne , and the lead ,
Euery thing that may abide the fire , yee shall make it goe through the fire , and it shall be cleane : neuerthelesse , it shall be purified with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire , yee shall make goe through the water .
And ye shall wash your clothes on the seuenth day , and ye shalbe cleane , and afterward yee shall come into the campe .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Take the summe of the pray , that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou and Eleazar the Priest , and the chiefe fathers of the Congregation :
And diuide the pray into two parts , betweene them that tooke the warre vpon them , who went out to battell , and betweene all the Congregation .
And leuie a tribute vnto the Lord of the men of warre which went out to battell : one soule of fiue hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeues , and of the asses , and of the sheepe .
Take it of their halfe , and giue it vnto Eleazar the Priest , for an heaue offering of the Lord .
And of the children of Israels halfe , thou shalt take one portion of fiftie , of the persons , of the beeues , of the asses , and of the flockes , of all maner of beasts , and giue them vnto the Leuites , which keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Lord .
And Moses and Eleazar the Priest did as the Lord commanded Moses .
And the bootie being the rest of the pray which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand , and seuenty thousand , and fiue thousand sheepe , And threescore and twelue thousand beeues ,
And threescore and one thousand asses :
And the persons were sixteene thousand , of which the Lords tribute was thirtie and two persons .
And sixteene thousand persons )

Wee haue therefore brought an oblation for the Lord , what euerie man hath gotten , of iewels of golde chaines , and bracelets , rings , earerings , and tablets , to make an atonement for our soules before the Lord .
And Moses and Eleazar the Priest tooke the gold of them : euen all wrought iewels .

Wherefore , said they , if wee haue found grace in thy sight , let this lande be giuen vnto thy seruants for a possession , and bring vs not ouer Iordane .
¶ And Moses said vnto the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , Shall your brethren goe to warre , and shall ye sit here ?
And wherefore discourage yee the heart of the children of Israel from going ouer into the lande , which the Lord hath giuen them ?
Thus did your fathers , when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land .
For when they went vp vnto the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not goe into the land which the Lord had giuen them .
And the Lords anger was kindled the same time , and hee sware , saying ,
Surely none of the men that came vp out of Egypt , from twentie yeeres old and vpward , shall see the lande which I sware vnto Abraham , vnto Isaac , and vnto Iacob , because they haue not wholly followed me :
Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite , and Ioshua the sonne of Nun : for they haue wholly followed the Lord .
And the Lords anger was kindled against Israel , and hee made them wander in the wildernesse fourty yeeres , vntill all the generation that had done euill in the sight of the Lord was consumed .
And beholde , ye are risen vp in your fathers stead , an increase of sinfull men , to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel .
For if yee turne away from after him , hee will yet againe leaue them in the wildernesse , and ye shall destroy all this people .
¶ And they came neere vnto him , and said , Wee will build sheepfoldes here for our cattell , and cities for our litle ones .
But we ourselues will goe ready armed before the children of Israel , vntill wee haue brought them vnto their place : and our litle ones shall dwell in the fenced cities , because of the inhabitants of the land .
Wee will not returne vnto our houses , vntill the children of Israel haue inherited euery man his inheritance :
For wee will not inherite with them on yonder side Iordane , or forward , because our inheritance is fallen to vs on this side Iordane Eastward .
¶ And Moses said vnto them , If ye will doe this thing , if ye will goe armed before the Lord to warre , And will goe all of you armed ouer Iordane before the Lord , vntill he hath driuen out his enemies from before him ,
And the land bee subdued before the Lord : then afterward ye shall returne , and bee guiltlesse before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
But if ye will not doe so , behold , yee haue sinned against the Lord : and bee sure your sinne will finde you out .
Build ye cities for your litle ones , and folds for your sheepe , and doe that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
And the children of Gad , and the children of Reuben spake vnto Moses , saying , Thy seruants will doe as my lord commandeth .
Our little ones , our wiues , our flocks , and all our cattell shall be there in the cities of Gilead .
But thy seruants will passe ouer , euery man armed for warre , before the Lord to battell , as my lord saith .
So concerning them Moses commaunded Eleazar the Priest , and Ioshua the sonne of Nun , and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel :
And Moses said vnto them , If the children of Gad , and the children of Reuben will passe with you ouer Iordane , euery man armed to battell before the Lord , and the land shall be subdued before you , then ye shall giue them the land of Gilead for a possession :
But if they will not passe ouer with you armed , they shall haue possessions among you in the land of Canaan .
And the children of Gad , and the children of Reuben answered , saying , As the Lord hath said vnto thy seruants , so will we doe .
Wee will passe ouer armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Iordane may be ours . And Moses gaue vnto them , euen to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben ; and vnto halfe the tribe of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph , the kingdome of Sihon King of the Amorites , and the kingdome of Og King of Bashan , the land with the cities thereof , in the coastes , euen the cities of the countrey round about .
¶ And the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer , And Atroth , Shophan , and Iaazer , and Iogbehah ,
And Bethnimrah , and Bethharan , fenced cities : and foldes for sheepe . And the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kiriathaim ,
And Nebo , and Baalmeon ( their names being changed ) and Shibmah : and gaue other names vnto the cities which they builded .
And the children of Machir , the sonne of Manasseh , went to Gilead , and tooke it , and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it .
And Moses gaue Gilead vnto Machir the sonne of Manasseh , and he dwelt therein .
And Iair the sonne of Manasseh went and tooke the small townes thereof , and called them Hauoth - Iair .

Then ye shall driue out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite plucke downe all their high places .
And ye shall dispossesse the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for I haue giuen you the land to possesse it .
And ye shall diuide the land by lot , for an inheritance among your families , and to the moe ye shall giue the more inheritance , and to the fewer yee shall giue the lesse inheritance : euery mans inheritance shall bee in the place where his lot falleth , according to the tribes of your fathers , ye shall inherite .
But if ye will not driue out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then it shall come to passe that those which ye let remaine of them , shall be prickes in your eyes , and thornes in your sides , and shal vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Command the children of Israel , and say vnto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan , ( this is the land that shall fall vnto you for an inheritance , euen the land of Canaan , with the coasts thereof . )
Then your South quarter shall be from the wildernesse of Zin , along by the coast of Edom , and your South border shall be the outmost coast of the salt Sea Eastward .
And your border shal turne from the South to the ascent of Akrabbim , and passe on to Zin : and the going foorth thereof shall be from the South to Kadesh - Barnea , and shall goe on to Hazar - Addar , and passe on to Azmon .
And the border shall fetch a comcompasse from Azmon vnto the riuer of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
And as for the Westerne border , you shall euen haue the great sea for a border : this shall be your West border . And this shall be your North border : from the great sea , you shall point out for you , mount Hor .
From mount Hor , ye shall point out your border vnto the entrance of Hamath : and the goings foorth of the border shall be to Zedad . ¶ And the border shall goe on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall bee at Hazar Enan : this shall be your North border .
And ye shall point out your East border , from Hazar Enan to Shepham .
And the coast shall goe downe from Shepham to Riblah , on the East side of Ain : and the border shall descend and shall reach vnto the side of the sea of Chinnereth Eastward .
And the border shall goe downe to Iordane , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coastes thereof round about .
And Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inherite by lot , which the Lord commanded to giue vnto the nine tribes , and to the halfe tribe .

Of the tribe of Beniamin , Elidad the sonne of Chislon . And the Prince of the tribe of the children of Dan , Bukki the sonne of Iogli .

And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the plaines of Moab by Iordane , neere Iericho , saying ,
Command the children of Israel , that they giue vnto the Leuites of the inheritance of their possession , cities to dwell in : and yee shall giue also vnto the Leuites suburbs for the cities round about them .
And the cities shall they haue to dwell in , and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattell , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
And the suburbs of the cities , which yee shall giue vnto the Leuites , shall reach from the wall of the citie , and outward , a thousand cubites round about .
And ye shall measure from without the city on the Eastside two thousand cubites , and on the Southside two thousand cubites , and on the Westside two thousand cubites , & on the Northside two thousand cubites : and the citie shall be in the midst ; this shalbe to them the suburbs of the cities .
And among the cities which yee shal giue vnto the Leuites , there shalbe sixe cities for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that hee may flee thither : And to them ye shall adde fourty and two cities .
So all the cities which ye shall giue to the Leuites , shall be fourty and eight cities : them shall yee giue with their suburbs .
And the cities which ye shal giue , shalbe of the possession of the children of Israel : from them that haue many ye shall giue many ; but from them that haue few , ye shall giue few . Euery one shal giue of his cities vnto the Leuites , according to his inheritance which he inheriteth .
¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses , saying ,
Speake vnto the children of Israel , and say vnto them , When ye bee come ouer Iordane , into the land of Canaan :
Then ye shall appoint you cities , to be cities of refuge for you ; that the slayer may flee thither which killeth any person at vnawares .
And they shall be vnto you cities for refuge from the auenger , that the man - slayer die not , vntill he stand before the Congregation in iudgement .
And of these cities which ye shall giue , sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge . Yee shall giue three cities on this side Iordane , and three cities shall yee giue in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
These sixe cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the soiourner among them : that euery one that killeth any person vnawares , may flee thither .
And if he smite him with an instrument of Iron , ( so that he die , ) hee is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
The reuenger of blood himselfe shall slay the murtherer : when he meeteth him , he shall slay him .
But if he thrust him of hatred , or hurle at him by laying of waite that he die ,
Or in enmitie smite him with his hand , that he die : hee that smote him shall surely be put to death , for hee is a murderer : the reuenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when hee meeteth him .
But if hee thrust him suddenly without enmitie , or haue cast vpon him any thing without laying of wait ,
Or with any stone wherewith a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it vpon him , that he die , and was not his enemie , neither sought his harme :
Then the Congregation shall iudge betweene the slayer , and the reuenger of blood , according to these iudgements .
And the Congregation shall deliuer the slayer out of the hand of the reuenger of blood , and the Congregation shal restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it vnto the death of the high Priest , which was annoynted with the holy oyle .
But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the citie of his refuge , whither he was fled :
And the reuenger of blood finde him without the borders of the citie of his refuge , and the reuenger of blood kill the slayer , he shall not be guiltie of blood :
Because he should haue remained in the citie of his refuge , vntill the death of the high Priest : but after the death of the hie Priest , the slayer shal returne into the land of his possession .
So these things shall be for a statute of iudgment vnto you , thorowout your generations in al your dwellings .
Who so killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death , by the mouth of witnesses : but one witnesse shall not testifie against any person , to cause him to die .
Moreouer , yee shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , which is guiltie of death , but he shalbe surely put to death .
And yee shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge , that hee should come againe to dwell in the land , vntil the death of the Priest .
So ye shall not pollute the lande wherein ye are : for blood , it defileth the land : and the land cannot bee cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .

And the chiefe fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the sonne of Machir , the sonne of Manasseh , of the families of the sonnes of Ioseph , came neere , and spake before Moses , and before the Princes the chiefe fathers of the children of Israel .
And they said , The Lord commanded my lord to giue the lande for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the Lord , to giue the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother , vnto his daughters .
And if they bee married to any of the sonnes of the other tribes of the children of Israel , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and shall bee put to the inheritance of the tribe , whereinto they are receiued : so shal it be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
And when the Iubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put vnto the inheritance of the tribe , whereunto they are receiued : So shal their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
And Moses commanded the children of Israel , according to the worde of the Lord , saying , The tribe of the sonnes of Ioseph hath said well .
This is the thing which the Lord doeth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they thinke best : onely to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remooue from tribe to tribe : for euery one of the children of Israel shall keepe himselfe to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
And euery daughter that possesseth an inheritance , in any tribe of the children of Israel , shall be wife vnto one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may enioy euery man the inheritance of his fathers .
Neither shall the inheritance remoue from one tribe to another tribe : but euery one of the tribes of the children of Israel , shall keepe himselfe to his owne inheritance .
Euen as the Lord commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad .
For Mahlah , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad , were married vnto their fathers brothers sonnes .
And they were married into the families of the sonnes of Manasseh , the sonne of Ioseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .

The vision of Obadiah : Thus saith the Lord God , concerning Edom ; Wee haue heard a rumour from the Lord , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen : Arise yee , and let vs rise vp against her in battell .
Behold , I haue made thee small among the heathen : thou art greatly despised .
¶ The pride of thine heart hath deceiued thee : thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rocke , Whose habitation is high , that saith in his heart : Who shall bring me downe to the ground ?
Though thou exalt thy selfe as the eagle , and though thou set thy nest among the starres , thence will I bring thee downe , saith the Lord .
If theeues came to thee , if robbers by night ( how art thou cut off ? ) would they not haue stollen til they had enough ? if the grape gatherers came to thee , would they not leaue some grapes ?
How are the things of Esau searched out ? how are his hid things sought vp ? All the men of thy confederacie haue brought thee euen to the border : the men that were at peace with thee , haue deceiued thee , and preuailed against thee : they that eate thy bread haue laide a wound vnder thee : there is none vnderstanding in him .
Shal I not in that day , saith the Lord , euen destroy the wise men out of Edom , and vnderstanding out of the mount of Esau ?
And thy mightie men , O Teman , shall be dismayed , to the end that euery one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter .
¶ For thy violence against thy brother Iacob shame shall couer thee , and thou shalt be cut off for euer .
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side , in the day that the strangers caried away captiue his forces , and forreiners entred into his gates , and cast lots vpon Ierusalem , euen thou wast as one of them .
But thou shouldest not haue looked on the day of thy brother in the day that hee became a stranger , neither shouldest thou haue reioyced ouer the children of Iudah in the day of their destruction : neither shouldest thou haue spoken proudly in the day of distresse .
Thou shouldest not haue entred into the gate of my people in the day of their calamitie : yea , thou shouldest not haue looked on their affliction in the day of their calamitie , nor haue laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamitie .
Neither shouldest thou haue stood in the crosse way to cut off those of his that did escape , neither shouldest thou haue deliuered vp those of his that did remaine in the day of distresse .
For the day of the Lord is neere vpon all the heathen : as thou hast done , it shall bee done vnto thee , thy reward shall returne vpon thine owne head .
For as ye haue drunke vpon my holy mountaine , so shall all the heathen drinke continually : yea , they shall drinke , and they shall swallow downe , and they shall bee as though they had not bene .
¶ But vpon mount Zion shall be deliuerance , and there shall be holinesse , and the house of Iacob shall possesse their possessions .
And the house of Iacob shall bee a fire , and the house of Ioseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble , and they shall kindle in them and deuoure them , and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau , for the Lord hath spoken it .
And they of the South shall possesse the mount of Esau , and they of the plaine , the Philistines : and they shall possesse the fields of Ephraim , and the fields of Samaria , and Beniamin shall possesse Gilead .
And the captiuitie of this hoste of the children of Israel shall possesse that of the Canaanites euen vnto Zarephath , and the captiuitie of Ierusalem which is in Sepharad , shall possesse the cities of the South .

Paul and Timotheus the seruants of Iesus Christ , to all the Saints in Christ Iesus , which are at Philippi , with the Bishops and Deacons :
Grace be vnto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Iesus Christ .
I thanke my God vpon euery remembrance of you ,
Alwayes in euery prayer of mine for you all making request , with ioy
For your felowship in the Gospel from the first day vntill now ;
Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you , will performe it vntil the day of Iesus Christ :
Euen as it is meete for mee to thinke this of you all , because I haue you in my heart , in as much as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the Gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
For God is my record , how greatly I long after you all , in the bowels of Iesus Christ .
And this I pray , that your loue may abound yet more & more in knowledge , and in all iudgment .
That ye may approue things that are excellent , that ye may be sincere , and without offence till the day of Christ .
Being filled with the fruites of righteousnesse , which are by Iesus Christ vnto the glory and praise of God .
But I would yee should vnderstand brethren , that the things which happened vnto mee , haue fallen out rather vnto the furtherance of the Gospel .
So that my bonds in Christ , are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places .
And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident , by my bonds , are much more bold to speake the word without feare .
But the other of loue , knowing that I am set for the defence of the Gospel .
What then ? Notwithstanding euery way , whether in pretence , or in trueth : Christ is preached , and I therein doe reioyce , yea , and will reioyce .
For I know that this shall turne to my saluation through your prayer , and the supplie of the spirit of Iesus Christ ,
According to my earnest expectation , and my hope , that in nothing I shalbe ashamed : but that with all boldnes , as alwayes , so now also Christ shal be magnified in my body , whether it be by life or by death .
For to me to liue is Christ , and to die is gaine .
But if I liue in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shal chuse , I wote not .
For I am in a strait betwixt two , hauing a desire to depart , & to bee with Christ , which is farre better .
Neuertheles , to abide in the flesh , is more needfull for you .
And hauing this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all , for your furtherance and ioy of faith ,
That your reioycing may bee more abundant in Iesus Christ for me , by my comming to you againe .
Onely let your conuersation bee as it becommeth the Gospel of Christ , that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may heare of your affaires , that yee stand fast in one spirit , with one minde , striuing together for the faith of the Gospel ,
And in nothing terrified by your aduersaries , which is to them an euident token of perdition : but to you of saluation , and that of God .
For vnto you it is giuen in the behalfe of Christ , not onely to beleeue on him , but also to suffer for his sake ,
<NON-VERSE>
Let nothing bee done through strife , or vaine glory , but in lowlinesse of minde let each esteeme other better then themselues .
Looke not euery man on his owne things , but euery man also on the things of others .
But made himselfe of no reputation , and tooke vpon him the forme of a seruant , and was made in the likenesse of men .
And being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himselfe , and became obedient vnto death , euen the death of the Crosse .
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and giuen him a Name which is aboue euery name :
That at the Name of Iesus euery knee should bow , of things in heauen , and things in earth , and things vnder the earth :
And that euery tongue should confesse , that Iesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
Wherefore , my beloued , as yee haue alwayes obeyed , not as in my presence onely , but now much more in my absence ; worke out your owne saluation with feare , and trembling .
For it is God which worketh in you , both to will , and to doe , of his good pleasure .
Doe all things without murmurings , and disputings :
That yee may bee blamelesse and harmelesse , the sonnes of God , without rebuke , in the middes of a crooked and peruerse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world :
Holding foorth the word of life , that I may reioyce in the day of Christ , that I haue not runne in vaine , neither laboured in vaine .
Yea , and if I bee offered vpon the sacrifice and seruice of your faith , I ioy , and reioyce with you all .
For the same cause also doe ye ioy , and reioyce with me .
But I trust in the Lord Iesus , to send Timotheus shortly vnto you , that I also may bee of good comfort , when I know your state .
For I haue no man like minded , who will naturally care for your state .
For all seeke their owne , not the things which are Iesus Christs .
But ye know the proofe of him , That as a sonne with the father , hee hath serued with me , in the Gospel .
Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soone as I shall see how it wil goe with me .
But I trust in the Lord , that I also my selfe shall come shortly .
Yet I supposed it necessary , to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour , and fellow souldiour , but your messenger , and hee that ministred to my wants .
For hee longed after you all , and was full of heauinesse , because that yee had heard that he had bene sicke .
For indeed he was sicke nigh vnto death , but God had mercy on him : and not on him onely , but on mee also , lest I should haue sorow vpon sorow .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that when ye see him againe , ye may reioyce , and that I may bee the lesse sorrowfull .
Receiue him therfore in the Lord with all gladnesse , and hold such in reputation :
<NON-VERSE>
Finally , my brethren , reioyce in the Lorde . To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grieuous : but for you it is safe .
Beware of dogs , beware of euill workers : beware of the concision .
For we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and reioyce in Christ Iesus , and haue no confidence in the flesh .
Though I might also haue confidence in the flesh . If any other man thinketh that hee hath whereof hee might trust in the flesh , I more :
Circumcised the eight day , of the stocke of Israel , of the tribe of Beniamin , an Hebrew of the Hebrewes , as touching the Law , a Pharise :
Concerning zeale , persecuting the Church : touching the righteousnesse which is in the Law , blamelesse .
But what things were gaine to me , those I counted losse for Christ .
Yea doubtlesse , and I count all things but losse , for the excellencie of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord : for whom I haue suffered the losse of all things , and doe count them but doung , that I may win Christ ,
And be found in him , not hauing mine owne righteousnesse , which is of the Law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousnesse which is of God by faith :
That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable vnto his death ,
If by any meanes I might attaine vnto the resurrection of the dead .
Not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Iesus .
Brethren , I count not my selfe to haue apprehended : but this one thing I doe , forgetting those things which are behinde , and reaching forth vnto those things which are before ,
I presse toward the marke , for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus .
Let vs therefore , as many as bee perfect , bee thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shal reueale euen this vnto you .
Neuerthelesse , whereto wee haue alreadie attained , let vs walke by the same rule , let vs minde the same thing .
Brethren , be followers together of me , and marke them which walke so , as ye haue vs for an ensample .
( For many walke , of whome I haue told you often , and now tell you euen weeping , that they are the enemies of the crosse of Christ :
Whose end is destruction , whose God is their belly , and whose glorie is in their shame , who minde earthly things . )
For our conuersation is in heauen , from whence also we looke for the Sauiour , the Lord Iesus Christ :
<NON-VERSE>
Therefore , my brethren , dearely beloued and longed for , my ioy and crowne , so stand fast in the Lord , my dearely beloued .
I beseech Euodias , and beseech Syntiche , that they be of the same mind in the Lord .
And I entreat thee also , true yokefellow , helpe those women which laboured with me in the Gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellow labourers , whose names are in the booke of life .
Reioyce in the Lord alway : and againe I say , Reioyce .
Let your moderation be knowen vnto all men . The Lord is at hand .
Bee carefull for nothing : but in euery thing by prayer and supplication with thankesgiuing , let your request be made knowen vnto God .
And the peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding , shall keepe your hearts & minds through Christ Iesus .
Finally , brethren , whatsoeuer things are true , whatsoeuer things are honest , whatsoeuer things are iust , whatsoeuer things are pure , whatsoeuer things are louely , whatsoeuer things are of good report : if there bee any vertue , and if there bee any praise , thinke on these things :
Those things which ye haue both learned and receiued , and heard , and seene in mee , doe : and the God of peace shall be with you .
But I reioyced in the Lorde greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished againe , wherein yee were also carefull , but ye lacked opportunitie .
Not that I speake in respect of want : for I haue learned in whatsoeuer state I am , therewith to bee content .
I know both how to bee abased , and I knowe how to abound : euerie where , and in all things I am instructed , both to bee full , and to bee hungrie , both to abound , and to suffer need .
I can do all things through Christ , which strengtheneth me .
Notwithstanding , yee haue well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
Now ye Philippians know also , that in the beginning of the Gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no Church communicated with mee , as concerning giuing and receiuing , but ye onely .
For euen in Thessalonica , ye sent once , and againe vnto my necessitie .
Not because I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that may abound to your account .
But I haue all , and abound . I am full , hauing receiued of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , well pleasing to God .
But my God shall supply all your need , according to his riches in glory , by Christ Iesus .
Now vnto God and our Father be glory for euer and euer . Amen .
Salute euery Saint in Christ Iesus : the brethren which are with me , greet you .
All the Saints salute you , chiefly they that are of Cesars houshold .

And to our beloued Apphia , and Archippus our fellow Souldier , and to the Church in thy house .
Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Iesus Christ .
I thanke my God , making mention of thee alwayes in my prayers ,
Hearing of thy loue , and faith , which thou hast toward the Lord Iesus , and toward all Saints :
That the communication of thy faith may become effectuall by the acknowledging of euery good thing , which is in you in Christ Iesus .
For wee haue great ioy and consolation in thy loue , because the bowels of the Saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
Wherefore , though I might bee much bolde in Christ to enioyne thee that which is conuenient ;
Yet for loues sake I rather beseech thee , being such a one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Iesus Christ .
I beseech thee for my sonne Onesimus , whome I haue begotten in my bonds ,
Which in time past was to thee vnprofitable : but now profitable to thee and to me :
Whom I haue sent againe : thou therfore receiue him , that is mine owne bowels .
Whome I would haue reteined with mee , that in thy stead hee might haue ministred vnto me in the bonds of the Gospel .
But without thy minde would I doe nothing , that thy benefite should not bee as it were of necessitie , but willingly .
For perhaps hee therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receiue him for euer :
Not now as a seruant , but aboue a seruant , a brother beloued , specially to mee , but how much more vnto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
If thou count mee therefore a partner , receiue him as my selfe .
If hee hath wronged thee , or oweth thee ought , put that on mine account .
I Paul haue written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I doe not say to thee how thou owest vnto me , euen thine owne selfe besides :
Yea , brother , let mee haue ioy of thee in the Lord : refresh my bowles in the Lord .
Hauing confidence in thy obedience , I wrote vnto thee , knowing that thou wilt also doe more then I say .
But withall prepare mee also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be giuen vnto you .
There salute thee Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Iesus :
Marcus , Aristarchus , Demas , Lucas , my fellow labourers .

To giue subtiltie to the simple , to the yong man knowledge and discretion .
A wise man wil heare , and wil increase learning : and a man of vnderstanding shall attaine vnto wise counsels :
To vnderstand a prouerbe , and the interpretation ; the wordes of the wise , and their darke sayings .
¶ The feare of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge : but fooles despise wisedome and instruction .
My sonne , heare the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the law of thy mother .
For they shall be an ornament of grace vnto thy head , and chaines about thy necke .
¶ My sonne , if sinners entise thee , consent thou not .
If they say , Come with vs , let vs lay wait for blood , let vs lurke priuily for the innocent without cause :
Let vs swallow them vp aliue , as the graue , and whole , as those that goe downe into the pit :
Wee shall finde all precious substance , wee shall fill our houses with spoile :
Cast in thy lot among vs , let vs all haue one purse :
My sonne , walke not thou in the way with them ; refraine thy foot from their path :
For their feete runne to euil , and make haste to shed blood .
Surely in vaine the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
And they lay wait for their owne blood , they lurke priuily for their owne liues .

Turne you at my reproofe : behold , I will powre out my spirit vnto you , I will make knowen my wordes vnto you .
¶ Because I haue called , and yee refused , I haue stretched out my hand , and no man regarded :
But ye haue set at nought all my counsell , & would none of my reproofe :
I also will laugh at your calamitie , I wil mocke when your feare commeth .
When your feare commeth as desolation , and your destruction commeth as a whirlewinde ; when distresse and anguish commeth vpon you :
Then shall they call vpon mee , but I will not answere ; they shall seeke me early , but they shall not finde me :
For that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the feare of the Lord .
They would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproofe .
Therefore shall they eate of the fruite of their owne way , and be filled with their owne deuices .
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of fooles shall destroy them .

If thou seekest her as siluer , and searchest for her , as for hid treasures :
To deliuer thee from the way of the euill man , from the man that speaketh froward things .
Who leaue the pathes of vprightnesse , to walke in the wayes of darkenesse : Who reioyce to doe euill , and delight in the frowardnesse of the wicked .
Whose wayes are crooked , and they froward in their pathes .
To deliuer thee from the strange woman , euen from the stranger , which flattereth with her words :
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth , and forgetteth the couenant of her God .
<NON-VERSE>
My sonne , forget not my lawe ; but let thine heart keepe my commaundements :
For length of dayes , and long life , and peace shall they adde to thee .
Let not mercy and trueth forsake thee : bind them about thy necke , write them vpon the table of thine heart . So shalt thou find fauour , and good vnderstanding in the sight of God , and man .
¶ Trust in the Lord with all thine heart ; and leaue not vnto thine owne vnderstanding .
In all thy wayes acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy pathes .
¶ Be not wise in thine owne eyes : feare the Lord , and depart from euill .
It shalbe health to thy nauill , and marrow to thy bones .
Honour the Lord with thy substance , and with the first fruits of all thine increase .
So shall thy barnes be filled with plenty , and thy presses shall burst out with new wine .
¶ My sonne , despise not the chastening of the Lord : neither be weary of his correction .
For whom the Lord loueth , he correcteth , euen as a father the sonne , in whom he delighteth .
She is more precious then Rubies : and all the things thou canst desire , are not to be compared vnto her .
Length of dayes is in her right hand : and in her left hand , riches and honour .
Her wayes are wayes of plesantnesse : and all her pathes are peace .
She is a tree of life , to them that lay hold vpon her : and happy is euery one that retaineth her .
The Lord by wisedome hath founded the earth ; by vnderstanding hath he established the heauens .
By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp ; and the cloudes droppe downe the dew .
¶ My sonne , let not them depart from thine eyes : keepe sound wisedome and discretion .
So shall they bee life vnto thy soule , and grace to thy necke .
Then shalt thou walke in thy way safely , & thy foot shall not stumble .
When thou lyest downe , thou shalt not be afraide : yea , thou shalt lye downe , and thy sleepe shalbe sweet .
Be not afraid of sudden feare , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it commeth .
For the Lord shalbe thy confidence , and shall keepe thy foote from being taken . ¶ Withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thine hand to doe it .
Say not vnto thy neighbour , Goe , and come againe , and to morrow I will giue , when thou hast it by thee . Deuise not euil against thy neighbour , seeing hee dwelleth securely by thee .
¶ Striue not with a man without cause , if hee haue done thee no harme .
¶ Enuie thou not the oppressour , and choose none of his wayes .
For the froward is abomination to the Lord : but his secret is with the righteous .
¶ The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the iust . Surely he scorneth the scorners : but he giueth grace vnto the lowly .

He taught me also , and said vnto me , Let thine heart reteine my wordes : keepe my commandements , and liue .
Get wisedome , get vnderstanding : forget it not , neither decline from the wordes of my mouth .
Forsake her not , and she shall preserue thee : loue her , and she shall keepe thee .
She shall giue to thine head an ornament of grace , a crowne of glory shall she deliuer to thee .
Heare , O my sonne , and receiue my sayings : and the yeeres of thy life shalbe many .
I haue taught thee in the way of wisedome : I haue lead thee in right pathes .
When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitned , and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
Take fast hold of instruction , let her not goe ; keepe her , for she is thy life .
¶ Enter not into the path of the wicked , and goe not in the way of euill men .
Auoid it , passe not by it , turne from it , and passe away .
For they sleepe not except they haue done mischiefe : and their sleepe is taken away vnlesse they cause some to fall .
For they eate the bread of wickednesse , and drinke the wine of violence .
But the path of the iust is as the shining light that shineth more and more vnto the perfect day .
The way of the wicked is as darknes : they know not at what they stumble .
¶ My sonne , attend to my words , incline thine eare vnto my sayings .
Let them not depart from thine eyes : keepe them in the midst of thine heart .
For they are life vnto those that find them , and health to all their flesh .
¶ Keepe thy heart with all diligence : for out of it are the issues of life .
Put away from thee a froward mouth , and peruerse lips put farre from thee .
Let thine eyes looke right on , and let thine eye lids looke straight before thee . Ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy wayes be established .
<NON-VERSE>
My sonne , attend vnto my wisedome , and bowe thine eare to my vnderstanding . That thou mayest regard discretion , and that thy lips may keepe knowledge .
¶ For the lips of a strange woman drop as an hony combe , and her mouth is smoother then oyle .
But her end is bitter as wormewood , sharpe as a two edged sword .
Her feete goe downe to death : her steps take hold on hell .
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her wayes are moueable , that thou canst not know them .
Heare me now therefore , O yee children : & depart not from the words of my mouth .
Remoue thy way farre from her , and come not nie the doore of her house :
Lest thou giue thine honour vnto others , and thy yeeres vnto the cruell :
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth , and thy labors be in the house of a stranger ,
And thou mourne at the last , when thy flesh and thy body are consumed , And say , How haue I hated instruction , and my heart despised reproofe ?
And haue not obeyed the voyce of my teachers , nor inclined mine eare to them that instructed me ?
Let thy fountaines bee dispersed abroad , and riuers of waters in the streets .
Let them be onely thine owne , and not strangers with thee .
Let thy fountaine be blessed : and reioyce with the wife of thy youth .
Let her bee as the louing Hinde and pleasant Roe , let her breasts satisfie thee at all times , and be thou rauisht alwayes with her loue .
And why wilt thou , my sonne , be rauisht with a strange woman , and imbrace the bosome of a stranger ?
For the wayes of man are before the eyes of the Lord , and he pondereth all his goings .
¶ His owne iniquities shall take the wicked himselfe , and he shall be holden with the coards of his sinnes .
<NON-VERSE>
My sonne , if thou bee surety for thy friend , it thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger ,
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth , thou art taken with the wordes of thy mouth .
Doe this now , my sonne , and deliuer thy selfe , when thou art come into the hand of thy friend : goe , humble thy selfe , and make sure thy friend . Giue not sleepe to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids .
Deliuer thy selfe as a Roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
¶ Goe to the Ant , thou sluggard , consider her wayes , and be wise .
Which hauing no guide , ouerseer , or ruler ,
Prouideth her meat in the Summer , and gathereth her food in the haruest .
How long wilt thou sleepe , O sluggard ? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleepe ?
Yet a little sleepe , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleepe .
So shall thy pouertie come as one that trauaileth , and thy want as an armed man .
¶ A naughtie person , a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth .
He winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feete , hee teacheth with his fingers .
Frowardnesse is in his heart , he deuiseth mischiefe continually , he soweth discord .
Therefore shall his calamitie come suddenly ; suddenly shall hee be broken without remedie .
¶ These sixe things doeth the Lord hate ; yea seuen are an abomination vnto him :
A false witnesse that speaketh lies ; and him that soweth discord among brethren .
¶ My sonne , keepe thy fathers commandement , and forsake not the law of thy mother .
Binde them continually vpon thine heart , and tie them about thy necke .
When thou goest , it shall leade thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keepe thee ; and when thou awakest , it shall talke with thee .
For the Commandement is a lampe , and the Lawe is light : and reproofes of instruction are the way of life :
To keepe thee from the euill woman , from the flatterie of the tongue of a strange woman .
Lust not after her beautie in thine heart ; neither let her take thee with her eyelids .
For by meanes of a whorish woman , a man is brought to a piece of bread : and the adulteresse will hunt for the precious life .
Can a man take fire in his bosome , and his clothes not be burnt ?
Can one goe vpon hote coales , and his feete not be burnt ?
So he that goeth in to his neighbours wife ; whosoeuer toucheth her , shall not be innocent .
Men doe not despise a thiefe , if he steale to satisfie his soule , when hee is hungry :
But if he be found , he shall restore seuenfold , he shall giue all the substance of his house .
But who so committeth adultery with a woman , lacketh vnderstanding : hee that doeth it , destroyeth his owne soule .
A wound and dishonour shall he get , and his reproch shall not be wiped away .
For iealousie is the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
Keepe my commandements , and liue : and my law as the apple of thine eye .
Bind them vpon thy fingers , write them vpon the table of thine heart .
Say vnto Wisedome , Thou art my sister , and call Understanding thy kinse woman ,
And behelde among the simple ones , I discerned among the youths , a yong man void of vnderstanding ,
Passing through the streete neere her corner , and he went the way to her house ,
Now is shee without , now in the streetes , and lieth in waite at euery corner . )
So she caught him , and kissed him , and with an impudent face , said vnto him ,
I haue peace offerings with me : this day haue I paid my vowes .
Therefore came I forth to meete thee , diligently to seeke thy face , and I haue found thee .
I haue deckt my bed with couerings of tapestrie , with carued workes , with fine linnen of Egypt .
I haue perfumed my bed with myrrhe , aloes , and cynamom .
Come , let vs take our fill of loue vntill the morning , let vs solace our selues with loues .
For the good - man is not at home , he is gone a long iourney .
He hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
With much faire speech she caused him to yeeld , with the flattering of her lips she forced him .
He goeth after her straightway , as an oxe goeth to the slaughter , or as a foole to the correction of the stocks ,
Til a dart strike through his liuer , as a bird hasteth to the snare , and knoweth not that it is for his life .
¶ Hearken vnto me now therefore , O ye children , and attend to the words of my mouth .
Let not thine heart decline to her wayes , goe not astray in her paths .
For shee hath cast downe many wounded : yea many strong men haue bene slaine by her .

Doeth not Wisedome crie ? & Understanding put foorth her voice ?
Shee standeth in the top of high places , by the way in the places of the pathes .
All the words of my mouth are in righteousnes , there is nothing froward or peruerse in them .
They are all plaine to him that vnderstandeth : and right to them that find knowledge .
Receiue my instruction , and not siluer : and knowledge rather then choise gold .
For wisedome is better then rubies : and all the things that may be desired , are not to be compared to it .
I wisedome dwell with prudence , and find out knowledge of witty inuentions .
The feare of the Lord is to hate euill : pride and arrogancie , and the euill way , and the froward mouth doe I hate .
Counsell is mine , and sound wisedome : I am vnderstanding , I haue strength . By me kings reigne , and princes decree iustice .
By me Princes rule , and Nobles , euen all the Iudges of the earth .
I loue them that loue me , and those that seeke me early , shall find me .
Riches and honour are with me , yea durable riches and righteousnesse .
My fruite is better then gold , yea then fine gold , and my reuenue then choise siluer .
I leade in the way of righteousnesse , in the midst of the pathes of iudgment .
That I may cause those that loue me , to inherite substance : and I will fill their treasures .
The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
I was set vp from euerlasting , from the beginning , or euer the earth was .
When there were no depthes , I was brought forth : when there were no fountaines abounding with water .
Before the mountaines were setled : before the hilles , was I brought foorth :
While as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the highest part of the dust of the world .
When hee prepared the heauens , I was there : when he set a compasse vpon the face of the depth .
When he established the cloudes aboue : when he strengthned the fountaines of the deepe .
When he gaue to the sea his decree , that the waters should not passe his commandement : when he appointed the foundations of the earth :
Then I was by him , as one brought vp with him : and I was daily his delight , reioycing alwayes before him :
Reioycing in the habitable part of his earth , and my delights were with the sonnes of men .
Nowe therefore hearken vnto me , O yee children : for blessed are they that keepe my wayes .
Heare instruction , and bee wise , and refuse it not .
Blessed is the man that heareth me : watching daily at my gates , waiting at the postes of my doores .
For whoso findeth mee , findeth life , and shall obtaine fauour of the Lord .

She hath sent forth her maidens ; she cryeth vpon the highest places of the citie .

The rod and reproofe giue wisedome : but a child left to himselfe bringeth his mother to shame .
When the wicked are multiplied , transgression increaseth : but the righteous shall see their fall .
Correct thy sonne , and hee shall giue thee rest : yea he shall giue delight vnto thy soule .
Where there is no vision , the people perish : but he that keepeth the Law , happy is he .
A seruant will not be corrected by words : for though hee vnderstand , hee will not answere .
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words ? there is more hope of a foole then of him .
He that delicately bringeth vp his seruant from a child , shall haue him become his sonne at the length . An angry man stirreth vp strife , and a furious man aboundeth in transgression .
A mans pride shall bring him lowe : but honour shall vpholde the humble in spirit .
Who so is partner with a thiefe , hateth his owne soule : hee heareth cursing , and bewrayeth it not .
The feare of man bringeth a snare : but who so putteth his trust in the Lord , shall be safe .
Many seeke the rulers fauour , but euery mans iudgement commeth from the Lord .
Surely I am more brutish then any man , and haue not the vnderstanding of a man .
I neither learned wisedome , nor haue the knowledge of the holy .
Who hath ascended vp into heauen , or descended ? who hath gathered the wind in his fists ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? what is his name , and what is his sonnes name , if thou canst tell ?
Euery word of God is pure : he is a shield vnto them that put their trust in him .
Adde thou not vnto his words , lest he reproue thee , and thou be found a lyar .
Two things haue I required of thee , deny me them not before I die .
Remoue farre from mee vanity , and lyes ; giue me neither pouerty , nor riches , feede me with food conuenient for me .
Lest I be full , and deny thee , and say , Who is the Lord ? or lest I be poore , and steale , and take the name of my God in vaine .
Accuse not a seruant vnto his master ; lest he curse thee , and thou be found guilty .
There is a generation that curseth their father , and doth not blesse their mother .
There is a generation that are pure in their owne eyes , and yet is not washed from their filthinesse .
There is a generation , O howe lofty are their eyes ! and their eye - lids are lifted vp .
There is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their iaw - teeth as kniues , to deuoure the poore from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
The horse - leach hath two daughters , crying , Giue , giue . There are three things that are neuer satisfied , yea foure things say not , It is enough :
The graue ; and the barren wombe ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , It is enough .
The eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his mother ; the rauens of the valley shall picke it out , and the young Eagles shall eate it .
There be three things which are too wonderfull for me ; yea foure , which I know not :
The way of an Eagle in the ayre ; the way of a serpent vpon a rocke ; the the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
Such is the way of an adulterous woman : she eateth , and wipeth her mouth , and saith , I haue done no wickednesse .
For three things the earth is disquieted , and for foure which it cannot beare :
For a seruant when he reigneth , and a foole when hee is filled with meate :
For an odious woman when shee is married , and an handmayd that is heire to her mistresse .
The conies are but a feeble folke , yet make they their houses in the rocks
The locustes haue no king , yet goe they forth all of them by bands .
The spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings palaces .
There be three things which goe well , yea foure are comely in going :
A lyon which is strongest among beastes , and turneth not away for any :
A gray - hound ; an hee - goate also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising vp .
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting vp thy selfe , or if thou hast thought euill , lay thine hand vpon thy mouth .

The wordes of King Lemuel , the prophecie that his mother taught him .
What , my sonne ! and what , the sonne of my wombe ! and what , the sonne of my vowes !
Giue not thy strength vnto women , nor thy wayes to that which destroyeth kings .
It is not for kings , O Lemuel , it is not for kings to drinke wine , nor for Princes , strong drinke :
Let him drinke , and forget his pouertie , and remember his misery no more .
Open thy mouth for the dumbe in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction .
Open thy mouth , iudge righteously , and plead the cause of the poore and needy .
She will doe him good , and not euill , all the dayes of her life .
She considereth a field , and buyeth it : with the fruit of her handes she planteth a Uineyard . She girdeth her loynes with strength , and strengtheneth her armes .
She perceiueth that her merchandise is good ; her candle goeth not out by night .
She layeth her handes to the spindle , and her handes hold the distaffe .
She stretcheth out her hand to the poore , yea she reacheth foorth her handes to the needy . She is not afraid of the snow for her houshold : for all her houshold are cloathed with scarlet .
She maketh herselfe couerings of tapestrie ; her cloathing is silke and purple .
Her husband is knowen in the gates , when he sitteth among the Elders of the land . She maketh fine linnen , and selleth it , and deliuereth girdles vnto the merchant .
Strength and honour are her cloathing ; and she shall reioyce in time to come . She openeth her mouth with wisedome ; and in her tongue is the law of kindnesse .
She looketh well to the wayes of her housholde , and eateth not the bread of idlenesse .
Her children arise vp , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
Many daughters haue done vertuously , but thou excellest them all .
Fauour is deceitfull , and beautie is vaine : but a woman that feareth the Lord , she shalbe praised .
<NON-VERSE>
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsell of the vngodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornefull .
But his delight is in the Law of the Lord , and in his Law doeth he meditate day and night .
And he shalbe like a tree planted by the riuers of water , that bringeth foorth his fruit in his season , his leafe also shall not wither , and whatsoeuer he doeth , shall prosper .
The vngodly are not so : but are like the chaffe , which the winde driueth away .
Therefore the vngodly shall not stand in the iudgement , nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous .
<NON-VERSE>
Why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vaine thing ?
The Kings of the earth set themselues , and the rulers take counsell together , against the Lord , and against his Anoynted , saying ,
Let vs breake their bandes asunder , and cast away their cords from vs .
Hee that sitteth in the heauens shal laugh : the Lord shall haue them in derision .
Then shall hee speake vnto them in his wrath , and vexe them in his sore displeasure .
Yet haue I set my King vpon my holy hill of Sion .
I will declare the decree : the Lord hath said vnto mee , Thou art my sonne , this day haue I begotten thee .
Aske of me , and I shall giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the vttermost parts of the earth for thy possession .
Thou shalt breake them with a rod of iron , thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessell .
Bee wise now therefore , O yee Kings : be instructed ye Iudges of the earth .
Serue the Lord with feare , and reioyce with trembling .
<NON-VERSE>
Lord , how are they increased that trouble mee ? many are they that rise vp against me .
Many there bee which say of my soule , There is no helpe for him in God . Selah .
But thou , O Lord , art a shield for me ; my glory , and the lifter vp of mine head .
I cryed vnto the Lord with my voyce , and he heard me out of his holy hill . Selah .
I layd me downe and slept ; I awaked , for the Lord sustained me .
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that haue set themselues against me round about .
Arise , O Lord , saue mee , O my God ; for thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone : thou hast broken the teeth of the vngodly .
<NON-VERSE>
Heare me , when I call , O God of my righteousnesse : thou hast inlarged mee when I was in distresse , haue mercy vpon me , and heare my prayer .
O ye sonnes of men , how long will yee turne my glory into shame ? how long will yee loue vanitie , and seeke after leasing ? Selah .
But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly , for himselfe : the Lord will heare when I call vnto him .
Stand in awe , and sinne not : commune with your owne heart vpon your bed , and be still . Selah .
Offer the sacrifices of righteousnesse , and put your trust in the Lord .
There be many that say , Who wil shew vs any good ? Lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs .
Thou hast put gladnesse in my heart , more then in the time that their corne and their wine increased .
<NON-VERSE>
My voyce shalt thou heare in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my prayer vnto thee , and will looke vp .
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickednesse : neither shall euill dwell with thee .
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest al workers of iniquity
Thou shalt destroy them that speake leasing : the Lord will abhorre the bloodie and deceitfull man .
But as for me , I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy : and in thy feare will I worship toward thy holy temple .
Lead me O Lord , in thy righteousnesse , because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
For there is no faithfulnes in their mouth , their inward part is very wickednesse : their throat is an open sepulchre , they flatter with their tongue .
Destroy thou them , O God , let them fall by their owne counsels : cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions , for they haue rebelled against thee .
But let all those that put their trust in thee , reioyce : let them euer shout for ioy ; because thou defendest them : let them also that loue thy name , be ioyfull in thee .
<NON-VERSE>
My soule is also sore vexed : but thou , O Lord , how long ?
Returne , O Lord , deliuer my soule : oh saue mee , for thy mercies sake .
For in death there is no remembrance of thee : in the graue who shall giue thee thankes ?
I am weary with my groning , all the night make I my bed to swim : I water my couch with my teares .
Mine eie is consumed because of griefe ; it waxeth olde because of all mine enemies .
Depart from me , all yee workers of iniquitie : for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping .
The Lord hath heard my supplication ; the Lord will receiue my prayer .
<NON-VERSE>
O Lord , my God , in thee doe I put my trust : saue me from all them that persecute me , and deliuer me .
Least hee teare my soule like a lyon , renting it in pieces , while there is none to deliuer .
O Lord my God , if I haue done this ; if there be iniquitie in my hands :
If I haue rewarded euill vnto him that was at peace with me : ( yea I haue deliuered him that without cause is mine enemie . )
Let the enemie persecute my soule , and take it , yea let him tread downe my life vpon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust . Selah .
Arise , O Lord , in thine anger , lift vp thy selfe , because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the iudgement that thou hast commanded .
So shall the congregation of the people compasse thee about : for their sakes therefore returne thou on high .
The Lord shal iudge the people : iudge me , O Lord , according to my righteousnesse , and according to mine integritie that is in me .
God iudgeth the righteous , and God is angrie with the wicked euery - day .
If he turne not , he will whet his sword ; he hath bent his bowe , and made it ready .
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he ordaineth his arrowes against the persecutors .
Behold , he trauelleth with iniquitie , and hath conceiued mischiefe , and brought forth falshood .
He made a pit and digged it , and is fallen into the ditch which he made .
His mischiefe shall returne vpon his owne head , and his violent dealing shall come downe vpon his owne pate .
<NON-VERSE>
O Lord our Lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth ! who hast set thy glory aboue the heauens .
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength , because of thine enemies , that thou mightest still the enemie and the auenger .
When I consider thy heauens , the worke of thy fingers , the moone and the starres which thou hast ordained ;
Thou madest him to haue dominion ouer the workes of thy hands ; thou hast put all things vnder his feete .
All sheepe and oxen , yea and the beasts of the field .
The foule of the aire , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoeuer passeth through the paths of the seas .
<NON-VERSE>
I wil praise thee , O Lord , with my whole heart : I will shewe foorth all thy maruellous workes .
I will bee glad and reioyce in thee : I will sing prayse to thy name , O thou most High .
And hee shall iudge the world in righteousnesse ; he shall minister iudgement to the people in vprightnesse .
The Lord also will bee a refuge for the oppressed : a refuge , in times of trouble .
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou Lord hast not forsaken them that seeke thee .
Sing praises to the Lord , which dwelleth in Sion : declare among the people his doings .
When he maketh inquisition for blood , he remembreth them : he forgetteth not the crie of the humble .
Haue mercie vpon me O Lord , consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me , thou that liftest mee vp from the gates of death :
That I may shew foorth all thy prayse in the gates of the daughter of Sion : I will reioyce in thy saluation .
The heathen are sunke downe in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid , is their own foot taken .
The Lord is knowen by the iudgement which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne hands . Higgaion . Selah .
The wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God .
For the needie shall not alway be forgotten : the expectation of the poore shall not perish for euer .
Arise , O Lord , let not man preuaile : let the heathen bee iudged in thy sight .
<NON-VERSE>
For the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire , and blesseth the couetous , whom the Lord abhorreth .
The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seeke after God : God is not in all his thoughts .
His wayes are alwayes grieuous , thy iudgements are farre aboue out of his sight : as for all his enemies , he puffeth at them .
He hath said in his heart , I shall not be moued : for I shall neuer be in aduersitie .
His mouth is full of cursing , and deceit , and fraud : vnder his tongue is mischiefe and vanitie .
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doeth he murder the innocent : his eyes are priuily set against the poore .
He lieth in waite secretly as a lyon in his denne , he lieth in wait to catch the poore : he doth catch the poore when he draweth him into his net .
He croucheth , and humbleth himselfe , that the poore may fall by his strong ones .
Hee hath said in his heart , God hath forgotten : he hideth his face , hee will neuer see it .
Arise , O Lord , O God lift vp thine hand : forget not the humble .
Wherefore doeth the wicked contemne God ? he hath said in his heart , Thou wilt not require it .
Thou hast seene it , for thou beholdest mischiefe and spite to requite it with thy hand : the poore committeth himselfe vnto thee , thou art the helper of the fatherlesse .
Breake thou the arme of the wicked , and the euill man : seeke out his wickednes , till thou finde none .
The Lord is King for euer and euer : the heathen are perished out of his land .
Lord , thou hast heard the desire of the humble : thou wilt prepare their heart , thou wilt cause thine eare to heare ,

In the Lord put I my trust : how say yee to my soule , Flee as a bird to your mountaine ?
For loe , the wicked bende their bow , they make ready their arrow vpon the string : that they may priuily shoote at the vpright in heart .
If the foundations bee destroyed : what can the righteous doe ?
The Lord is in his holy Temple , the Lords Throne is in heauen : his eyes beholde , his eye lids trie the children of men .
The Lord trieth the righteous : but the wicked and him that loueth violence , his soule hateth .
Upon the wicked hee shall raine snares , fire and brimstone , and an horrible tempest : this shall be the portion of their cup .
<NON-VERSE>
Helpe Lord , for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithfull faile from among the children of men .
They speake vanitie euery one with his neighbour : with flattering lips , and with a double heart do they speake . The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that speaketh proud things .
Who haue said , with our tongue wil we preuaile , our lips are our owne : who is Lord ouer vs ?
For the oppression of the poore , for the sighing of the needy , now will I arise ( saith the Lord , ) I will set him in safetie from him that puffeth at him .
The wordes of the Lord are pure wordes : as siluer tried in a fornace of earth purified seuen times .
Thou shalt keepe them , ( O Lord , ) thou shalt preserue them , from this generation for euer .
<NON-VERSE>
How long wilt thou forget mee ( O Lord ) for euer ? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me ?
How long shall I take counsel in my soule , hauing sorrow in my heart dayly ? how long shall mine enemie be exalted ouer me ?
Consider and heare me , O Lord my God : lighten mine eyes , lest I sleep the sleepe of death .
Least mine enimie say , I haue preuailed against him : and those that trouble mee , reioyce , when I am moued . But I haue trusted in thy mercy , my heart shall reioyce in thy saluation .
<NON-VERSE>
The foole hath sayd in his heart , There is no God : they are corrupt , they haue done abominable workes , there is none that doeth good .
The Lord looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men ; to see if there were any that did vnderstand and seeke God .
They are all gone aside , they are all together become filthy : there is none that doeth good , no not one .
Haue all the workers of iniquity no knowledge ? who eate vp my people as they eate bread , and call not vpon the Lord .
There were they in great feare ; for God is in the generation of the righteous .
You haue shamed the counsell of the poore ; because the Lord is his refuge .
<NON-VERSE>
Lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
Hee that walketh vprightly , and worketh righteousnesse , and speaketh the trueth in his heart .
Hee that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doth euill to his neighbour , nor taketh vp a reproach against his neighbour .
O my soule , thou hast sayd vnto the Lord , Thou art my Lord : my goodnes extendeth not to thee :
But to the Saints , that are in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom is all my delight .
Their sorrowes shalbe multiplied , that hasten after another God : their drinke offerings of blood will I not offer , nor take vp their names into my lippes .
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance , and of my cup : thou maintainest my lot .
The lines are fallen vnto mee in pleasant places ; yea , I haue a goodly heritage .
I will blesse the Lord , who hath giuen me counsell : my reines also instruct me in the night seasons .
I haue set the Lord alwaies before me : because hee is at my right hand , I shall not be moued .
Therefore my heart is glad , and my glory reioyceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
Heare the right , O Lord , attend vnto my crie , giue eare vnto my prayer , that goeth not out of fained lips .
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence : let thine eyes beholde the things that are equall .
Thou hast prooued mine heart , thou hast visited me in the night , thou hast tried me , and shalt find nothing : I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgresse .
Concerning the workes of men , by the word of thy lips , I haue kept me from the paths of the destroyer .
Hold vp my goings in thy paths , that my footsteps slip not .
I haue called vpon thee , for thou wilt heare me , O God : incline thine eare vnto me , and heare my speach .
Shewe thy marueilous louing kindnesse , O thou that sauest by thy right hand , them which put their trust in thee , from those that rise vp against them .
Keepe me as the apple of the eye : hide mee vnder the shadowe of thy wings ,
From the wicked that oppresse me , from my deadly enemies , who compasse me about .
They are inclosed in their owne fat : with their mouth they speake proudly .
They haue now compassed vs in our steps : they haue set their eyes bowing downe to the earth :
Like as a lyon that is greedie of his pray , and as it were a yong lyon lurking in secret places .
Arise , O Lord , disappoint him , cast him downe : deliuer my soule from the wicked , which is thy sword :
From men which are thy hand , O Lord , from men of the world , which haue their portion in this life , and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure : They are full of children , and leaue the rest of their substance to their babes .
<NON-VERSE>
I will loue thee , O Lord , my strength .
The Lord is my rocke , and my fortresse , and my deliuerer : my God , my strength in whome I will trust , my buckler , and the horne of my saluation , and my high tower .
I will call vpon the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saued from mine enemies .
The sorrowes of death compassed me , and the floods of vngodly men made me afraid .
The sorrowes of hell compassed me about : the snares of death preuented me .
In my distresse I called vpon the Lord , and cryed vnto my God : hee heard my voyce out of his temple , and my crie came before him , euen into his eares .
Then the earth shooke and trembled ; the foundations also of the hilles mooued and were shaken , because hee was wroth .
There went vp a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth deuoured , coales were kindled by it .
He bowed the heauens also , and came downe : and darkenesse was vnder his feet .
And he rode vpon a Cherub , and did flie : yea he did flie vpon the wings of the wind .
He made darkenes his secret place : his pauilion round about him , were darke waters , and thicke cloudes of the skies .
At the brightnes that was before him his thicke clouds passed , haile stones and coales of fire .
The Lord also thundered in the heauens , and the highest gaue his voyce ; hailestones and coales of fire .
Yea , he sent out his arrowes , and scattered them ; and he shot out lightnings , and discomfited them .
He deliuered me from my strong enemie , and from them which hated me : for they were too strong for me .
They preuented me in the day of my calamitie : but the Lord was my stay .
He brought me forth also into a large place : he deliuered me , because he delighted in me .
The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousnesse , according to the cleannesse of my hands hath hee recompensed me .
For I haue kept the wayes of the Lord , and haue not wickedly departed from my God . For all his iudgements were before me , and I did not put away his statutes from me .
I was also vpright before him : and I kept my selfe from mine iniquity .
For thou wilt saue the afflicted people : but wilt bring downe high lookes .
For thou wilt light my candle : the Lord my God will enlighten my darkenesse .
For by thee I haue run through a troupe ? and by my God haue I leaped ouer a wall .
As for God , his way is perfect : the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all those that trust in him .
For who is God saue the Lord ? or who is a rocke saue our God ?
It is God that girdeth mee with strength , and maketh my way perfect .
Hee maketh my feete like hindes feete , and setteth me vpon my high places .
He teacheth my hands to warre , so that a bow of steele is broken by mine armes .
Thou hast also giuen me the shield of thy saluation : and thy right hand hath holden me vp , and thy gentlenesse hath made me great .
Thou hast enlarged my steppes vnder me ; that my feete did not slippe .
I haue pursued mine enemies , and ouertaken them : neither did I turne againe till they were consumed .
I haue wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are fallen vnder my feete .
For thou hast girded mee with strength vnto the battell : thou hast subdued vnder me , those that rose vp against me .
Thou hast also giuen mee the neckes of mine enemies : that I might destroy them that hate me .
They cried , but there was none to saue them : euen vnto the Lord , but he answered them not .
Then did I beate them small as the dust before the winde : I did cast them out , as the dirt in the streetes .
Thou hast deliuered me from the striuings of the people , and thou hast made mee the head of the heathen : a people whom I haue not knowen , shall serue me .
As soone as they heare of mee , they shall obey me : the strangers shall submit themselues vnto me .
The strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
The Lord liueth , and blessed be my rocke : and let the God of my saluation be exalted .
It is God that auengeth mee , and subdueth the people vnder me .
He deliuereth me from mine enemies : yea thou liftest mee vp aboue those that rise vp against me ; thou hast deliuered me from the violent man .
The heauens declare the glory of God : and the firmament sheweth his handy worke .
Their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world : In them hath he set a tabernacle for the Sunne .
Which is as a bridegrome comming out of his chamber , and reioyceth as a strong man to runne a race .
His going forth is from the end of the heauen , and his circuite vnto the ends of it : and there is nothing hidde from the heat thereof .
The Law of the Lord is perfect , conuerting the soule : the testimonie of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple .
The Statutes of the Lord are right , reioycing the heart : the Commandement of the Lord is pure , inlightning the eyes .
The feare of the Lord is cleane , enduring for euer : the Iudgements of the Lord are true , and righteous altogether .
More to bee desired are they then gold , yea , then much fine gold : sweeter also then hony , and the hony combe .
Moreouer by them is thy seruant warned : and in keeping of them there is great reward .
Who can vnderstand his errours ? cleanse thou me from secret faults .
The Lord heare thee in the day of trouble , the Name of the God of Iacob defend thee .
Send thee helpe from the Sanctuary : and strengthen thee out of Sion .
Remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice . Selah .
Graunt thee according to thine owne heart , and fulfill all thy counsell .
We will reioyce in thy saluation , and in the Name of our God we will set vp our banners : the Lord fulfill all thy petitions .
Now know I , that the Lord saueth his Anointed : he wil heare him from his holy heauen , with the sauing strength of his right hand .
Some trust in charets , and some in horses : but wee will remember the Name of the Lord our God .
They are brought downe and fallen : but we are risen , and stand vpright .

The King shall ioy in thy strength , O Lord : and in thy saluation how greatly shall he reioyce ?
Thou hast giuen him his hearts desire ; and hast not withholden the request of his lips . Selah .
For thou preuentest him with the blessings of goodnesse : thou settest a Crowne of pure gold on his head .
He asked life of thee , and thou gauest it him , euen length of dayes for euer and euer .
His glory is great in thy saluation : honour and Maiestie hast thou layde vpon him .
For thou hast made him most blessed for euer : thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance .
For the King trusteth in the Lord , and through the mercy of the most High , he shall not be moued .
Thine hand shall finde out all thine enemies , thy right hand shal finde out those that hate thee .
Thou shalt make them as a fiery ouen in the time of thine anger : the Lord shall swallow them vp in his wrath , and the fire shall deuoure them .
Therefore shalt thou make them turne their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrowes vpon thy strings , against the face of them .

My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken mee ? Why art thou so far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ?
O my God , I crie in the day time , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
But thou art holy , O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel !
Our fathers trusted in thee : they trusted , and thou didst deliuer them .
They cryed vnto thee , and were deliuered : they trusted in thee , and were not confounded .
But I am a worme , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised of the people .
All they that see me , laugh me to scorne : they shoote out the lippe , they shake the head , saying ,
He trusted on the Lord , that he would deliuer him : let him deliuer him , seeing he delighted in him . But thou art hee that tooke mee out of the wombe ; thou didst make me hope , when I was vpon my mothers breasts .
I was cast vpon thee from the wombe : thou art my God from my mothers belly .
They gaped vpon me with their mouthes , as a rauening and a roaring Lyon .
I am powred out like water , and all my bones are out of ioynt : my heart is like waxe , it is melted in the middest of my bowels .
My strength is dried vp like a potsheard : and my tongue cleaueth to my iawes ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death .
For dogges haue compassed me : the assembly of the wicked haue inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feete .
I may tell all my bones : they looke and stare vpon me .
They part my garments among them , and cast lots vpon my vesture .
But be not thou farre from mee , O Lord ; O my strength , hast thee to helpe me .
Deliuer my soule from the sword : my darling from the power of the dogge .
Saue me from the lyons mouth : for thou hast heard me from the hornes of the vnicornes .
I will declare thy name vnto my brethren : in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee .
Yee that feare the Lord , praise him ; all yee the seede of Iacob glorifie him , and feare him all yee the seede of Israel .
For he hath not despised , nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him , but when he cried vnto him , he heard .
My praise shalbe of thee , in the great congregation : I will pay my vowes , before them that feare him .
The meeke shall eate and be satisfied : they shall praise the Lord that seeke him ; your heart shall liue for euer .
All the ends of the world shall remember , and turne vnto the Lord : and all the kinreds of the nations shall worship before thee .
For the kingdome is the Lords : and he is the gouernour among the nations .
All they that be fat vpon earth shall eate and worship : all they that goe downe to the dust shall bow before him , and none can keepe aliue his owne soule .
The Lord is my shepheard , I shall not want . He maketh me to lie downe in greene pastures : he leadeth mee beside the still waters .
He restoreth my soule : he leadeth me in the pathes of righteousnes , for his names sake .
Yea though I walke through the valley of the shadowe of death , I will feare no euill : for thou art with me , thy rod and thy staffe , they comfort me .
Thou preparest a table before me , in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oyle , my cuppe runneth ouer .

He that hath cleane hands , and a pure heart ; who hath not lift vp his soule vnto vanitie , nor sworne deceitfully .

Shewe mee thy wayes , O Lord : teach me thy pathes .
Lead me in thy trueth , and teach me : for thou art the God of my saluation , on thee doe I waite all the day .
Remember , O Lord , thy tender mercies , and thy louing kindnesses : for they haue beene euer of old .
Remember not the sinnes of my youth , nor my transgressions : according to thy mercie remember thou me , for thy goodnesse sake , O Lord .

The meeke will he guide in iudgement : and the meeke will he teach his way .
All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth : vnto such as keepe his couenant , and his testimonies .
For thy names sake , O Lord , pardon mine iniquitie : for it is great .

His soule shall dwell at ease : and his seede shall inherite the earth .
The secret of the Lord is with them that feare him : and he will shew them his couenant .
Mine eyes are euer towards the Lord : for hee shall plucke my feete out of the net .

Lord , I haue loued the habitation of thy house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth .
Gather not my soule with sinners , nor my life with bloody men .
In whose hands is mischiefe : and their right hand is full of bribes .
The Lord is my light , and my saluation , whome shal I feare ? the Lord is the strength of my life , of whom shall I be afraid ?
When the wicked , euen mine enemies and my foes came vpon me to eat vp my flesh , they stumbled and fell .
Though an host should encampe against me , my heart shall not feare : though warre should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
One thing haue I desired of the Lord , that will I seeke after : that I may dwel in the house of the Lord , all the dayes of my life , to behold the beautie of the Lord , and to inquire in his temple .
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pauilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me , hee shall set me vp vpon a rocke .
And now shall mine head be lifted vp aboue mine enemies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of ioy , I will sing , yea , I will sing praises vnto the Lord .
Heare , O Lord , when I crie with my voice : haue mercie also vpon mee , and answere me .
When thou saidst , Seeke ye my face , my heart said vnto thee , Thy face , Lord , will I seeke .
Hide not thy face farre from me , put not thy seruant away in anger : thou hast bin my helpe , leaue me not , neither forsake me , O God of my saluation .
When my father and my mother forsake me , then the Lord will take me vp .
Teach me thy way , O Lord , and leade me in a plaine path , because of mine enemies .

Heare the voyce of my supplications , when I cry vnto thee : when I lift vp my handes toward thy holy Oracle .
Draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of iniquitie : which speake peace to their neighbors , but mischiefe is in their hearts .
Giue them according to their deedes , and according to the wickednes of their endeuours : giue them after the worke of their handes , render to them their desert .
Because they regard not the workes of the Lord , nor the operation of his hands , he shal destroy them , and not build them vp .
Blessed be the Lord , because he hath heard the voyce of my supplications .
The Lord is my strength , and my shield , my heart trusted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly reioyceth , and with my song will I praise him .

Lord , by thy fauour thou hast made my mountaine to stand strong : Thou didst hide thy face , and I was troubled .
I cried to thee , O Lord : and vnto the Lord I made supplication .

Haue mercy vpon me , O Lord , for I am in trouble ; mine eie is consumed with griefe , yea my soule and my belly .
For my life is spent with griefe , and my yeeres with sighing : my strength faileth , because of mine iniquitie , and my bones are consumed .
I was a reproch among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a feare to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without , fled from me .
I am forgotten as a dead man out of minde : I am like a broken vessell .
For I haue heard the slaunder of many , feare was on euery side : while they tooke counsell together against me , they deuised to take away my life .

The counsaile of the Lord standeth for euer , the thoughts of his heart to all generations .
Blessed is the nation , whose God is the Lord : and the people , whom he hath chosen for his owne inheritance . The Lord looketh from heauen : he beholdeth all the sonnes of men .

He fashioneth their hearts alike : he considereth all their workes . There is no king saued by the multitude of an hoste : a mightie man is not deliuered by much strength .

He keepeth all his bones : not one of them is broken .
Plead my cause ( O Lord ) with them that striue with mee : fight against them that fight against me .
Take hold of shield and buckler , and stand vp for mine helpe .
Draw out also the speare , and stop the way against them that persecute me : say vnto my soule , I am thy saluation .
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seeke after my soule : let them be turned backe and brought to confusion , that deuise my hurt .

Let their way be darke and slippery , and let the Angel of the Lord persecute them .
For without cause haue they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they haue digged for my soule .
Let destruction come vpon him at vnawares , and let his net that hee hath hid , catch himselfe : into that very destruction let him fall .
And my soule shalbe ioyfull in the Lord : it shall reioyce in his saluation .
All my bones shall say , Lord , who is like vnto thee which deliuerest the poore from him that is too strong for him , yea the poore and the needy , from him that spoileth him ?
False witnesses did rise vp they layd to my charge things that I knew not .
They rewarded mee euill for good , to the spoiling of my soule .
But as for me , when they were sicke , my clothing was sack - cloth : I humbled my soule with fasting , and my prayer returned into mine owne bosome .
I behaued my selfe as though he had bene my friend , or brother : I bowed downe heauily , as one that mourneth for his mother .
But in mine aduersitie they reioyced , and gathered themselues together : yea , the abiects gathered themselues together against me , & I knew it not , they did teare me , and ceased not ,
With hypocriticall mockers in feasts : they gnashed vpon mee with their teeth .
Lord , how long wilt thou looke on ? rescue my soule from their destructions , my darling from the lyons .
I will giue thee thankes in the great congregation : I will praise thee among much people .
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully , reioyce ouer me : neither let them winke with the eye , that hate me without a cause .
For they speake not peace : but they deuise deceitfull matters against them that are quiet in the land .
Yea they opened their mouth wide against me , and saide , Aha , Aha , our eye hath seene it .
Iudge me O Lord my God , according to thy righteousnesse , and let them not reioyce ouer me .
Let them not say in their hearts , Ah , so would we haue it : let them not say , We haue swallowed him vp .
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together , that reioyce at mine hurt : let them bee cloathed with shame and dishonour , that magnifie themselues against me .
Let them shoute for ioy , and bee glad that fauour my righteous cause : yea let them say continually , Let the Lord bee magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his seruant
The words of his mouth are iniquitie and deceit : he hath left off to bee wise , and to doe good .
Hee deuiseth mischiefe vpon his bed , he setteth himselfe in a way that is not good ; he abhorreth not euill .
Thy mercie ( O Lord ) is in the heauens ; and thy faithfulnesse reacheth vnto the cloudes .
Thy righteousnesse is like the great mountaines ; thy iudgements are a great deepe ; O Lord , thou preseruest man and beast .
How excellent is thy louing kindnesse , O God ! therefore the children of men put their trust vnder the shadowe of thy wings .
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatnesse of thy house : and thou shalt make them drinke of the riuer of thy pleasures .
For with thee is the fountaine of life : in thy light shall we see light .
O continue thy louing kindnesse vnto them that know thee ; and thy righteousnesse to the vpright in heart .
Let not the foot of pride come against me , and let not the hand of the wicked remoue me .

Wait on the Lord , and keepe his way , and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land : when the wicked are cut off , thou shalt see it .
I haue seene the wicked in great power : and spreading himselfe like a greene bay tree .
Yet he passed away , and loe he was not : yea , I sought him , but hee could not be found .

For I said , heare me , least otherwise they should reioyce ouer me : when my foot slippeth , they magnifie themselues against me . For I am ready to halt , and my sorrow is continually before me .

My heart was hot within mee , while I was musing the fire burned : then spake I with my tongue .
Lord , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my dayes , what it is : that I may know how fraile I am .
Behold , thou hast made my dayes as an hand breadth , and mine age is as nothing before thee : verily euery man at his best state is altogether vanitie . Selah .
Surely euery man walketh in a vaine shew : surely they are disquieted in vaine : he heapeth vp riches , and knoweth not who shall gather them .
And now Lord , what wait I for ? my hope is in thee .
Deliuer me from all my transgressions : make mee not the reproch of the foolish .
I was dumbe , I opened not my mouth ; because thou diddest it .

Many , O Lord my God ; are thy wonderfull workes which thou hast done , and thy thoughts , which are to vs ward : they cannot be reckoned vp in order vnto thee : if I would declare and speake of them , they are moe then can be numbred .
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire , mine eares hast thou opened : burnt offering and sinne - offering hast thou not required .
Then sayd I , Loe , I come : in the volume of the booke it is written of me :
I delight to doe thy will , O my God : yea thy lawe is within my heart .
I haue preached righteousnesse in the great congregation : loe , I haue not refrained my lippes , O Lord , thou knowest .

With - hold not thou thy tender mercies from me , O Lord : let thy louing kindnesse , and thy trueth continually preserue me .
For innumerable euils haue compassed me about , mine iniquities haue taken hold vpon me , so that I am not able to looke vp : they are moe then the haires of mine head , therefore my heart faileth me .
Be pleased , O Lord , to deliuer me : O Lord , make haste to helpe me .
Let them be ashamed and confounded together , that seeke after my soule to destroy it : let them be driuen backward , and put to shame , that wish me euill .
Let them be desolate , for a reward on their shame , that say vnto me , Aha , aha !
Let all those that seeke thee , reioyce and bee glad in thee : let such as loue thy saluation , say continually , The Lord be magnified .

I sayd , Lord be mercifull vnto me , heale my soule , for I haue sinned against thee . Mine enemies speake euill of me : when shall hee die , and his name perish ?
And if hee come to see me , he speaketh vanity : his heart gathereth iniquitie to it selfe , when he goeth abroad , he telleth it .
All that hate me , whisper together against me ; against me doe they deuise my hurt .
An euill disease , say they , cleaueth fast vnto him ; and now that he lyeth , he shall rise vp no more .

When I remember these things , I powre out my soule in mee ; for I had gone with the multitude , I went with them to the house of God ; with the voyce of ioy and praise , with a multitude that kept holy day .
Why art thou cast downe , O my soule , and why art thou disquieted in me ? hope thou in God , for I shall yet praise him for the helpe of his countenance .
O my God , my soule is cast downe within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Iordane , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Missar .
Deepe calleth vnto deepe at the noyse of thy water - spouts : all thy waues , and thy billowes are gone ouer me .
Yet the Lord will command his louing kindnes in the day time , and in the night his song shalbe with me , and my prayer vnto the God of my life .
I will say vnto God , My rocke , why hast thou forgotten me ? why goe I mourning , because of the oppression of the enemy ?
As with a sword in my bones , mine enemies reproch mee : while they say dayly vnto me , Where is thy God ?

Iudge mee , O God , and plead my cause against an vngodly nation ; O deliuer me from the deceitfull and vniust man .
For thou art the God of my strength , why doest thou cast me off ? why goe I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
O send out thy light & thy trueth ; let them leade mee , let them bring mee vnto thy holy hill , and to thy Tabernacles .
Then will I goe vnto the Altar of God , vnto God my exceeding ioy : yea vpon the harpe will I praise thee , O God , my God .
<NON-VERSE>
Wee haue heard with our eares , O God , our fathers haue told vs , what worke thou didst in their dayes , in the times of old .
How thou didst driue out the heathen with thy hand , & plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
For they got not the land in possession by their owne sword , neither did their owne arme saue them : but thy right hand , and thine arme , and the light of thy countenance , because thou hadst a fauour vnto them .
Thou art my King , O God : command deliuerances for Iacob .
Through thee will wee push downe our enemies : through thy Name will wee tread them vnder that rise vp against vs .
For I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword saue me .
But thou hast saued vs from our enemies , and hast put them to shame that hated vs .
In God we boast all the day long : and praise thy Name for euer . Selah .
But thou hast cast off and put vs to shame ; and goest not forth with our armies .
Thou makest vs to turne backe from the enemie : and they which hate vs , spoile for themselues .
Thou hast giuen vs like sheepe appointed for meate : and hast scattered vs among the heathen .
Thou sellest thy people for nought , and doest not increase thy wealth by their price .
Thou makest vs a reproch to our neighbours , a scorne and a derision to them that are round about vs .
Thou makest vs a by - word among the heathen : a shaking of the head among the people .
My confusion is continually before me , and the shame of my face hath couered me .
For the voice of him that reproacheth , and blasphemeth : by reason of the enemie and auenger .
All this is come vpon vs ; yet haue wee not forgotten thee , neither haue we dealt falsly in thy couenant .
Our heart is not turned backe : neither haue our steps declined from thy way ,
Though thou hast sore broken vs in the place of dragons , and couered vs with the shadow of death .
If wee haue forgotten the name of our God , or stretched out our hands to a strange God :
Shall not God search this out ? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart .
Yea for thy sake are wee killed all the day long : wee are counted as sheepe for the slaughter .
Awake , why sleepest thou , O Lord ? arise , cast vs not off for euer .
Wherefore hidest thou thy face ? and forgettest our affliction , and our oppression ?
For our soule is bowed downe to the dust ; our belly cleaueth vnto the earth .
<NON-VERSE>
My heart is inditing a good matter : I speake of the things which I haue made , touching the King : my tongue is the penne of a ready writer .
Thou art fairer then the children of men : grace is powred into thy lips : therfore God hath blessed thee for euer .
Gird thy sword vpon thy thigh , O most mightie : with thy glory and thy maiestie .
And in thy maiestie ride prosperously , because of trueth and meekenes , and righteousnesse : and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things .
Thine arrowes are sharpe in the heart of the Kings enemies ; whereby the people fall vnder thee .
Thy throne ( O God ) is for euer and euer : the scepter of thy kingdome is a right scepter .
Thou louest righteousnesse , and hatest wickednesse : therefore God , thy God , hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes .
All thy garments smell of myrrhe , and aloes , and cassia : out of the Iuorie palaces , whereby they haue made thee glad .
Kings daughters were among thy honourable women : vpon thy right hand did stand the Queene in golde of Ophir .
Hearken ( O daughter ) and consider , and incline thine eare ; forget also thine owne people , and thy fathers house .
The kings daughter is all glorious within ; her clothing is of wrought gold .
She shall bee brought vnto the king in raiment of needle worke : the virgins her companions that followe her , shall be brought vnto thee .
With gladnesse and reioycing shall they be brought : they shall enter into the kings palace .
In stead of thy fathers shall bee thy children , whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth .
<NON-VERSE>
God is our refuge and strength : a very present helpe in trouble .
Therfore will not we feare , though the earth be remoued : and though the mountaines be caried into the midst of the sea .
Though the waters thereof roare , and be troubled , though the mountaines shake with the swelling thereof . Selah .
There is a riuer , the streames wherof shall make glad the citie of God : the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most High .
God is in the midst of her : she shal not be moued ; God shall helpe her , and that right early .
The heathen raged , the kingdomes were mooued : he vttered his voyce , the earth melted .
The Lord of hosts is with vs ; the God of Iacob is our refuge . Selah .
Come , behold the workes of the Lord , what desolations hee hath made in the earth .
He maketh warres to cease vnto the end of the earth : hee breaketh the bow , and cutteth the speare in sunder , he burneth the chariot in the fire .
Be stil , and know that I am God : I will bee exalted among the heathen , I will be exalted in the earth .
<NON-VERSE>
O Clap your hands ( all ye people : ) shoute vnto God with the voyce of triumph :
For the Lord most high is terrible ; he is a great King ouer all the earth .
Hee shall subdue the people vnder vs , and the nations vnder our feet .
He shall chuse our inheritance for vs , the excellencie of Iacob whom hee loued . Selah .
God is gone vp with a shout , the Lord with the sound of a trumpet .
Sing praises to God , sing praises : sing praises vnto our King , sing praises .
For God is the King of all the earth , sing ye praises with vnderstanding .
God reigneth ouer the heathen : God sitteth vpon the throne of his holinesse .
<NON-VERSE>
Great is the Lord , and greatly to bee praised in the citie of our God , in the mountaine of his holinesse .
Beautifull for situation , the ioy of the whole earth is mount Sion , on the sides of the North , the citie of the great King .
God is knowen in her palaces for a refuge .
For loe , the kings were assembled : they passed by together .
They sawe it , and so they marueiled , they were troubled and hasted away .
Feare tooke holde vpon them there , and paine , as of a woman in trauaile .
Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an East wind .
As we haue heard , so haue wee seene in the citie of the Lord of hosts , in the citie of our God , God will establish it for euer . Selah ,
Wee haue thought of thy louing kindnesse , O God , in the middest of thy Temple .
According to thy Name , O God , so is thy praise vnto the endes of the earth : thy right hand is full of righteousnesse .
Marke yee well her bulwarkes , consider her palaces ; that yee may tell it to the generation following .

Heare this , all yee people , giue eare all yee inhabitants of the world :
Both low , and high , rich and poore together .
My mouth shall speake of wisedome : and the meditation of my heart shalbe of vnderstanding .
I will incline mine eare to a parable ; I will open my darke saying vpon the harpe .
Wherefore should I feare in the daies of euill , when the iniquitie of my heeles shall compasse me about ?
They that trust in their wealth , and boast themselues in the multitude of their riches :
None of them can by any meanes redeeme his brother , nor giue to God a ransome for him :
( For the redemption of their soule is precious , and it ceaseth for euer . )
That he should still liue for euer , and not see corruption .
For he seeth that wise men die , likewise the foole , and the brutish person perish , and leaue their wealth to others .
Their inward thought is , that their houses shall continue for euer , and their dwelling places to all generations ; they call their lands after their owne names .
Like sheepe they are layd in the graue , death shall feede on them ; and the vpright shall haue dominion ouer them in the morning , and their beauty shall consume in the graue , from their dwelling .
But God will redeeme my soule from the power of the graue ; for he shall receiue me . Selah .
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased .
For when he dieth , he shall carry nothing away : his glory shall not descend after him .
Though whiles he liued , he blessed his soule : and men will praise thee , when thou doest well to thy selfe .
Hee shall goe to the generation of his fathers , they shall neuer see light .

The mightie God , euen the Lord hath spoken , and called the earth from the rising of the sunne , vnto the going downe thereof .
Out of Sion the perfection of beautie , God hath shined .
Our God shall come , and shall not keepe silence : a fire shall deuoure before him , and it shalbe very tempestuous round about him .
He shall call to the heauens from aboue , and to the earth , that hee may iudge his people .
Gather my Saints together vnto mee : those that haue made a couenant with me , by sacrifice .
And the heauens shall declare his righteousnes ; for God is iudge himselfe . Selah .
Heare , O my people , and I will speake , O Israel , and I will testifie against thee ; I am God , euen thy God .
I will not reproue thee for thy sacrifices , or thy burnt offerings , to haue bene continually before me .
I will take no bullocke out of thy house , nor hee goates out of thy folds .
For euery beast of the forrest is mine , and the cattell vpon a thousand hilles .
I know all the foules of the mountaines : and the wild beasts of the field are mine .
If I were hungry , I would not tell thee , for the world is mine , and the fulnesse thereof .
Will I eate the flesh of bulles , or drinke the blood of goats ?
Offer vnto God thankesgiuing , and pay thy vowes vnto the most high .
And call vpon mee in the day of trouble ; I will deliuer thee , and thou shalt glorifie me .
But vnto the wicked God saith , What hast thou to doe , to declare my Statutes , or that thou shouldest take my Couenant in thy mouth ?
Seeing thou hatest instruction , and castest my words behinde thee .
When thou sawest a thiefe , then thou consentedst with him , and hast bene partaker with adulterers .
Thou giuest thy mouth to euill , and thy tongue frameth deceit .
Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother ; thou slanderest thine owne mothers sonne .
These things hast thou done , and I kept silence : thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy selfe : but I will reproue thee , and set them in order before thine eyes .
Now consider this , ye that forget God , lest I teare you in pieces , and there be none to deliuer .
<NON-VERSE>
Haue mercie vpon mee , O God , according to thy louing kindnesse : according vnto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions . Wash mee throughly from mine iniquitie , and clense me from my sinne .
For I acknowledge my transgressions : and my sinne is euer before mee .
Against thee , thee onely haue I sinned , and done this euill in thy sight : that thou mightest bee iustified when thou speakest , and be cleare when thou iudgest .
Behold , I was shapen in iniquitie : and in sinne did my mother conceiue me .
Behold , thou desirest trueth in the inward parts : and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisedome .
Purge me with hyssope , and I shalbe cleane : wash me , and I shall be whiter then snow .
Make mee to heare ioy and gladnesse : that the bones which thou hast broken , may reioyce .
Hide thy face from my sinnes ; and blot out all mine iniquities .
Create in mee a cleane heart , O God ; and renew a right spirit within mee .
Cast mee not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy Spirit from me .
Restore vnto me the ioy of thy saluation : and vphold mee with thy free Spirit .
Then will I teach transgressours thy wayes , and sinners shalbe conuerted vnto thee .
Deliuer mee from blood - guiltinesse , O God , thou God of my saluation : and my tongue shall sing alowd of thy righteousnesse .
O Lord open thou my lips , and my mouth shall shew foorth thy praise . For thou desirest not sacrifice : else would I giue it : thou delightest not in burnt offering .
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , O God , thou wilt not despise .
Thou louest all deuouring words , O thou deceitfull tongue .
God shall likewise destroy thee for euer , hee shall take thee away and plucke thee out of thy dwelling place , and roote thee out of the land of the liuing . Selah .
The righteous also shall see , and feare , and shall laugh at him .
Loe , this is the man that made not God his strength : but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himselfe in his wickednesse .
<NON-VERSE>
The foole hath sayde in his heart , There is no god ; Corrupt are they , and haue done abhominable iniquitie ; there is none that doth good .
God looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men , to see if there were any that did vnderstand , that did seeke God .
Euery one of them is gone backe , they are altogether become filthy : there is none that doth good , no not one .
Haue the workers of iniquitie no knowledge ? who eate vp my people , as they eate bread ; they haue not called vpon God .
<NON-VERSE>
Saue me , O God , by thy name , and iudge me by thy strength .
Heare my prayer , O God ; giue eare to the words of my mouth .
For strangers are risen vp against me , and oppressors seeke after my soule ; they haue not set God before them . Selah .
Behold , God is mine helper : the Lord is with them that vphold my soule .
He shall reward euill vnto mine enemies : cut them off in thy trueth .
I will freely sacrifice vnto thee ; I will praise thy name ( O Lord : ) for it is good .
<NON-VERSE>
Giue eare to my prayer , O God : and hide not thy selfe from my supplication .
Attend vnto me , and heare me : I mourne in my complaint , and make a noise .
Because of the voyce of the enemie , because of the oppression of the wicked : for they cast iniquitie vpon me , and in wrath they hate me . My heart is sore pained within me : and the terrours of death are fallen vpon me .
Loe , then would I wander farre off , and remaine in the wildernesse . Selah .
I would hasten my escape from the windie storme , and tempest .
Destroy , O Lord , and diuide their tongues : for I haue seene violence and strife in the citie .
Day and night they goe about it vpon the walles thereof : mischiefe also and sorrow are in the midst of it .
Wickednesse is in the midst thereof : deceite and guile depart not from her streets .
For it was not an enemie that reproached me , then I could haue borne it , neither was it hee that hated me , that did magnifie himselfe against me , then I would haue hid my selfe from him .
But it was thou , a man , mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
Wee tooke sweet counsell together , and walked vnto the house of God in companie .
Let death seaze vpon them , and let them goe downe quicke into hell : for wickednes is in their dwellings , and among them .
As for me , I will call vpon God : and the Lord shall saue me .
Euening and morning , and at noone will I pray , and crie aloud : and he shall heare my voyce .
The words of his mouth were smoother then butter , but warre was in his heart : his words were softer then oyle , yet were they drawen swords .
Cast thy burden vpon the Lord , and he shall sustaine thee : hee shall neuer suffer the righteous to bee moued .
<NON-VERSE>
Be mercifull vnto mee , O God , for man would swallow me vp : he fighting daily , oppresseth me .
In God I will praise his worde , In God I haue put my trust , I will not feare what flesh can doe vnto me .
Euery day they wrest my words : all their thoughts are against mee for euill .
They gather themselues together ; they hide themselues , they marke my steps when they wait for my soule .
Shall they escape by iniquitie ? in thine anger cast downe the people , O God .
Thou tellest my wanderings , put thou my teares into thy bottle : are they not in thy booke ?
When I crie vnto thee , then shall mine enemies turne backe : this I know , for God is for me .
In God will I praise his word : in the Lord will I praise his word .
In God haue I put my trust : I will not bee afraid what man can doe vnto me .
Thy vowes are vpon me , O God : I will render praises vnto thee .

Hee shall send from heauen , and saue me from the reproch of him , that would swallow me vp ; Selah . God shall send forth his mercy and his trueth .
My soule is among lyons , and I lie euen among them that are set on fire : euen the sonnes of men , whose teeth are speares and arrowes , and their tongue a sharpe sword .
Be thou exalted , O God , aboue the heauens : let thy glory be aboue all the earth .
They haue prepared a net for my steppes , my soule is bowed downe : they haue digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselues . Selah .
My heart is fixed , O God , my heart is fixed : I will sing , and giue praise .
Awake vp my glory , awake psalterie and harpe ; I my selfe will awake early .
I will praise thee , O Lord , among the people ; I will sing vnto thee among the nations .
For thy mercy is great vnto the heauens , and thy trueth vnto the clouds .
Doe yee indeed speake righteousnesse , O congregation ? doe ye iudge vprightly , O ye sonnes of men ?
Yea , in heart you worke wickednesse ; you waigh the violence of your hands in the earth .
The wicked are estranged from the wombe , they goe astray as soone as they be borne , speaking lies .
Their poison is like the poyson of a serpent ; they are like the deafe adder that stoppeth her eare :
Let them melt away as waters , which runne continually : When he bendeth his bow to shoote his arrowes , let them be as cut in pieces .
As a snaile which melteth , let euery one of them passe away : like the vntimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sunne .
Before your pots can feele the thornes , he shall take them away as with a whirlewind , both liuing , and in his wrath .
The righteous shall reioyce when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feete in the blood of the wicked .

Deliuer me from mine enemies , O my God : defend mee from them that rise vp against me .
Thou therefore , O Lord God of hostes , the God of Israel , awake to visite all the heathen : be not mercifull to any wicked transgressours . Selah .
They returne at euening : they make a noise like a dogge , and go round about the citie .
Behold , they belch out with their mouth : swords are in their lippes ; for who , say they , doeth heare ?
The God of my mercy shall preuent me ; God shall let mee see my desire vpon mine enemies .
Slay them not , lest my people forget : scatter them by thy power ; and bring them downe , O Lord our shield .
For the sinne of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them euen be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speake .
Consume them in wrath , consume them , that they may not be : and let them know that God ruleth in Iacob , vnto the ends of the earth . Selah .
And at euening let them returne , and let them make a noise like a dogge , and goe round about the citie .
Let them wander vp and downe for meate , and grudge if they be not satisfied . But I will sing of thy power ; yea I will sing alowd of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast bene my defence and refuge , in the day of my trouble .

Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Iudah is my Lawgiuer .
Moab is my wash - pot , ouer Edom wil I cast out my shooe : Philistia , triumph thou because of me .
Who wil bring me into the strong citie ? who will lead me into Edom ?

Giue vs helpe from trouble : for vaine is the helpe of man .

I will abide in thy Tabernacle for euer : I will trust in the couert of thy wings . Selah .
For thou , O God , hast heard my vowes : thou hast giuen me the heritage of those that feare thy name .
Thou wilt prolong the kings life : and his yeeres as many generations .

Because thy louing kindnes is better then life : my lips shal praise thee .
Thus will I blesse thee , while I liue : I will lift vp my handes in thy Name .
My soule shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatnesse : and my mouth shall praise thee with ioyfull lips :
When I remember thee vpon my bed , and meditate on thee in the night watches .
Because thou hast bene my helpe ; therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I reioyce .
My soule followeth hard after thee : thy right hand vpholdeth me .
But those that seeke my soule to destroy it , shall goe into the lower parts of the earth .

Heare my voice , O God , in my praier ; preserue my life from feare of the enemie .
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked : from the insurrection of the workers of iniquitie :
Who whet their tongue like a sword , and bend their bowes to shoote their arrowes , euen bitter words : That they may shoote in secret at the perfect : suddenly doe they shoote at him , and feare not .
They incourage themselues in an euill matter : they commune of laying snares priuily ; they say , Who shall see them ?
They search out iniquities , they accomplish a diligent search : both the inward thought of euery one of them , and the heart , is deepe .
But God shall shoote at them : with an arrowe , sodenly shall they be wounded .
So they shall make their owne tongue to fall vpon themselues : all that see them , shall flee away .
And all men shall feare , and shall declare the worke of God ; for they shall wisely consider of his doing .
Praise waiteth for thee , O God , in Sion : and vnto thee shall the vowe be performed .
O thou that hearest prayer , vnto thee shall all flesh come .
Iniquities preuaile against me : as for our transgressions , thou shalt purge them away .

Which by his strength setteth fast the mountaines ; being girded with power .
Which stilleth the noise of the seas ; the noise of their waues , and the tumult of the people .
They also that dwell in the vttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning , and euening to reioyce .
Thou visitest the earth and waterest it : thou greatly inrichest it with the riuer of God which is full of water ; thou preparest them corne , when thou hast so prouided for it .
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrowes thereof : thou makest it soft with showres , thou blessest the springing thereof .
Thou crownest the yeere with thy goodnesse ; and thy paths drop fatnesse .
Make a ioyfull noise vnto God , all yee lands .
Sing forth the honour of his name : make his praise glorious .

They haue seene thy goings , O God , euen the goings of my God , my King , in the Sanctuarie .
The singers went before , the players on instruments followed after ; amongst them were the damosels playing with timbrels .
Blesse yee God , in the Congregations , euen the Lord , from the fountaine of Israel .
There is little Beniamin with their ruler , the princes of Iudah and their Councill , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali .
Thy God hath commanded thy strength : strengthen , O God , that which thou hast wrought for vs .
Because of thy Temple at Ierusalem , shall kings bring presents vnto thee .
Rebuke the company of spearemen , the multitude of the bulles , with the calues of the people , till euery one submit himselfe with pieces of siluer : scatter thou the people that delite in warre .
Princes shall come out of Egypt , Ethiopia shall soone stretch out her hands vnto God .
Sing vnto God , yee kingdomes of the earth : O sing praises vnto the Lord , Selah :
To him that rideth vpon the heauens of heauens , which were of olde : loe , hee doeth send out his voice , and that a mightie voice .
Ascribe yee strength vnto God : his excellencie is ouer Israel , and his strength is in the cloudes .
I sinke in deepe mire , where there is no standing : I am come into deepe waters , where the flouds ouerflow me .
I am weary of my crying , my throate is dried : mine eyes faile while I waite for my God .
They that hate mee without a cause , are moe then the haires of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mineenemies wrongfully , are mightie : then I restored that which I tooke not away .
O God , thou knowest my foolishnesse ; and my sinnes are not hidde from thee .
Let not them that waite on thee , O Lord God of hostes , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seeke thee , beconfounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
Because for thy sake I haue borne reproch : shame hath couered my face .
I am become a stranger vnto my brethren , and an aliant vnto my mothers children .
For the zeale of thine house hath eaten mee vp ; and the reproches of them that reproched thee , are fallen vpon me .
When I wept , and chastened my soule with fasting , that was to my reproch .
I made sackecloth also my garment : & I became a prouerbe to them .
They that sit in the gate , speake against mee ; and I was the song of the drunkards .
But as for mee , my prayer is vnto thee , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercie heareme , in the trueth of thy saluation .
Deliuer me out of the mire , and let me not sinke : let me bee deliuered from them that hate me , and out of thedeepe waters .
Let not the water flood ouerflow me , neither let the deepe swallow mee vp , and let not the pit shut her mouth vponme .
Heare me , O Lord , for thy louing kindnesse is good : turne vnto mee according to the multitude of thy tendermercies .
And hide not thy face from thy seruant , for I am in trouble : heare me speedily .
Draw nigh vnto my soule , and redeeme it : deliuer me because of mine enemies .
Thou hast knowen my reproch and my shame and my dishonor : mine aduersaries are all before thee .
Reproch hath broken my heart , and I am full of heauines : and I looked for some to take pitie , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
They gaue mee also gall for my meat , and in my thirst they gaue mee vineger to drinke .
Let their table become a snare before them : and that which should haue bene for their welfare , let it become atrap .
Let their eyes be darkened that they see not ; and make their loines continually to shake .
Powre out thine indignation vpon them , and let thy wrathfull anger take hold of them .
Let their habitation be desolate , and let none dwell in their tents .
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten , and they talke to the griefe of those whom thou hast wounded .
Adde iniquitie vnto their iniquitie : and let them not come into thy righteousnesse .
Let them bee blotted out of the booke of the liuing , and not be written with the righteous .
But I am poore , and sorowfull : let thy saluation ( O God ) set me vp on high .
I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnifie him with thankesgiuing .
This also shall please the Lord better then an oxe or bullocke that hath hornes and hoofes .
The humble shall see this , and be glad : and your heart shall liue that seeke good .
For the Lord heareth the poore , and despiseth not his prisoners .
Let the heauen and earth praise him , the seas , and euery thing that moueth therein .
For God will saue Sion , and will build the cities of Iudah , that they may dwell there , and haue it in possession .

Make haste , O God , to deliuer mee , make haste to helpe me , O Lord .
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seeke after my soule : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
Let them be turned backe for a reward of their shame , that say , Aha , aha .
Let all those that seeke thee , reioyce , and be glad in thee : and let such as loue thy saluation , say continually , Let God be magnified .

In thee , O Lord , doe I put my trust , let me neuer be put to confusion .
Deliuer mee in thy righteousnesse , and cause me to escape : incline thine eare vnto me , and saue me .

Deliuer me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the vnrighteous , and cruel man .
For thou art my hope , O Lord God : thou art my trust from my youth .
By thee haue I bene holden vp from the wombe : thou art hee that tooke mee out of my mothers vowels , my praise shalbe continually of thee .
I am as a wonder vnto many , but thou art my strong refuge .
Let my mouth bee filled with thy praise , and with thy honour all the day .
Cast me not off in the time of old age ; forsake me not when my strength faileth .
For mine enemies speake against mee : and they that lay waite for my soule , take counsell together ,
Saying , God hath forsaken him : persecute and take him , for there is none to deliuer him .
O God , be not farre from mee : O my God , make haste for my helpe .
Let them be confounded and consumed , that are aduersaries to my soule : let them bee couered with reproch and dishonour , that seeke my hurt .
But I wil hope continually , and will yet praise thee more and more .
My mouth shall shew foorth thy righteousnesse , and thy saluation all the day : for I know not the numbers thereof .
I will goe in the strength of the Lord God : I will make mention of thy righteousnesse , euen of thine onely .
O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto haue I declared thy wonderous workes .
Now also when I am old and gray headed , O God , forsake me not : vntill I haue shewed thy strength vnto this generation , and thy power to euery one that is to come .
Thy righteousnes also , O God , is very high , who hast done great things : O God , who is like vnto thee ?
Thou which hast shewed mee great , and sore troubles , shalt quicken mee againe , and shalt bring mee vp againe from the depthes of the earth .
Thou shalt increase my greatnesse , and comfort me on euery side .
I will also praise thee with the psalterie , euen thy trueth , O my God : vnto thee will I sing withthe harpe , O thou Holy one of Israel .
My lippes shall greatly reioyce when I sing vnto thee : and my soule , which thou hast redeemed .

Hee shall iudge the poore of the people , he shall saue the children of the needie , and shallbreake in pieces the oppressour .
They shall feare thee as long as the Sunne & Moone indure , throughout all generations .
Hee shall come downe like raine vpon the mowen grasse : as showres that water the earth .
In his dayes shall the righteous flourish : and abundance of peace so long as the Moone endureth .
He shall haue dominion also from sea to sea , and from the riuer , vnto the ends of the earth .
They that dwell in the wildernesse shall bowe before him : and his enemies shall licke the dust .
The kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring presents : the Kings of Sheba and Seba shalloffer gifts .
Yea , all Kings shall fall downe before him : all nations shall serue him .
For hee shall deliuer the needy when he crieth : the poore also , and him that hath no helper .
He shal spare the poore and needy , and shall saue the soules of the needy .
He shall redeeme their soule from deceit and violence : and precious shall their blood be in hissight .
And he shall liue , and to him shalbe giuen of the gold of Sheba ; prayer also shalbe made for himcontinually , and daily shall he be praised .
There shalbe an handfull of corne in the earth vpon the top of the mountaines ; the fruit thereofshall shake like Lebanon , and they of the citie shall flourish like grasse of the earth .
His name shall endure for euer : his name shalbe continued as long as the sunne : and men shalbeblessed in him ; all nations shall call him blessed .
Blessed be the Lord God , the God of Israel , who only doth wonderous things .
And blessed be his glorious name for euer , and let the whole earth be filled with his glory . Amen , and Amen .

Truely God is good to Israel , euen to such as are of a cleane heart .
But as for mee , my feete were almost gone : my steps had well - nigh slipt .
They are not in trouble as other men : neither are they plagued like other men .
Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chaine : violence couereth them as a garment .
Their eies stand out with fatnes : they haue more then heart could wish .
They are corrupt , and speake wickedly concerning oppression : they speake loftily .
They set their mouth against the heauens ; and their tongue walketh through the earth .
Therefore his people returne hither : and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them .
And they say , How doth God know ? and is there knowledge in the most High ?
Behold , these are the vngodly : who prosper in the world , they increase in riches .
Uerily I haue cleansed my heart in vaine , and washed my hands in innocencie .
For all the day long haue I bene plagued , and chastened euery morning .
Untill I went into the Sanctuarie of God ; then vnderstood I their end .
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places : thou castedst them downe into destruction .
How are they brought into desolation as in a moment ? they are vtterly consumed with terrours .
So foolish was I , and ignorant : I was as a beast before thee .
Neuerthelesse I am continually with thee : thou hast holden me by my right hand .
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsell ; and afterward receiue me to glory .
Whom haue I in heauen but thee ? and there is none vpon earth that I desire besides thee .
My flesh and my heart faileth : but God is the strength of my heart , and my portion for euer .
For loe , they that are farre from thee , shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that goe awhoring from thee .

O God , why hast thou cast vs off for euer ? why doeth thine anger smoke against the sheepe of thy pasture ?
Remember thy Congregation which thou hast purchased of olde : the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed , this mount Sion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
Lift vp thy feete vnto the perpetuall desolations : euen all that the enemie hath done wickedly in the Sanctuarie .
Thine enemies roare in the midst of thy congregations : they set vp their ensignes for signes . A man was famous according as he had lifted vp axes vpon the thicke trees .
But now they breake downe the carued worke thereof at once , with axes and hammers .
They haue cast fire into thy Sanctuary , they haue defiled by casting downe , the dwelling place of thy Nawe to the ground .
They said in their hearts , Let vs destroy them together : they haue burnt vp all the Synagogues of God in the land .
We see not our signes , there is no more any prophet , neither is there among vs any that knoweth howe long .
O God , how long shall the aduersarie reproach ? shall the enemie blaspheme thy Name for euer ?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand , euen thy right hand ? plucke it out of thy bosome .
For God is my King of old working saluation in the midst of the earth .
Thou didst diuide the sea by thy strength : thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters .
Thou brakest the heads of Leuiathan in pieces , and gauest him to bee meat to the people inhabiting the wildernesse .
Thou didst cleaue the fountaine and the flood : thou driedst vp mightie riuers .
The day is thine , the night also is thine : thou hast prepared the light and the sunne .
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth : Thou hast made Summer and Winter .
Remember this , that the enemie hath reproached , O Lord , and that the foolish people haue blasphemed thy Name .
O deliuer not the soule of thy turtle doue vnto the multitude of the wicked forget not the Congregation of thy poore for euer .
Haue respect vnto the couenant : for the darke places of the earth are full of the habitations of crueltie .
O let not the oppressed returne ashamed : let the poore and needie praise thy name .
Arise , O God , plead thine owne cause : remember how the foolish man reprocheth thee daily .

Unto thee , O God , doe we giue thankes , vnto thee doe we giue thanks : for that thy name is nere , thy wonderous works declare .
When I shall receiue the congregation , I will iudge vprightly .
Lift not vp your horne on high : speake not with a stiffe necke .
For promotion commeth neither from the East , nor from the West , nor from the South .
But God is the iudge : he putteth downe one , and setteth vp another .
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup , and the wine is red : it is full of mixture , and he powreth out of the same : but the dregges thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drinke them .
But I will declare for euer ; I will sing praises to the God of Iacob .

I cryed vnto God with my voice : euen vnto God with my voice , and he gaue eare vnto me .
In the day of my trouble , I sought the Lord ; my sore ranne in the night , and ceased not : my soule refused to be comforted .
I remembred God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit was ouerwhelmed . Selah .
Thou holdest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I cannot speake .
I haue considered the dayes of old , the yeeres of auncient times .
I call to remembrance my song in the night : I commune with mine owne heart , and my spirit made diligent search .
Will the Lord cast off for euer ? and will hee be fauourable no more ?
Is his mercy cleane gone for euer ? doth his promise faile for euermore ?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious ? hath he in anger shut vp his tender mercies ? Selah .
I will meditate also of all thy worke , and talke of thy doings .
Thy way , O God , is in the Sanctuarie : who is so great a God , as our God ?
Thou art the God that doest wonders ; thou hast declared thy strength among the people .
Thou hast with thine arme redeemed thy people , the sonnes of Iacob and Ioseph . Selah .
The waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee : they were afraid ; the depths also were troubled . The cloudes powred out water , the skies sent out a sound ; thine arrowes also went abroad .
The voice of thy thunder was in the heauen : the lightnings lightned the world , the earth trembled and shooke .
Giue eare , O my people , to my Lawe : incline your eares to the wordes of my mouth .
I will open my mouth in a parable : I wil vtter darke sayings of old :
Which we haue heard , & knowen : and our fathers haue told vs .
We will not hide them from their children , shewing to the generation to come , the praises of the Lord : and his strength , and his wonderful works that he hath done .
For he established a Testimony in Iacob , and appointed a Law in Israel , which he commaunded our fathers : that they should make them knowen to their children .
That the generation to come might know them , euen the children which should be borne : who should arise and declare them to their children :
That they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God : but keepe his Commandements ,
And might not bee as their fathers , a stubborne and rebellious generation , a generation that set not their heart aright : and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
The children of Ephraim being armed , and carying bowes , turned backe in the day of battell .
They kept not the couenant of God : and refused to walke in his Law :
And forgat his workes : and his wonders that he had shewed them .
Marueilous things did he in the sight of their fathers : in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
Hee diuided the Sea , and caused them to passe through : and he made the waters to stand as an heape .
In the day time also he led them with a cloud : and all the night with a light of fire . Hee claue the rockes in the wildernes : and gaue them drinke as out of the great depthes .
Hee brought streames also out of the rocke , and caused waters to runne downe like riuers .
And they sinned yet more against him : by prouoking the most High in the wildernes .
And they tempted God in their heart : by asking meat for their lust .
Yea , they spake against God : they said , Can God furnish a table in the wildernes ?
Behold , he smote the rocke , that the waters gushed out , & the streames ouerflowed ; can he giue bread also ? can he prouide flesh for his people ?
Therefore the Lord heard this , and was wroth , so a fire was kindled against Iacob : and anger also came vp against Israel .
Because they beleeued not in God : and trusted not in his saluation :
Though he had commanded the cloudes from aboue : and opened the doores of heauen :
And had rained downe Manna vpon them to eate , and had giuen them of the corne of heauen .
Man did eate Angels food : hee sent them meat to the full .
He caused an East wind to blow in the heauen : and by his power hee brought in the South wind .
He rained flesh also vpon them as dust : and feathered soules like as the sand of the sea .
And hee let it fall in the midst of their campe , round about their habitations .
So they did eate , & were well filled : for he gaue them their owne desire .
They were not estranged from their lust : but while their meate was yet in their mouthes ,
The wrath of God came vpon them , and slew the fattest of them : and smote downe the chosen men of Israel .
For all this they sinned still : and beleeued not for his wondrous works .
Therefore their dayes did he consume in vanitie , and their yeeres in trouble .
When hee slew them , then they sought him : and they returned , and inquired early after God .
And they remembred that God was their rocke : and the high God , their redeemer .
Neuerthelesse they did flatter him with their mouth : and they lyed vnto him with their tongues .
For their heart was not right with him : neither were they stedfast in his couenant .
But hee being full of compassion , forgaue their iniquity , and destroyed them not ; yea many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stirre vp all his wrath .
Yea they turned backe and tempted God : and limited the holy one of Israel .
They remembred not his hand : nor the day when hee deliuered them from the enemie :
How he had wrought his signes in Egypt : and his wonders in the field of Zoan :
And had turned their riuers into blood : and their flouds , that they could not drinke .
Hee sent diuers sorts of flies among them , which deuoured them : and frogges which destroyed them .
He gaue also their increase vnto the caterpiller : and their labour vnto the locust .
He destroyed their vines with haile : and their Sycomore trees with frost .
He gaue vp their cattel also to the haile : and their flockes to hot thunder - bolts .
He cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger , wrath and indignation , and trouble : by sending euill angels among them .
He made a way to his anger , hee spared not their soule from death : but gaue their life ouer to the pestilence .
And smote all the first borne in Egypt : the chiefe of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham :
But made his owne people to goe forth like sheepe : and guided them in the wildernesse like a flocke .
And he led them on safely , so that they feared not : but the sea ouerwhelmed their enemies .
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuarie : euen to this mountaine which his right hand had purchased .
He cast out the heathen also before them , and diuided them an inheritance by line : and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
Yet they tempted and prouoked the most high God : and kept not his testimonies :
But turned backe , and dealt vnfaithfully like their fathers : they were turned aside like a deceitfull bowe .
For they prouoked him to anger with their high places : and moued him to ielousie with their grauen images .
When God heard this , hee was wroth , and greatly abhorred Israel :
He gaue his people ouer also vnto the sword : and was wroth with his inheritance .
The fire consumed their young men : and their maidens were not giuen to mariage .
Their priests fell by the sword : and their widowes made no lamentation .
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleepe : and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine .
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts : he put them to a perpetuall reproch .
Moreouer he refused the tabernacle of Ioseph : and chose not the tribe of Ephraim .
But chose the tribe of Iudah : the mount Sion which he loued .
And he built his sanctuarie like high palaces : like the earth which he hath established for euer .
He chose Dauid also his seruant , and tooke him from the sheepe - folds :
From following the ewes great with young , hee brought him to feed Iacob his people , and Israel his inheritance .
<NON-VERSE>
O God , the heathen are come into thine , inheritance , thy holy temple haue they defiled : they haue layd Ierusalem on heapes .
The dead bodies of thy seruants haue they giuen to bee meate vnto the foules of the heauen : the flesh of thy Saints vnto the beasts of the earth .
Their blood haue they shed like water round about Ierusalem : and there was none to burie them .
We are become a reproach to our neighbours : a scorne and derision to them that are round about vs .
How long , Lord , wilt thou be angry , for euer ? shall thy ielousie burne like fire ?
Powre out thy wrath vpon the heathen that haue not knowen thee , and vpon the kingdomes that haue not called vpon thy name .
For they haue deuoured Iacob : and laid waste his dwelling place .
O remember not against vs former iniquities , let thy tender mercies speedily preuent vs : for we are brought very low .
Helpe vs , O God of our saluation , for the glory of thy Name : and deliuer vs , and purge away our sinnes for thy Names sake .
Wherfore should the heathen say , Where is their God ? let him be knowen among the heathen in our sight by the reuenging of the blood of thy seruants which is shed .
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee , according to the greatnesse of thy power : preserue thou those that are appointed to die .
And render vnto our neighbours seuen fold into their bosome , their reproach wherewith they haue reproched thee , O Lord .

Turne vs againe , O God : and cause thy face to shine , and we shall bee saued .

Thou makest vs a strife vnto our neighbours : and our enemies laugh among themselues .
Turne vs againe , O God of hosts , and cause thy face to shine , and we shall be saued .
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt : thou hast cast out the heathen , and planted it .
Thou preparedst roome before it : and didst cause it to take deepe root , and it filled the land .
The hilles were couered with the shadow of it , and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars .
She sent out her boughs vnto the Sea : and her branches vnto the riuer .
Returne , we beseech thee , O God of hosts : looke downe from heauen , and behold , and visit this vine :
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted : and the branch that thou madest strong for thy selfe .
It is burnt with fire , it is cut downe : they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance .
Let thy hand be vpon the man of thy right hand : vpon the sonne of man , whom thou madest strong for thy selfe .
So will not wee goe backe from thee : quicken vs , and we will call vpon thy Name .

O that my people had hearkned vnto me : and Israel had walked in my wayes !

They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people , and consulted against thy hidden ones .
They haue said , Come , and let vs cut them off from being a nation : that the name of Israel may bee no more in remembrance .
For they haue consulted together with one consent : they are confederate against thee .
The tabernacles of Edom , and the Ishmaelites : of Moab , and the Hagarens .
Gebal and Ammon , and Amalek : the Philistines , with the inhabitants of Tyre .
Assur also is ioyned with them : they haue holpen the children of Lot . Selah .

As the fire burneth a wood : and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire :
So persecute them with thy tempest : and make them afraid with thy storme .
Fill their faces with shame : that they may seeke thy name , O Lord .
Let them be confounded and troubled for euer : yea let them be put to shame , and perish :

All nations whom thou hast made , shall come and worship before thee , O Lord : and shall glorifie thy Name .
For thou art great , and doest wonderous things : thou art God alone .
Teach me thy way , O Lord , I will walke in thy trueth : vnite my heart to feare thy Name .
I will praise thee , O Lord my God , with all my heart : and I wil glorifie thy Name for euermore .
For great is thy mercy toward me : and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest hell .
O God , the proud are risen against mee , and the assemblies of violent men haue sought after my soule : and haue not set thee before them .
But thou , O Lord , art a God full of compassion , and gracious : long suffering , and plenteous in mercy and trueth .
O turne vnto me , and haue mercie vpon me , giue thy strength vnto thy seruant : and saue the sonne of thine handmaid .

The Lord loueth the gates of Zion : more then all the dwellings of Iacob .
Glorious things are spoken of thee , O Citie of God . Selah .
I will make mention of Rahab , and Babylon , to them that know mee ; behold Philistia , and Tyre , with Ethiopia : this man was borne there .
And of Zion it shalbe said , This and that man was borne in her : and the highest himselfe shall establish her .
The Lord shall count when he writeth vp the people : that this man was borne there . Selah .

O Lord God of my saluation , I haue cried day and night before thee .
Let my prayer come before thee : incline thine eare vnto my cry .
For my soule is full of troubles : and my life draweth nigh vnto the graue .
I am counted with them that go downe into the pit : I am as a man that hath no strength .
Free among the dead , like the slaine that lie in the graue , whom thou remembrest no more : and they are cut off from thy hand .
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit : in darkenesse , in the deepes .
Thy wrath lieth hard vpon me : and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waues . Selah .
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance farre from mee : thou hast made me an abomination vnto them : I am shut vp , and I cannot come forth .
Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction , Lord , I haue called daily vpon thee : I haue stretched out my hands vnto thee .
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead ? shal the dead arise and praise thee ? Selah .
Shall thy louing kindnesse be declared in the graue ? or thy faithfulnesse in destruction ?
Shall thy wonders be knowen in the darke ? and thy righteousnesse in the land of forgetfulnesse ?
But vnto thee haue I cried , O Lord , and in the morning shall my prayer preuent thee .
Thy fierce wrath goeth ouer me : thy terrours haue cut me off .
They came round about mee daily like water : they compassed mee about together .

Thy seed will I stablish for euer : and build vp thy throne to all generations . Selah .
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the Saints : and to bee had in reuerence of all them that are about him .
O Lord God of hosts , who is a strong Lord like vnto thee ? or to thy faithfulnesse round about thee ?
Thou rulest the raging of the sea : when the waues thereof arise ; thou stillest them .
Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces , as one that is slaine : thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arme .
The heauens are thine , the earth also is thine : as for the world and the fulnes thereof , thou hast founded them .
The North and the South , thou hast created them : Tabor and Hermon shall reioyce in thy Name .
Thou hast a mighty arme : strong is thy hand , and high is thy right hand .
Iustice and iudgement are the habitation of thy throne : mercie and trueth shall goe before thy face .
Blessed is the people that knowe the ioyfull sound : they shall walke O Lord in the light of thy countenance .
In thy name shall they reioyce all the day : and in thy righteousnes shall they be exalted .
For thou art the glory of their strength : and in thy fauour our horne shall be exalted .
For the Lord is our defence : and the holy One of Israel is our king .
Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , I haue laid helpe vpon one that is mightie : I haue exalted one chosen out of the people .
I haue found Dauid my seruant : with my holy oile haue I anointed him .
With whome my hand shall bee established : mine arme also shall strengthen him .
The enemie shall not exact vpon him : nor the sonne of wickednesse afflict him .
And I will beate downe his foes before his face : and plague them that hate him .
But my faithfulnesse and my mercy shalbe with him : and in my name shall his horne be exalted .
I will set his hand also in the sea : and his right hand in the riuers .
He shall crie vnto mee , Thou art my father : my God , and the rocke of my saluation .
Also I will make him my first borne : higher then the kings of the earth . My mercy will I keepe for him for euermore : and my couenant shall stand fast with him .
His seed also will I make to indure for euer : and his throne as the dayes of heauen . If his children forsake my lawe , and walke not in my iudgements ;
If they breake my statutes , and keepe not my commandements :
Then will I visite their transgression with the rod , and their iniquitie with stripes .
Once haue I sworne by my holinesse ; that I will not lye vnto Dauid .
His seede shall endure for euer ; and his throne as the sunne before me .
Thou hast set vp the right hand of his aduersaries : thou hast made all his enemies to reioyce .
Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword : and hast not made him to stand in the battaile . Thou hast made his glory to cease : and cast his throne downe to the ground .
The dayes of his youth hast thou shortned : thou hast couered him with shame . Selah .
How long , Lord , wilt thou hide thy selfe , for euer ? shall thy wrath burne like fire ?
Remember how short my time is : wherefore hast thou made all men in vaine ?
What man is he that liueth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliuer his soule from the hand of the graue ? Selah .
Wherewith thine enemies haue reproached , O Lord : wherewith they haue reproached the foote - steppes of thine Annointed .

Lord , thou hast bene our dwelling place in all generations .
Before the mountaines were broughtforth , or euer thou hadst formed the earth and the world : euen from euerlasting to euerlasting thou art God .
Thou turnest man to destruction : and sayest , Returne yee children of men .
For a thousand yeeres in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past : and as a watch in the night .
Thou carriest them away as with a flood , they are as a sleepe : in the morning they are like grasse which groweth vp .
In the morning it flourisheth , and groweth vp : in the euening it is cut downe , and withereth .
For we are consumed by thine anger : and by thy wrath are we troubled .
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee : our secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance .
For all our dayes are passed away in thy wrath : we spend our yeeres as a tale that is told .
The dayes of our yeres are threescore yeeres and ten , and if by reason of strength they be fourescore yeeres , yet is their strength labour and sorrow : for it is soone cut off , and we flie away .
Who knoweth the power of thine anger ? euen according to thy feare , so is thy wrath .
So teach vs to number our daies : that wee may apply our hearts vnto wisedome .
Returne ( O Lord ) how long ? and let it repent thee concerning thy seruants .
O satisfie vs early with thy mercie : that we may reioyce , and be glad all our dayes .
Make vs glad according to the dayes wherein thou hast afflicted vs : and the yeeres wherein we haue seene euil .
Let thy worke appeare vnto thy seruants : and thy glory vnto their children .

Surely he shall deliuer thee from the snare of the fouler : and from the noisome pestilence .
Hee shall couer thee with his feathers , and vnder his wings shalt thou trust : his trueth shall bee thy shield and buckler .
Thou shalt not bee afraid for the terrour by night : nor for the arrow that flieth by day :
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darknes : nor for the destruction , that wasteth at noone - day .
A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand : but it shall not come nigh thee .
Onely with thine eyes shalt thou behold : & see the reward of the wicked .
Because thou hast made the Lord , which is my refuge , euen the most High , thy habitation :
There shall no euill befall thee : neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling .
For hee shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee : to keepe thee in all thy wayes .
They shall beare thee vp in their hands : lest thou dash thy foot against a stone .
Thou shalt tread vpon the Lion , and adder : the yong Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample vnder feete .
Because he hath set his loue vpon me , therefore will I deliuer him : I wil set him on high , because hee hath knowen my Name .
He shall call vpon me , and I will answere him : I will bee with him in trouble , I will deliuer him , and honour him .

It is a good thing to giue thanks vnto the Lord , and to sing praises vnto thy Name , O most High :
To shew foorth thy louing kindnesse in the morning : and thy faithfulnesse euery night :
Upon an instrument of tenne strings , and vpon the psalterie : vpon the harpe with a solemne sound .
For thou , Lord , hast made me glad through thy worke : I will triumph in the workes of thy hands .
O Lord , how great are thy workes ! and thy thoughts are very deepe .
A brutish man knoweth not : neither doeth a foole vnderstand this .
When the wicked spring as the grasse , and when all the workers of iniquitie doe flourish : it is that they shall be destroyed for euer .
¶ But thou , Lord , art most high for euermore .
For loe , thine enemies , O Lord , for loe , thine enemies shall perish : all the workers of iniquity shalbe scattred .
But my horne shalt thou exalt like the horne of an vnicorne : I shalbe anointed with fresh oyle .
Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies : and mine eares shall heare my desire of the wicked that rise vp against me .
The righteous shal flourish like the palme tree : hee shall growe like a cedar in Lebanon .
Those that be planted in the house of the Lord , shall flourish in the courts of our God .
They shal still bring forth fruit in old age : they shalbe fat , & flourishing :

Lift vp thy selfe , thou iudge of the earth : render a reward to the proud . Lord , how long shall the wicked ? how long shall the wicked triumph ?
How long shal they vtter , and speake hard things ? and all the workers of iniquitie boast themselues ?
They breake in pieces thy people , O Lord : and afflict thine heritage .
They slay the widowe and the stranger : and murder the fatherlesse .
Yet they say , The Lord shall not see : neither shall the God of Iacob regard it .
Understand , yee brutish among the people : and ye fooles , when will ye be wise ?
He that planted the eare , shall he not heare ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
He that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? hee that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man : that they are vanitie .
Blessed is the man whome thou chastenest , O Lord : and teachest him out of thy Law :
That thou mayest giue him rest from the dayes of aduersitie : vntill the pit be digged for the wicked .
For the Lord will not cast off his people : neither will he forsake his inheritance .
But iudgement shall returne vnto righteousnesse : and all the vpright in heart shall follow it .
Who will rise vp for mee against the euill doers ? or who will stand vp for me against the workers of iniquitie ?
Unlesse the Lord had bene my helpe : my soule had almost dwelt in silence .
When I said , My foote slippeth : thy mercie , O Lord , held me vp .
In the multitude of my thoughts within me , thy comforts delight my soule .
Shal the throne of iniquitie haue fellowship with thee : which frameth mischiefe by a lawe ?
They gather themselues together against the soule of the righteous : and condemne the innocent blood .
But the Lord is my defence : and my God is the rocke of my refuge .

For he is our God , and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheepe of his hand : to day if yee will heare his voyce ,

Fortie yeeres long was I grieued with this generation : and sayd , It is a people that doe erre in their heart : and they haue not knowen my wayes .

The heauens declare his righteousnesse : and all the people see his glory .
Confounded be all they that serue grauen images , that boast themselues of idoles : worship him all yee gods .

Heare my prayer , O Lord : and let my crie come vnto thee .
Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble , incline thine eare vnto me : in the day when I call , answere mee speedily .
For my dayes are consumed like smoke : and my bones are burnt as an hearth .
My heart is smitten , and withered like grasse : so that I forget to eate my bread .
By reason of the voice of my groning , my bones cleaue to my skinne .
I am like a Pelican of the wildernes : I am like an owle of the desert .
I watch , and am as a sparowe alone vpon the house top .
Mine enemies reproch me all the day : and they that are mad against me , are sworne against me .
For I haue eaten ashes like bread : and mingled my drinke with weeping .
Because of thine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me vp , and cast me downe .
My dayes are like a shadow , that declineth : & I am withered like grasse .
But thou , O Lord , shalt endure for euer : and thy remembrance vnto all generations .
Thou shalt arise , and haue mercie vpon Zion : for the time to fauour her , yea the set time is come .
For thy seruants take pleasure in her stones : and fauour the dust therof .
So the heathen shall feare the Name of the Lord : and all the kings of the earth thy glory .
When the Lord shall build vp Zion : he shall appeare in his glory .
He will regard the prayer of the destitute , and not despise their prayer .
This shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created , shall praise the Lord .
For hee hath looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie : from heauen did the Lord beholde the earth :
To heare the groning of the prisoner : to loose those that are appointed to death :
To declare the Name of the Lord in Zion : and his praise in Ierusalem :
When the people are gathered together : and the kingdomes to serue the Lord .
He weakened my strength in the way : he shortened my dayes .
I said , O my God , take me not away in the midst of my dayes : thy yeres are throughout all generations .
Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth : and the heauens are the worke of thy hands .
They shall perish , but thou shalt indure , yea all of them shall waxe old like a garment : as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shalbe changed .
Blesse the Lord , O my soule : and all that is within me , blesse his holy Name .
Blesse the Lord , O my soule : & forget not all his benefits .
Who forgiueth all thine iniquities : who healeth all thy diseases .
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction : who crowneth thee with louing kindnesse and tender mercies .
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things : so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles .
The Lord executeth righteousnesse : and iudgement for all that are oppressed .
He made knowen his wayes vnto Moses : his actes vnto the children of Israel .
The Lord is mercifull and gracious : slow to anger , and plenteous in mercy .
Hee will not alwayes chide : neither will he keepe his anger for euer .
Hee hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes : nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities .
For as the heauen is high aboue the earth : so great is his mercy toward them that feare him .
As farre as the East is from the West : so farre hath hee remooued our transgressions from vs .
Like as a father pitieth his children : so the Lord pitieth them that feare him .
For he knoweth our frame : hee remembreth that we are dust .
As for man , his dayes are as grasse : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .
For the winde passeth ouer it , and it is gone ; and the place thereof shall know it no more .
But the mercy of the Lord is from euerlasting to euerlasting vpon them that feare him : and his righteousnesse vnto childrens children :
To such as keepe his couenant : and to those that remember his commandements to doe them .
The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heauens : and his kingdome ruleth ouer all .
Blesse the Lord yee his Angels , that excell in strength , that do his commandements : hearkening vnto the voice of his word .
Blesse ye the Lord all yee his hostes : ye ministers of his that doe his pleasure .

Blesse the Lord , O my soule , O Lord my God , thou art very great : thou art clothed with honour and maiestie .
Who couerest thy selfe with light , as with a garment : who stretchest out the heauens like a curtaine .
Who layeth the beames of his chambers in the waters , who maketh the cloudes his charet : who walketh vpon the wings of the wind .
Who maketh his Angels spirits : his ministers a flaming fire .
Who laid the foundations of the earth : that it should not be remoued for euer .
Thou coueredst it with the deepe as with a garment : the waters stood aboue the mountaines .
At thy rebuke they fled : at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away .
They go vp by the mountaines : they goe downe by the valleys vnto the place which thou hast founded for them .
Thou hast set a bound that they may not passe ouer : that they turne not againe to couer the earth .
He sendeth the springs into the valleys : which runne among the hilles .
They giue drinke to euery beast of the field : the wild asses quench their thirst .
By them shall the foules of the heauen haue their habitation : which sing among the branches .
He watereth the hilles from his chambers : the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy workes .
He causeth the grasse to grow for the cattell , and herbe for the seruice of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth :
Where the birds make their nests : as for the Storke , the firre trees are her house .
The hie hilles are a refuge for the wilde goates : and the rockes for the conies .
He appointed the moone for seasons ; the sunne knoweth his going downe .
Thou makest darknesse , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forrest doe creepe forth .
The young lyons roare after their pray : and seeke their meate from God .
The sunne ariseth , they gather themselues together : and lay them downe in their dennes .
Man goeth forth vnto his worke : and to his labour , vntill the euening .
O Lord , how manifold are thy workes ! in wisedome hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches .
So is this great and wide Sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable : both small and great beasts .
There goe the shippes ; there is that Leuiathan , whom thou hast made to play therein .
These waite all vpon thee : that thou mayest giue them their meate in due season .
Thou sendest forth thy spirit , they are created : and thou renewest the face of the earth .
The glory of the Lord shall endure for euer : the Lord shall reioyce in his workes .
Hee looketh on the earth , and it trembleth ; he toucheth the hilles , and they smoke .
I will sing vnto the Lord as long as I liue : I will sing praise to my God , while I haue my being .
My meditation of him shalbe sweete : I will be glad in the Lord .

Seeke the Lord , and his strength : seeke his face euermore .

O yee seede of Abraham his seruant : yee children of Iacob his chosen .
And confirmed the same vnto Iacob for a law : and to Israel for an euerlasting couenant :
Saying , Unto thee will I giue the land of Canaan : the lot of your inheritance .
When they were but a few men in number : yea very few , & strangers in it .
When they went from one nation to another : from one kingdome to another people .
He suffred no man to doe them wrong : yea he reproued kings for their sakes :
Saying , Touch not mine anointed ; and doe my Prophets no harme .
Moreouer hee called for a famine vpon the land : he brake the whole staffe of bread .
Hee sent a man before them : euen Ioseph , who was sold for a seruant .
Whose feete they hurt with fetters : he was layd in iron .
Untill the time that his word came : the word of the Lord tried him .
The king sent and loosed him : euen the ruler of the people , and let him goe free .
Hee made him lord of his house : and ruler of all his substance :
To binde his princes at his pleasure : and teach his Senatours wisedome .
Israel also came into Egypt : and Iacob soiourned in the land of Ham .
And hee increased his people greatly : and made them stronger then their enemies .
He turned their heart to hate his people : to deale subtilly with his seruants .
Hee sent Moses his seruant : and Aaron whom he had chosen .
They shewed his signes among them : and wonders in the land of Ham .
Hee sent darknesse , and made it darke : and they rebelled not against his word .
Hee turned their waters into blood : and slew their fish .
The land brought foorth frogs in abundance : in the chambers of their kings .
He spake , and there came diuers sorts of flies : and lice in all their coasts .
Hee gaue them haile for raine : and flaming fire in their laud .
Hee smote their Uines also , and their figge trees : and brake the trees of their coastes .
He spake , and the locusts came : and catterpillers , and that without number ,
And did eate vp all the herbes in their land : and deuoured the fruite of their ground .
Hee smote also all the first borne in their land : the chiefe of all their strength .
Hee brought them foorth also with siluer and gold : and there was not one feeble person among their tribes .
Egypt was glad when they departed : for the feare of them fell vpon them .
He spread a cloud for a couering : and fire to giue light in the night .
The people asked , and he brought quailes : and satisfied them with the bread of heauen .
He opened the rocke , and the waters gushed out : they ranne in the dry places like a riuer .
For he remembred his holy promise : and Abraham his seruant .
And he brought forth his people with ioy : and his chosen with gladnesse :
And gaue them the lands of the heathen : and they inherited the labour of the people :

Praise ye the Lord . O giue thankes vnto the Lord , for he is good : for his mercie endureth for euer .
Who can vtter the mighty acts of the Lord ? who can shew foorth all his praise ?

Remember me , O Lord , with the fauour that thou bearest vnto thy people : O visite me with thy saluation :
That I may see the good of thy chosen , that I may reioyce in the gladnesse of thy nation : that I may glory with thine inheritance .
Wee haue sinned with our fathers : we haue committed iniquitie , we haue done wickedly .
Our fathers vnderstood not thy wonders in Egypt , they remembred not the multitude of thy mercies : but prouoked him at the sea , euen at the Red - sea .
Neuerthelesse hee saued them for his Names sake : that hee might make his mighty power to be knowen .
He rebuked the Red sea also , and it was dried vp : so hee led them through the depthes , as through the wildernes .
And he saued them from the hand of him that hated them : and redeemed them from the hand of the enemie .
And the waters couered their enemies : there was not one of them left .
Then beleeued they his words : they sang his praise .
They soone forgate his works : they waited not for his counsell :
But lusted exceedingly in the wildernes : & tempted God in the desert .
And he gaue them their request : but sent leannesse into their soule .
They enuied Moses also in the campe : and Aaron the Saint of the Lord .
The earth opened and swallowed vp Dathan : and couered the company of Abiram .
And a fire was kindled in their company : the flame burnt vp the wicked . They made a calfe in Horeb : and worshipped the molten image .
Thus they changed their glory , into the similitude of an oxe that eateth grasse .
They forgate God their Sauiour : which had done great things in Egypt :
Wonderous workes in the lande of Ham : and terrible things by the red Sea .
Therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach : to turne away his wrath , lest hee should destroy them .
Yea , they despised the pleasant land : they beleeued not his word :
But murmured in their tents : and hearkened not vnto the voyce of the Lord .
Therefore he lifted vp his hande against them : to ouerthrow them in the wildernesse :
To ouerthrow their seed also among the nations , and to scatter them in the lands .
They ioyned themselues also vnto Baal - Peor : and ate the sacrifices of the dead .
Thus they prouoked him to anger with their inuentions : and the plague brake in vpon them . Then stood vp Phinehas , and executed iudgement : and so the plague was stayed .
And that was counted vnto him for righteousnesse : vnto all generations for euermore .
They angred him also at the waters of strife : so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes :
Because they prouoked his spirit : so that hee spake vnaduisedly with his lippes .
They did not destroy the nations , concerning whom the Lord commanded them :
But were mingled among the heathen , and learned their workes .
And they serued their idoles : which were a snare vnto them .
Yea they sacrificed their sonnes , and their daughters vnto deuils ,
And shed innocent blood , euen the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whome they sacrificed vnto the idoles of Canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
Thus were they defiled with their owne works : and went a whoring with their owne inuentions .
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people : insomuch that he abhorred his owne inheritance .
And he gaue them into the hand of the heathen : and they that hated them , ruled ouer them .
Their enemies also oppressed them : and they were brought into subiection vnder their hand .
Many times did he deliuer them : but they prouoked him with their counsell , and were brought low for their iniquitie .
Neuertheles he regarded their affliction : when he heard their crie .
And hee remembred for them his couenant : and repented according to the multitude of his mercies .
He made them also to be pitied , of all those that caried them captiues .
Saue vs , O Lord our God , and gather vs from among the heathen to giue thankes vnto thy holy Name : and to triumph in thy praise .
<NON-VERSE>
O giue thankes vnto the Lord , for hee is good : for his mercie endureth for euer .
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so : whome he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemie :
And gathered them out of the lands , from the East and from the West : from the North and from the South .
They wandred in the wildernes , in a solitary way : they found no citie to dwell in .
Hungry and thirstie : their soule fainted in them .
Then they cryed vnto the Lord in their trouble : and he deliuered them out of their distresses .
And hee led them forth by the right way : that they might goe to a citie of habitation .
Oh that men would praise the Lord , for his goodnesse : and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men .
For he satisfieth the longing soule : and filleth the hungry soule with goodnesse .
Such as sit in darknesse and in the shadowe of death : being bound in affliction and yron :
Because they rebelled against the words of God : and contemned the counsell of the most high :
Therefore hee brought downe their heart with labour : they fel downe , and there was none to helpe .
Then they cryed vnto the Lord in their trouble : and he saued them out of their distresses .
Hee brought them out of darkenesse , and the shadowe of death : and brake their bands insunder .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse : and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men .
For he hath broken the gates of brasse : and cut the barres of yron in sunder .
Fooles , because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
Their soule abhorreth all manner of meate : and they drawe neere vnto the gates of death .
Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble : he saueth them out of their distresses .
Hee sent his word , and healed them : and deliuered them from their destructions .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse : and for his wonderfull workes , to the children of men .
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thankesgiuing : and declare his workes with reioycing .
They that goe downe to the sea in shippes : that doe businesse in great waters :
These see the workes of the Lord : and his wonders in the deepe .
For he commandeth , and raiseth the stormy winde : which lifteth vp the waues thereof .
They mount vp to the heauen : they goe downe againe to the depthes : their soule is melted because of trouble .
They reele to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man ; and are at their wits end .
Then they cry vnto the Lord in their trouble : and hee bringeth them out of their distresses .
He maketh the storme a calme : so that the waues thereof are still .
Then are they glad , because they be quiet : so he bringeth them vnto their desired hauen .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse ; and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men :
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the Elders .
Hee turneth riuers into a wildernesse : and the water springs into dry ground :
A fruitfull land into barrennesse ; for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein .
He turneth the wildernesse into a standing water : and dry ground into water - springs .
And there he maketh the hungry to dwell ; that they may prepare a citie for habitation ,
And sowe the fields , and plant vineyards ; which may yeeld fruits of increase .
He blesseth them also , so that they are multiplied greatly : and suffreth not their cattell to decrease .
Againe , they are minished and brought lowe through oppression , affliction and sorrow .
Hee powreth contempt vpon princes : and causeth them to wander in the wildernesse , where there is no way .
Yet setteth he the poore on high from affliction : and maketh him families like a flocke .
The righteous shall see it , and reioyce ; and all iniquitie shall stop her mouth .
<NON-VERSE>
O God , my heart is fixed : I will sing & giue praise , euen with my glory .

For thy mercy is great aboue the heauens : and thy trueth reacheth vnto the clouds .
Be thou exalted , O God , aboue the heauens : and thy glory aboue all the earth :
That thy beloued may bee deliuered : saue with thy right hand , and answere me .
God hath spoken in his holinesse , I wil reioyce , I will diuide Shechem : and mete out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine , Manasseh is mine , Ephraim also is the strength of mine head : Iudah is my Lawgiuer .
Moab is my wash pot , ouer Edom wil I cast out my shooe : ouer Philistia will I triumph .
Who wil bring me into the strong citie ? who will leade me into Edom ?
Wilt not thou , O God , who hast cast vs off ? and wilt not thou , O God , goe foorth with our hostes ?
Giue vs helpe from trouble : for vaine is the helpe of man .
<NON-VERSE>
Hold not thy peace , O God of my praise .
For the mouth of the wicked , and the mouth of the deceitfull are opened against mee : they haue spoken against me with a lying tongue .
They compassed mee about also with wordes of hatred : and fought against me without a cause .
For my loue , they are my aduersaries : but I giue my selfe vnto prayer .
And they haue rewarded me euill for good : and hatred for my loue .
Set thou a wicked man ouer him : and let Satan stand at his right hand .
When he shall be iudged , let him be condemned : and let his prayer become sinne .
Let his dayes be few : and let another take his office .
Let his children bee fatherlesse : and his wife a widow .
Let his children bee continually vagabonds , & begge : let them seeke their bread also out of their desolate places .
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath : and let the strangers spoile his labour .
Let there be none to extend mercy vnto him : neither let there be any to fauour his fatherlesse children .
Let his posteritie be cut off : and in the generation folowing let their name be blotted out .
Let the iniquitie of his fathers be remembred with the Lord : and let not the sinne of his mother be blotted out .
Let them be before the Lord continually : that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth .
Because that he remembred not to shew mercy , but persecuted the poore and needy man : that he might euen slay the broken in heart .
As he loued cursing , so let it come vnto him : as hee delighted not in blessing , so let it be farre from him .
As he clothed himselfe with cursing like as with his garment : so let it come into his bowels like water , and like oyle into his bones .
Let it be vnto him as the garment which couereth him : and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually .
Let this be the reward of mine aduersaries from the Lord : and of them that speake euill against my soule .
But do thou for me , O God the Lord , for thy Names sake : because thy mercie is good : deliuer thou me .
For I am poore and needie : and my heart is wounded within me .
I am gone like the shadow , when it declineth : I am tossed vp and downe as the locust .
My knees are weake through fasting : and my flesh faileth of fatnesse .
I became also a reproch vnto them : when they looked vpon me , they shaked their heads .
Helpe me , O Lord my God : O saue me according to thy mercie .
That they may know , that this is thy hand : that thou , Lord , hast done it .
Let them curse , but blesse thou : when they arise , let them be ashamed , but let thy seruant reioyce .
Let mine aduersaries be clothed with shame : and let them couer them selues with their owne confusion , as with a mantle .
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth : yea I will praise him among the multitude .

That he may set him with princes : euen with the princes of his people .

Beholde , as the eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their Masters , and as the eyes of a maiden , vnto the hand of her mistresse : so our eyes waite vpon the Lord our God , vntill that he haue mercy vpon vs . Haue mercy vpon vs , O Lord , haue mercy vpon vs : for we are exceedingly filled with contempt .

If it had not bene the Lord who was on our side : nowe may Israel say :
If it had not bene the Lord , who was on our side , when men rose vp against vs :
Then they had swallowed vs vp quicke : when their wrath was kindled against vs . Then the waters had ouerwhelmed vs ; the streame had gone ouer our soule .
Then the proud waters had gone ouer our soule .
Blessed be the Lord : who hath not giuen vs as a pray to their teeth .
Our soule is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the foulers ; the snare is broken , and we are escaped .

Then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing , then said they among the heathen : The Lord hath done great things for them .
The Lord hath done great things for vs : whereof we are glad .
Turne againe our captiuitie , O Lord : as the streames in the South .
Except the Lord build the house , they labour in vaine that build it : except the Lord keepe the citie , the watchman waketh but in vaine .
It is vaine for you to rise vp early , to sit vp late , to eate the bread of sorrowes : for so hee giueth his beloued sleepe .
Loe , children are an heritage of the Lord : and the fruit of the wombe is his reward .
As arrowes are in the hand of a mightie man : so are children of the youth .

Let them all be confounded and turned backe , that hate Zion .

Untill I finde out a place for the Lord : an habitation for the mightie God of Iacob .
Loe , wee heard of it at Ephrata : we found it in the fields of the wood .
We will goe into his tabernacles : we will worship at his footstoole .
Arise , O Lord , into thy rest : thou , and the Arke of thy strength .
Let thy Priestes be clothed with righteousnesse : and let thy saints shout for ioy .
For thy seruant Dauids sake : turne not away the face of thine Anointed .
The Lord hath sworne in trueth vnto Dauid , hee will not turne from it ; of the fruit of thy body will I set vpon thy throne .
If thy children will keepe my couenant and my testimonie , that I shall teach them ; their children also shall sit vpon thy throne for euermore .
For the Lord hath chosen Zion : he hath desired it for his habitation .
This is my rest for euer : here will I dwell , for I haue desired it .
I will abundantly blesse her prouision : I will satisfie her poore with bread .

There will I make the horne of Dauid to budde : I haue ordained a lampe for mine Anointed .

And from Iesus Christ , who is the faithful witnesse , and the first begotten of the dead , and the Prince of the kings of the earth : vnto him that loued vs , and washed vs from our sinnes in his owne blood ,
And hath made vs Kings and Priests vnto God and his Father : to him be glory and dominion for euer and euer , Amen .
Behold he commeth with clouds , and euery eye shal see him , and they also which pearced him : and all kinreds of the earth shall waile because of him : euen so . Amen .

I Iohn , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdome and patience of Iesus Christ , was in the Isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimonie of Iesus Christ .
I was in the spirit on the Lords day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
Saying , I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last : and what thou seest , write in a booke , and send it vnto the seuen Churches which are in Asia , vnto Ephesus , and vnto Smyrna , and vnto Pergamos , and vnto Thyatira , and vnto Sardis , and Philadelphia , and vnto Laodicea .
And I turned to see the voice that spake with mee . And being turned , I saw seuen golden Candlesticks ,
And in the midst of the seuen candlestickes , one like vnto the Sonne of man , clothed with a garment downe to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
His head , and his haires were white like wooll as white as snow , and his eyes were as a flame of fire ,
And his feet like vnto fine brasse , as if they burned in a furnace : and his voice as the sound of many waters .
And hee had in his right hand seuen starres : and out of his mouth went a sharpe two edged sword : and his countenance was as the Sunne shineth in his strength .
And when I sawe him , I fell at his feete as dead : and hee laid his right hand vpon me , saying vnto mee , Feare not , I am the first , and the last .
I am hee that liueth , and was dead : and behold , I am aliue for euermore , Amen , and haue the keyes of hell and of death .

And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my Names sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
Neuerthelesse , I haue somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first loue .
Remember therfore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and doe the first workes , or else I will come vnto thee quickly , and will remoue thy Candlesticke out of his place , except thou repent .
But this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
Hee that hath an eare , let him heare what the Spirit saith vnto the Churches : To him that ouercommeth will I giue to eate of the tree of life , which is in the middest of the Paradise of God .
And vnto the Angel of the Church in Smyrna , write , These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is aliue ,
I know thy works , and tribulation , and pouertie , but thou art rich , and I know the blasphemie of them which say they are Iewes and are not , but are the Synagogue of Satan .
Feare none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the deuill shal cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried , and yee shall haue tribulation tenne dayes : bee thou faithfull vnto death , and I will giue thee a crowne of life .
He that hath an eare , let him heare what the spirit saith vnto the churches . He that ouercommeth , shall not be hurt of the second death .
And to the Angel of the Church in Pergamos , write , These things saith hee , which hath the sharpe sword with two edges :
I know thy workes , and where thou dwellest , euen where Satans seat is , and thou holdest fast my Name , and hast not denied my faith , euen in those daies , wherein Antipas was my faithful Martyr , who was slaine among you , where Satan dwelleth .
But I haue a fewe things against thee , because thou hast there them that holde the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumbling blocke before the children of Israel , to eate things sacrificed vnto idoles , and to commit fornication .
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans , which thing I hate .
Repent , or else I will come vnto thee quickly , and wil fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
Hee that hath an eare , let him heare what the Spirit saith vnto the Churches . To him that ouercommeth will I giue to eate of the hidden Manna , and will giue him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth , sauing hee that receiueth it .
And vnto the Angel of the church in Thyatira , write , These things saith the Sonne of God , who hath his eyes like vnto a flame of fire , and his feete are like fine brasse :
I know thy works , and charitie , and seruice , and faith , and thy patience , and thy workes , and the last to bee more then the first .
Notwithstanding , I haue a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Iezebel , which calleth herselfe a Prophetesse , to teach and to seduce my seruants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed vnto idoles .
And I gaue her space to repent of her fornication , and she repented not .
Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her , into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
And I will kill her children with death , and all the Churches shall know that I am hee which searcheth the reines and hearts : and I will giue vnto euery one of you according to your workes .
But vnto you I say , and vnto the rest in Thyatira , as many as haue not this doctrine , and which haue not knowen the depthes of Satan , as they speake , I will put vpon you none other burden :
But that which ye haue already , hold fast till I come .
And hee that ouercommeth , and keepeth my workes vnto the ende , to him will I giue power ouer the nations : ( And he shall rule them with a rod of yron : as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shiuers : ) euen as I receiued of my Father .
And I will giue him the morning starre .

And vnto the Angel of the Church in Sardis write , These things saith he that hath the seuen Spirits of God , & the seuen starres ; I know thy workes , that thou hast a name that thou liuest , and art dead .
Be watchfull , and strengthen the things which remaine , that are ready to die : for I haue not found thy works perfect before God .
Remember therefore , how thou hast receiued and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thiefe , and thou shalt not know what houre I will come vpon thee .
Thou hast a few names euen in Sardis , which haue not defiled their garments , and they shall walke with me in white : for they are worthy .
Hee that ouercommeth , the same shalbe clothed in white raiment , and I will not blot out his name out of the booke of life , but I will confesse his name before my Father , and before his Angels .
Hee that hath an eare , let him heare what the Spirit saith vnto the Churches .
And to the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia write , These things saith he that is Holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of Dauid , he that openeth , and no man shutteth , and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
I know thy workes : behold , I haue set before thee an open doore , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my Name .
Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Iewes , and are not , but doe lie : behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feete , and to know that I haue loued thee .
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keepe thee from the houre of temptation , which shall come vpon all the world , to try them that dwell vpon the earth .
Beholde , I come quickly , hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crowne .
Him that ouercommeth , will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God , and he shall goe no more out : and I wil write vpon him the Name of my God , and the name of the Citie of my God , which is new Hierusalem , which commeth downe out of heauen from my God : And I will write vpon him my New name .
Hee that hath an eare , let him heare what the Spirit saith vnto the Churches .
So then because thou art lukewarme , and neither cold nor hot , I wil spew thee out of my mouth :
Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and haue need of nothing : and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poore , and blinde , and naked .
I counsell thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest bee rich , and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakednesse doe not appeare , and anoint thine eyes with eye salue , that thou mayest see .
As many as I loue , I rebuke and chasten , be zealous therefore , and repent .
Behold , I stand at the doore , and knocke : if any man heare my voyce , and open the doore , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
To him that ouercommeth , will I graunt to sit with mee in my throne , euen as I also ouercame , and am set downe with my Father in his throne .
<NON-VERSE>
After this I looked , and beholde , a doore was opened in heauen : and the first voice which I heard , was as it were of a trumpet , talking with me , which said , Come vp hither , and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter .
And immediatly I was in the spirit : and beholde , a Throne was set in heauen , and one sate on the Throne .
And he that sate was to looke vpon like a Iasper , and a Sardine stone : and there was a rainebow round about the Throne , in sight like vnto an Emeralde .
And round about the Throne were foure and twentie seates , and vpon the seates I saw foure and twentie Elders sitting , clothed in white rayment , and they had on their heades crownes of golde .
And out of the Throne proceeded lightnings , and thundrings , and voyces : and there were seuen lampes of fire burning before the Throne , which are the seuen Spirits of God .
And before the Throne there was a sea of glasse like vnto Chrystall : and in the middest of the throne , and round about the Throne , were foure beastes full of eyes before and behinde .
And the first beast was like a Lion , and the second beast like a Calfe , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying Egle .
And the foure beasts had each of them sixe wings about him , and they were full of eyes within , and they rest not day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , which was , and is , and is to come .
And when those beasts giue glory , and honour , and thankes to him that sate on the Throne , who liueth for euer and euer ,
The foure and twentie Elders fall downe before him that sate on the Throne , and worship him that liueth for euer and euer , and cast their crownes before the Throne , saying ,
<NON-VERSE>
And I saw in the right hand of him that sate on the Throne , a booke written within , & on the backeside , sealed with seuen seales .
And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loude voice ; Who is worthy to open the booke , and to loose the seales thereof ?
And no man in heauen , nor in earth , neither vnder the earth , was able to open the booke , neither to looke thereon .
And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open , and to reade the booke , neither to looke thereon .
And one of the Elders saith vnto me , Weepe not : beholde , the Lion of the tribe of Iuda , the roote of Dauid , hath preuailed to open the booke , and to loose the seuen seales thereof .
And I beheld , and loe , in the middest of the Throne , and of the foure beastes , and in the midst of the Elders stood a Lambe as it had beene slaine , hauing seuen hornes and seuen eyes , which are the seuen Spirits of God , sent foorth into all the earth .
And he came , and tooke the booke out of the right hand of him that sate vpon the Throne .
And when he had taken the booke , the foure Beasts , and foure and twenty Elders fel down before the Lambe , hauing euery one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of Saints .
And they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the Booke , and to open the seales thereof : for thou wast slaine , and hast redeemed vs to God by thy blood , out of euery kinred , and tongue , and people , and nation :
And hast made vs vnto our God Kings and Priests , and we shall reigne on the earth .
And I beheld , and I heard the voyce of many Angels , round about the Throne , and the beasts and the Elders , and the number of them was ten thousand times tenne thousand , and thousands of thousands ,
Saying with a lowd voice , Worthy is the Lambe that was slaine , to receiue power , and riches , and wisedome , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
And euery creature which is in heauen , and on the earth , and vnder the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I , saying , Blessing , honour , glory , and power bee vnto him that sitteth vpon the Throne , and vnto the Lambe for euer and euer .
<NON-VERSE>
And I sawe when the Lambe opened one of the seales , and I heard as it were the noise of thunder , one of the foure beastes , saying , Come and see .
And I saw , and behold , a white horse , and hee that sate on him had a bowe , and a crowne was giuen vnto him , and hee went foorth conquering , and to conquere .
And when hee had opened the second seale , I heard the second beast say , Come and see .
And there went out another horse that was red : and power was giuen to him that sate thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was giuen vnto him a great sword .
And when hee had opened the third seale , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . And I beheld , and loe , a blacke horse : and hee that sate on him had a paire of balances in his hand .
And I heard a voice in the midst of the foure beastes say , A measure of wheate for a penie , and three measures of barley for a penie , and see thou hurt not the oyle and the wine .
And when hee had opened the fourth seale , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
And I looked , and behold , a pale horse , & his name that sate on him was Death , and hell followed with him : and power was giuen vnto them , ouer the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword , & with hunger , and with death , and with the beastes of the earth .
And when hee had opened the fift seale , I saw vnder the altar , the soules of them that were slaine for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held .
And they cried with a lowd voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , doest thou not iudge and auenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
And white robes were giuen vnto euery one of them , and it was sayd vnto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , vntill their fellow seruants also , and their brethren that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
And I beheld when he had opened the sixt seale , and loe , there was a great earthquake , and the Sunne became blacke as sackecloth of haire , and the Moone became as blood .
And the starres of heauen fell vnto the earth , euen as a figge tree casteth her vntimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty winde .
And the heauen departed as a scrowle when it is rolled together , and euery mountaine and Island were moued out of their places .
And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chiefe captaines , and the mighty men , and euery bondman , and euery free man , hid themselues in the dennes , and in the rockes of the mountaines ,
And said to the mountaines and rockes , Fall on vs , and hide vs from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lambe :
<NON-VERSE>
And after these things , I saw foure Angels standing on the foure corners of the Earth , holding the foure windes of the earth , that the winde should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
And I saw another Angel ascending from the East , hauing the seale of the liuing God : and he cried with a loud voice to the foure Angels to whom it was giuen to hurt the earth and the Sea ,
Saying , Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till wee haue sealed the seruants of our God in their foreheads .
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelue thousand . Of the tribe of Ioseph were sealed twelue thousand . Of the tribe of Beniamin were sealed twelue thousand .
After this I beheld , and lo , a great multitude , which no man could number of all nations , and kindreds , and people , & tongues , stood before the throne , & before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palmes in their hands :
And cryed with a loude voice , saying , Saluation to our God , which sitteth vpon the Throne , and vnto the Lambe .
And all the Angels stood round about the Throne , and about the Elders , and the foure beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
Saying , Amen : Blessing , and glorie , and wisedome , and thankesgiuing , and honour , & power , and might be vnto our God for euer & euer , Amen .
And one of the Elders answered , saying vnto mee , What are these which are arayed in white robes ? and whence came they ?
And I said vnto him , Sir , thou knowest . And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and haue washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lambe .
Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serue him day and night in his Temple : and hee that sitteth on the Throne shal dwell among them .
They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more , neither shall the Sunne light on them , nor any heate .
<NON-VERSE>
And when hee had opened the seuenth seale , there was silence in heauen about the space of halfe an houre .
And I sawe the seuen Angels which stood before God , and to them were giuen seuen trumpets .
And another Angel came & stood at the altar , hauing a golden censer , and there was giuen vnto him much incense , that hee should offer it with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden altar which was before the throne .
And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints , ascended vp before God , out of the Angels hand .
And the Angel tooke the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voyces , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake :
And the seuen Angels which had the seuen trumpets , prepared themselues to sound .
The first Angel sounded , and there followed haile , and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast vpon the earth , and the third part of trees was burnt vp , and all greene grasse was burnt vp .
And the second Angel sounded , and as it were a great mountaine burning with fire was cast into the sea , and the third part of the sea became blood .
And the thirde part of the creatures which were in the Sea , and had life , died , and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
And the third Angel sounded , and there fell a great starre from heauen , burning as it were a lampe , and it fell vpon the third part of the riuers , and vpon the fountaines of waters :
And the name of the starre is called Wormewood , and the third part of the waters became wormewood , and many men dyed of the waters , because they were made bitter .
And the fourth Angel sounded , and the thirde part of the Sunne was smitten , & the third part of the Moone , and the third part of the starres , so as the third part of them was darkened : and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
<NON-VERSE>
And the fift Angel sounded , and I saw a starre fall from heauen vnto the earth : and to him was giuen the key of the bottomlesse pitte .
And hee opened the bottomelesse pit , and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great fornace , and the sunne and the ayre were darkened , by reason of the smoke of the pit .
And there came out of the smoke locusts vpon the earth , and vnto them was giuen power , as the Scorpions of the earth haue power .
And it was commaunded them that they should not hurt the grasse of the earth , neither any greene thing , neither any tree : but only those men which haue not the seale of God in their foreheads .
And to them it was giuen that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented fiue moneths , and their torment was as the torment of a Scorpion , when he striketh a man .
And in those daies shal men seeke death , and shall not finde it , and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
And the shapes of the Locusts were like vnto horses prepared vnto battell , and on their heades were as it were crownes like golde , and their faces were as the faces of men .
And they had haire as the haire of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of Lions .
And they had brestplates , as it were brestplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was as the sound of charets of many horses running to battell .
And they had tayles like vnto Scorpions , and there were stings in their tayles : and their power was to hurt men fiue moneths .
And they had a king ouer them , which is the Angel of the bottomlesse pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greeke tongue hath his name Apollyon .
One woe is past , and behold there come two woes more hereafter .
And the sixt Angel sounded , and I heard a voyce from the foure hornes of the golden altar , which is before God ,
Saying to the sixt Angel which had the trumpet , Loose the foure Angels which are bound in the great riuer Euphrates .
And the foure Angels were loosed , which were prepared for an houre , and a day , and a moneth , and a yeere , for to slay the third part of men .
And the number of the armie of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
And thus I sawe the horses in the vision , and them that sate on them , hauing brest - plates of fire and of Iacinct , and brimstone , & the heades of the horses were as the heads of Lions , and out of their mouthes issued fire , and smoke , and brimstone .
By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouthes .
For their power is in their mouth , and in their tailes : for their tailes were like vnto serpents , and had heads , and with them they doe hurt .
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues , yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship deuils , and idoles of golde , and siluer , and brasse , and stone , and of wood , which neither can see , nor heare , nor walke :
<NON-VERSE>
And I saw another mighty Angel come down from heauen , clothed with a cloud , and a rainebow was vpon his head , and his face was as it were the Sunne , and his feet as pillars of fire .
And hee had in his hand a little booke open : and hee set his right foote vpon the sea , and his left foote on the earth ,
And cryed with a loude voice , as when a Lion roareth : and when hee had cried , seuen thunders vttered their voices .
And when the seuen thunders had vttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heauen , saying vnto mee , Seale vp those things which the seuen thunders vttered , and write them not .
And the Angel which I saw stand vpon the sea , and vpon the earth , lifted vp his hand to heauen ,
And sware by him that liueth for euer and euer , who created heauen , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should bee time no longer .
But in the dayes of the voice of the seuenth Angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mysterie of God should be finished , as hee hath declared to his seruants the Prophets .
And the voice which I heard from heauen spake vnto me againe , and said , Go , and take the litle booke which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth vpon the sea , and vpon the earth .
And I went vnto the Angel , and said vnto him , Giue me the little booke . And he sayd vnto me , Take it , and eat it vp , and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall bee in thy mouth sweete as hony .
And I tooke the little booke out of the Angels hand , and ate it vp , and it was in my mouth sweet as honie : and as soone as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
<NON-VERSE>
And there was giuen me a reede like vnto a rod , and the Angel stood , saying , Rise , and measure the Temple of God , and the Altar , and them that worship therein .
But the Court which is without the Temple leaue out , and measure it not : for it is giuen vnto the Gentiles , and the holy citie shall they tread vnder foote fourty and two moneths .
And I will giue power vnto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesie a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes clothed in sackcloth .
These are the two oliue trees , and the two candlestickes , standing before the God of the earth .
And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and deuoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , hee must in this maner be killed .
These haue power to shut heauen , that it raine not in the dayes of their prophesie : and haue power ouer waters to turne them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
And when they shall haue finished their testimonie , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomlesse pit , shall make warre against them , and shall ouercome them , and kill them .
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great citie , which spiritually is called Sodome and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
And they of the people , and kinreds , and tongues , and nations , shal see their dead bodies three dayes and an halfe , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graues .
And they that dwell vpon the earth shall reioyce ouer them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another , because these two Prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
And after three dayes and an halfe the Spirit of life from God , entred into them : and they stood vpon their feete , and great feare fell vpon them which saw them .
And they heard a great voyce from heauen , saying vnto them , Come vp hither . And they ascended vp to heauen in a cloud , and their enemies beheld them .
And the same houre was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slaine of men seuen thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gaue glory to the God of heauen .
The second woe is past , and behold , the third woe commeth quickly .
And the seuenth Angel sounded , and there were great voyces in heauen , saying , The kingdomes of this world are become the kingdomes of our Lord , and of his Christ , and he shall reigne for euer and euer .
And the foure and twentie Elders which sate before God on their seates , fell vpon their faces , and worshipped God ,
Saying , Wee giue thee thankes , O Lord God Almightie , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
And the nations were angry , and thy wrath is come , and the time of the dead that they should bee iudged , and that thou shouldest giue reward vnto thy seruants the Prophets , and to the Saints , & them that feare thy Name , small and great , and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth .

And there appeared a great wonder in heauen , a woman clothed with the Sunne , & the Moone vnder her feete , and vpon her head a Crowne of twelue starres :
And shee being with childe , cried , trauailing in birth , and pained to be deliuered .
And there appeared another wonder in heauen , and behold a great red dragon , hauing seuen heads , and ten hornes , and seuen crownes vpon his heads .
And his taile drew the third part of the starres of heauen , and did cast them to the earth : And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be deliuered , for to deuoure her childe as soone as it was borne .
And shee brought foorth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of yron : and her child was caught vp vnto God , and to his Throne .
And the woman fled into the wildernesse , where shee hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand , two hundred , and threescore dayes .
And there was warre in heauen , Michael and his Angels fought against the dragon , & the dragon fought and his angels ,
And preuailed not , neither was their place found any more in heauen .
And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the deuill and Satan , which deceiueth the whole world : hee was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
And I heard a lowd voyce saying in heauen , Now is come saluation , and strength , and the kingdome of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
And they ouercame him by the blood of the Lambe , and by the word of their Testimony , and they loued not their liues vnto the death .
Therefore reioyce , yee heauens , and yee that dwell in them ; Woe to the inhabiters of the earth , and of the sea : for the deuill is come downe vnto you , hauing great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
And when the dragon saw that he was cast vnto the earth , hee persecuted the woman which brought foorth the man childe .
And to the woman were giuen two wings of a great Eagle , that shee might flee into the wildernesse into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and halfe a time , from the face of the serpent .
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood , after the woman : that he might cause her to bee caried away of the flood .
And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed vp the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .

And I stoode vpon the sand of the sea : and saw a beast rise vp out of the sea , hauing seuen heads , and tenne hornes , and vpon his hornes tenne crownes , and vpon his heads , the name of blasphemie .
And the beast which I saw , was like vnto a Leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a Beare , and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion : and the dragon gaue him his power , and his seat , and great authoritie .
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death , and his deadly wound was healed : and al the world wondered after the beast .
And they worshipped the dragon which gaue power vnto the beast , and they worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like vnto the beast ? Who is able to make warre with him ?
And there was giuen vnto him a mouth , speaking great things , and blasphemies , and power was giuen vnto him to continue fortie and two moneths .
And he opened his mouth in blasphemie against God , to blaspheme his Name , and his Tabernacle , and them that dwelt in heauen .
And it was giuen vnto him to make warre with the Saints , and to ouercome them : And power was giuen him ouer all kinreds , and tongues , and nations .
And all that dwel vpon the earth , shall worship him , whose names are not written in the booke of life of the Lambe , slaine from the foundation of the world .
If any man haue an eare , let him heare :
Hee that leadeth into captiuitie , shall goe into captiuitie : Hee that killeth with the sword , must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints .
And I beheld another beast comming vp out of the earth , and hee had two hornes like a lambe , and hee spake as a dragon .
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein , to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
And hee doeth great wonders , so that hee maketh fire come downe from heauen on the earth in the sight of men ,
And deceiueth them that dwel on the earth , by the meanes of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast , saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an Image to the beast which had the wound by a sword , and did liue .
And he had power to giue life vnto the Image of the beast , that the Image of the beast should both speake , and cause that as many as would not worship the Image of the beast , should be killed .
And he causeth all , both smal and great rich and poore , free and bond , to receiue a marke in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
And that no man might buy or sell , saue he that had the marke , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .

And I looked , and loe , a Lambe stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundreth fourty and foure thousand , hauing his Fathers Name written in their foreheads .
And I heard a voice from heauen , as the voice of many waters , and as the voyce of a great thunder : and I heard the voyce of harpers , harping with their harpes .
And they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the foure beasts , and the Elders , and no man could learne that song , but the hundreth and fourtie and foure thousand , which were redeemed from the earth .
These are they which were not defiled with women : for they are virgines : These are they which follow the Lambe whithersoeuer hee goeth : These were redeemed from among men , being the first fruits vnto God , and to the Lambe .
And in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
And I saw another Angel flie in the midst of heauen , hauing the euerlasting Gospel , to preach vnto them that dwel on the earth , and to euery nation , and kinred , and tongue , and people ,
Saying with a loud voice , Feare God , and giue glory to him , for the houre of his iudgement is come : and worshippe him that made heauen and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
And there followed another Angel , saying , Babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great citie , because she made all nations drinke of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
And the third Angel followed them , saying with a lowd voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receiue his marke in his forehead , or in his hand ,
The same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God , which is powred out without mixture into the cup of his indignation , and hee shall be tormented with fire and brimstone , in the presence of the holy Angels , and in the presence of the Lambe :
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth vp for euer and euer . And they haue no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoeuer receyueth the marke of his name .
Here is the patience of the Saints : Here are they that keepe the Commandements of God , and the faith of Iesus .
And I heard a voyce from heauen , saying vnto me , Write , Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord , from hencefoorth , yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours , and their workes doe follow them .
And I looked , and beholde , a white cloud , and vpon the cloude one sate like vnto the sonne of man , hauing on his head a golden crowne , and in his hand a sharpe sickle .
And another Angel came out of the Temple crying with a loude voice to him that sate on the cloud : Thrust in thy sickle and reape , for the time is come for thee to reape , for the haruest of the earth is ripe .
And hee that sate on the cloude thrust in his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
And another Angel came out of the Temple which is in heauen , he also hauing a sharpe sickle .
And another Angel came out from the Altar , which had power ouer fire , and cryed with a loud cry to him , that had the sharpe sickle , saying , Thrust in thy sharpe sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , for her grapes are fully ripe .
And the Angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , & cast it into the great winepresse of the wrath of God .

And I saw another signe in heauen great and marueilous , seuen Angels hauing the seuen last plagues , for in them is filled vp the wrath of God .
And I saw as it were a Sea of glasse , mingled with fire , and them that had gotten the victorie ouer the beast , and ouer his image , and ouer his marke , and ouer the number of his name , stand on the sea of glasse , hauing the harpes of God .
And they sing the song of Moses the seruant of God , and the song of the Lambe , saying , Great and marueilous are thy workes , Lord God Almightie , iust and true are thy wayes , thou king of saints .
Who shall not feare thee , O Lord , and glorifie thy Name ? for thou onely art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee , for thy iudgements are made manifest .
And after that I looked , and behold , the Temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heauen was opened :
And the seuen Angels came out of the Temple , hauing the seuen plagues , clothed in pure and white linnen , and hauing their breasts girded with golden girdles .
And one of the foure beasts gaue vnto the seuen Angels , seuen golden vials , full of the wrath of God , who liueth for euer and euer .
<NON-VERSE>
And I heard a great voyce out of the Temple , saying to the seuen Angels , Goe your wayes , and powre out the vials of the wrath of God vpon the earth .
And the first went , and powred out his viall vpon the earth , and there fell a noysome and grieuous sore vpon the men which had the marke of the beast , and vpon them which worshipped his image .
And the second Angel powred out his viall vpon the sea , and it became as the blood of a dead man : and euery liuing soule died in the sea .
And the third Angel powred out his viall vpon the riuers and fountaines of waters , & they became blood .
And I heard the Angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast iudged thus :
For they haue shedde the blood of Saints and Prophets , and thou hast giuen them blood to drinke : for they are worthy .
And I heard another out of the altar say , Euen so , Lord God Almightie , true and righteous are thy iudgements .
And the fourth Angel powred out his viall vpon the Sunne , and power was giuen vnto him to scorch men with fire .
And men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the Name of God , which hath power ouer these plagues : and they repented not , to giue him glory .
And the fift Angel powred out his viall vpon the seat of the beast , and his kingdome was full of darkenesse , and they gnawed their tongues for paine ,
And blasphemed the God of heauen , because of their paines , and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
And the sixt Angel powred out his viall vpon the great riuer Euphrates , and the water thereof was dried vp , that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared .
And I saw three vncleane spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , & out of the mouth of the beast , & out of the mouth of the false prophet .
For they are the spirits of deuils working miracles , which goe forth vnto the Kings of the earth , and of the whole world , to gather them to the battell of that great day of God Almighty .
Behold , I come as a thiefe . Blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , least hee walke naked , and they see his shame .
And hee gathered them together into a place , called in the Hebrewe tongue , Armageddon .
And the seuenth Angel powred out his viall into the ayre , and there came a great voyce out of the Temple of heauen , from the throne , saying , It is done .
And there were voices and thunders , and lightnings : and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were vpon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
And the great Citie was diuided into three parts , and the Cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to giue vnto her the cup of the wine of the fiercenesse of his wrath .
And euery yland fled away , and the mountaines were not found .
<NON-VERSE>
And there came one of the seuen Angels , which had the seuen vials , and talked with me , saying vnto mee , Come hither , I will shew vnto thee the iudgement of the great Whore , that sitteth vpon many waters :
With whom the kings of the earth haue committed fornication , and the inhabiters of the earth haue beene made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
So he caried me away in the Spirit into the wildernesse : and I saw a woman sit vpon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , hauing seuen heads , and ten hornes .
And the woman was arayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold , and precious stone & pearles , hauing a golden cup in her hand , full of abominations and filthinesse of her fornication .
And vpon her forehead was a name written , Mystery , Babylon The Great , The Mother Of Harlots , And Abominations Of The Earth .
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints , and with the blood of the Martyrs of Iesus : and when I saw her , I wondred with great admiration .
And the Angel saide vnto mee , Wherefore didst thou marueile ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carieth her , which hath the seuen heads , and ten hornes .
The beast that thou sawest , was , and is not , and shall ascend out of the bottomlesse pit , and goe into perdition , and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder , ( whose names were not written in the booke of life from the foundation of the world ) when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
And here is the mind which hath wisedome . The seuen heads are seuen mountaines , on which the woman sitteth .
And there are seuen Kings , fiue are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come : and when he commeth , he must continue a short space .
And the beast that was , and is not , euen he is the eighth , & is of the seuen , and goeth into perdition .
And the tenne hornes which thou sawest , are ten kings , which haue receiued no kingdom as yet : but receiue power as kings one houre with the beast .
These haue one minde , and shall giue their power and strength vnto the beast .
These shal make warre with the Lambe , and the Lambe shal ouercome them : For he is Lord of Lords , and King of kings , and they that are with him , are called , & chosen , and faithfull .
And he saith vnto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
And the ten hornes which thou sawest vpon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate , and naked , and shall eate her flesh , and burne her with fire .
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will , and to agree , and giue their kingdome vnto the beast , vntil the words of God shall be fulfilled .

And after these things , I saw another Angel come downe from heauen , hauing great power , and the earth was lightened with his glory .
And he cryed mightily with a strong voyce , saying , Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of deuils , and the hold of euery foule spirit , and a cage of euery vncleane and hatefull bird :
For all nations haue drunke of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the Kings of the earth haue committed fornication with her , & the Merchants of the earth are waxed rich thorow the abundance of her delicacies .
And I heard another voice from heauen , saying , Come out of her , my people , that yee be not partakers of her sinnes , and that yee receiue not of her plagues :
For her sinnes haue reached vnto heauen , and God hath remembred her iniquities .
Reward her euen as she rewarded you , and double vnto her double according to her works : in the cup which she hath filled , fill to her double .
How much she hath glorified her selfe , and liued deliciously , so much torment and sorrow giue her : for she saith in her heart , I sit a Queene , and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow .
Therefore shall her plagues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine , and she shall bee vtterly burnt with fire , for strong is the Lord God , who iudgeth her .
And the Kings of the earth , who haue committed fornication , and liued deliciously with her , shall bewaile her and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning :
Standing afarre off for the feare of her torment , saying , Alas , alas , that great citie Babylon , that mighty citie : for in one houre is thy iudgement come .
And the Merchants of the earth shall weepe and mourne ouer her , for no man buyeth their merchandise any more .
The merchandise of gold , and siluer , and pretious stones , and of pearles , and fine linnen , and purple , and silke , and scarlet , and all Thine wood , and all maner vessels of Yuorie , and all maner vessels of most precious wood , and of brasse , and iron , and marble ,
The Merchants of these things which were made riche by her , shall stand afarre off for the feare of her torment , weeping and wailing .
And saying , Alas , alas , that great city , that was clothed in fine linnen , and purple and scarlet , and decked with gold , and pretious stones , and pearles :
For in one houre so great riches is come to nought . And euery shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailers , and as many as trade by sea , stood a farre off ,
And cryed when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , What city is like vnto this great citie ?
And they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping , and wailing , saying , Alas , alas , that great citie , wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea , by reason of her costlinesse , for in one houre is she made desolate .
Reioyce ouer her thou heauen , and ye holy Apostles and Prophets , for God hath auenged you on her .
And a mightie Angel tooke vp a stone like a great milstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great citie Babylon bee throwen downe , and shall bee found no more at all .
And the voyce of harpers and musitions , and of pipers , and trumpetters , shall bee heard no more at all in thee : and no craftsman , of whatsoeuer craft hee be , shall be found any more in thee : and the sound of a milstone shalbe heard no more at all in thee :
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee : and the voice of the bridegrome and of the bride shalbe heard no more at all in thee : for thy Merchants were the great men of the earth : for by thy sorceries were all nations deceiued .
<NON-VERSE>
And after these things I heard a great voyce of much people in heauen , saying , Alleluia : saluation , and glorie , and honour , and power vnto the Lord our God :
For true and righteous are his iudgements , for hee hath iudged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath auenged the blood of his seruants at her hand .
And againe they sayd , Alleluia : and her smoke rose vp for euer & euer .
And the foure and twentie Elders , and the foure beasts fell downe , and worshipped God that sate on the throne , saying , Amen , Alleluia .
And a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God all yee his seruants , and ye that feare him , both small and great .
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mightie thundrings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
Let vs bee glad and reioyce , and giue honour to him : for the mariage of the Lambe is come , and his wife hath made herselfe readie .
And to her was granted , that she should bee arayed in fine linnen , cleane and white : for the fine linnen is the righteousnesse of Saints .
And hee saith vnto mee , Write , Blessed are they which are called vnto the marriage supper of the Lambe . And he saith vnto mee , These are the true sayings of God .
And I fell at his feete to worship him : And he said vnto me , See thou doe it not : I am thy fellow seruant , and of thy brethren , that haue the testimonie of Iesus , Worship God : for the testimony of Iesus , is the spirit of prophecie .
And I sawe heauen opened , and behold a white horse , and hee that sate vpon him was called faithful and true , and in righteousnes hee doth iudge and make warre .
His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crownes , and hee had a name written , that no man knew but he himselfe .
And hee was clothed with a vesture dipt in blood , and his name is called , The word of God .
And the armies which were in heauen followed him vpon white horses , clothed in fine linnen , white and cleane .
And out of his mouth goeth a sharpe sword , that with it hee should smite the nations : and he shal rule them with a rod of yron : and he treadeth the winepresse of the fiercenesse and wrath of Almighty God .
And he hath on his vesture , and on his thigh a name written , King Of Kings , And Lord Of Lords .
And I saw an Angel standing in the Sunne , and hee cried with a lowd voyce , saying to all the foules that flie in the midst of heauen , Come and gather your selues together vnto the supper of the great God :
That yee may eate the flesh of Kings , and the flesh of Captaines , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men both free and bond , both small and great .
And I saw the beast , & the Kings of the earth , and their armies gathered together to make warre against him that sate on the horse , and against his armie .
And the beast was taken , & with him the false prophet , that wrought miracles before him , with which he deceiued them that had receiued the marke of the beast , and them that worshipped his image . These both were cast aliue into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
<NON-VERSE>
And I saw an Angel come down from heauen , hauing the key of the bottomles pit , & a great chaine in his hand .
And hee laid hold on the dragon that old serpent , which is the deuill and Satan , and bound him a thousand yeres ,
And cast him into the bottomlesse pit , and shut him vp , and set a seale vpon him , that he should deceiue the nations no more , till the thousand yeeres should bee fulfilled : and after that hee must be loosed a little season .
And I saw thrones , and they sate vpon them , and iudgement was giuen vnto them : & I saw the soules of them that were beheaded for the witnesse of Iesus , and for the word of God , and which had not worshipped the beast , neither his image , neither had receiued his marke vpon their foreheads , or in their hands ; and they liued and reigned with Christ a thousand yeeres .
But the rest of the dead liued not againe vntill the thousand yeeres were finished . This is the first resurrection .
Blessed & holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be Priests of God , and of Christ , and shall reigne with him a thousand yeeres .
And when the thousand yeeres are expired , Satan shall be loosed out of his prison ,
And shall goe out to deceiue the nations which are in the foure quarters of the earth , Gog & Magog , to gather them together to battell : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
And they went vp on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the campe of the Saints about , and the beloued citie : and fire came downe from God out of heauen , and deuoured them .
And the deuil that deceiued them , was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night , for euer and euer .
And I saw a great white throne , and him that sate on it , from whose face the earth and the heauen fled away , and there was found no place for them .
And I sawe the dead , small and great , stand before God : and the books were opened : & another booke was opened , which is the booke of life : and the dead were iudged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
And the sea gaue vp the dead which were in it : and death and hell deliuered vp the dead which were in them : and they were iudged euery man according to their works .
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire : this is the second death .
<NON-VERSE>
And I saw a new heauen , and a new earth : for the first heauen , and the first earth were passed away , and there was no more sea .
And I Iohn saw the holy City , new Hierusalem comming down from God out of heauen , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
And I heard a great voice out of heauen , saying , Behold , the Tabernacle of God is with men , and he wil dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himselfe shalbe with them , and be their God .
And God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes : and there shall bee no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there bee any more paine : for the former things are passed away .
And he that sate vpon the throne , said , Behold , I make all things new . And hee said vnto me , Write : for these words are true and faithfull .
And he said vnto mee , It is done : I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . I will giue vnto him that is athirst , of the fountaine of the water of life , freely .
He that ouercommeth , shall inherite all things , and I will bee his God , and he shall be my sonne .
But the fearefull , and vnbeleeuing , and the abominable , and murderers , and whore mongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all lyars , shall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death .
And there came vnto me one of the seuen Angels , which had the seuen vials full of the seuen last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the Bride , the Lambes wife .
And he caried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountaine , and shewed me that great citie , the holy Hierusalem , descending out of heauen from God ,
Hauing the glory of God : and her light was like vnto a stone most precious ; euen like a iasper stone , cleare as christal ,
And had a wall great and high , and had twelue gates , and at the gates twelue Angels , & names written thereon , which are the names of the twelue tribes of the children of Israel .
On the East three gates , on the North three gates , on the South three gates , and on the West three gates .
And the wall of the citie had twelue foundations , and in them the names of the twelue Apostles of the Lambe .
And hee that talked with mee , had a golden reede to measure the citie , and the gates thereof , and the wall thereof .
And the city lieth foure square , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelue thousand furlongs : the length , and the breadth , and the height of it are equall .
And he measured the wall thereof , an hundred , and fourtie , and foure cubites , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the Angel .
And the building of the wall of it was of Iasper , and the city was pure gold , like vnto cleare glasse .
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all maner of precious stones . The first foundation was Iasper , the second Saphir , the third a Chalcedony , the fourth an Emerald ,
The fift Sardonix , the sixt Sardius , the seuenth Chrysolite , the eight Beryl , the ninth a Topas , the tenth a Chrysoprasus , the eleuenth a Iacinct , the twelfth an Amethyst .
And the twelue gates were twelue pearles , euery seuerall gate was of one pearle , and the streete of the city was pure golde , as it were transparent glasse .
And I saw no Temple therein : For the Lord God Almightie , and the Lambe , are the Temple of it .
And the citie had no need of the Sunne , neither of the Moone to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the Lambe is the light thereof .
And the nations of them which are saued , shall walke in the light of it : and the kings of the earth doe bring their glory and honour into it .
And the gates of it shall not bee shut at all by day : for there shall bee no night there .
And they shall bring the glorie and honour of the nations into it .

And he shewed mee a pure riuer of water of life , cleere as Chrystall , proceeding out of the throne of God , and of the Lambe .
In the middest of the street of it , and of either side of the riuer , was there the tree of life , which bare twelue manner of fruits , and yeelded her fruit euery moneth : and the leaues of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
And there shall be no more curse , but the throne of God , & of the Lambe shall bee in it , and his seruants shall serue him .
And they shall see his face , and his Name shall be in their foreheads .
And there shalbe no night there , and they need no candle , neither light of the Sunne , for the Lord God giueth them light , and they shall reigne for euer and euer .
And hee said vnto mee , These sayings are faithfull and true . And the Lord God of the holy Prophets sent his Angel to shew vnto his seruants the things which must shortly be done .
Beholde , I come quickly : Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecie of this booke .
And I Iohn saw these things , and heard them . And when I had heard and seene , I fell downe , to worship before the feete of the Angel , which shewed me these things .
Then saith he vnto me , See thou doe it not : for I am thy fellow seruant , and of thy brethren the Prophets , and of them which keepe the sayings of this booke : worship God .
And hee saith vnto mee , Seale not the sayings of the prophesie of this booke : for the time is at hand .
He that is vniust , let him be vniust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and hee that is righteous , let him bee righteous still : and hee that is holy , let him be holy still .
And behold , I come quickly , and my reward is with mee , to giue euery man according as his worke shall be .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the first & the last .
Blessed are they that do his commandements , that they may haue right to the tree of life , and may enter in thorow the gates into the citie .
For without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoeuer loueth and maketh a lie .
I Iesus haue sent mine Angel , to testifie vnto you these things in the Churches . I am the roote and the offspring of Dauid , and the bright and morning starre .
And the Spirit and the Bride say , Come . And let him that heareth , say , Come . And let him that is a thirst , come . And whosoeuer will , let him take the water of life freely .
For I testifie vnto euery man that heareth the wordes of the prophesie of this booke , If any man shal adde vnto these things , God shall adde vnto him the plagues , that are written in this booke .
And if any man shall take away from the wordes of the booke of this prophesie , God shal take away his part out of the booke of life , and out of the holy citie , and from the things which are written in this booke .
Hee which testifieth these things , saith , Surely , I come quickly . Amen . Euen so , Come Lord Iesus .

Paul a seruant of Iesus Christ , called to bee an Apostle , separated vnto the Gospel of God ,
And declared to be the Sonne of God , with power , according to the Spirit of holinesse , by the resurrection from the dead .
By whom we haue receiued grace and Apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his Name ,
Among whom are ye also the called of Iesus Christ .
To all that be in Rome , beloued of God , called to be Saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Iesus Christ .
First I thanke my God through Iesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
For God is my witnesse , whom I serue with my spirit in the Gospel of his Sonne , that without ceasing I make mention of you , alwayes in my prayers ,
Making request , ( if by any meanes now at length I might haue a prosperous iourney by the will of God ) to come vnto you .
For I long to see you , that I may impart vnto you some spirituall gift , to the end you may be established ,
That is , that I may be comforted together with you , by the mutual faith both of you and me .
Now I would not haue you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come vnto you , ( but was let hitherto ) that I might haue some fruit among you also , euen as among other Gentiles .
I am debter both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians , both to the wise , and to the vnwise .
So , as much as in mee is , I am ready to preach the Gospel to you that are at Rome also .
For I am not ashamed of the Gopel of Christ : for it is the power of God vnto saluation , to euery one that beleeueth , to the Iew first , and also to the Greeke .
For therein is the righteousnesse of God reueiled from faith to faith : as it is written , The iust shall liue by faith .
For the wrath of God is reueiled from heauen against all vngodlinesse , and vnrighteousnesse of men , who hold the trueth in vnrighteousnesse .
Because that which may bee knowen of God , is manifest in them , for God hath shewed it vnto them .
For the inuisible things of him from the Creation of the world , are clearely seene , being vnderstood by the things that are made , euen his eternall Power and Godhead , so that they are without excuse :
Because that when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankefull , but became vaine in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened :
Professing themselues to be wise , they became fooles :
And changed the glory of the vncorruptible God , into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birdes , and foure footed beasts , and creeping things :
Wherefore God also gaue them vp to vncleannesse , through the lusts of their owne hearts , to dishonour their owne bodies betweene themselues :
Who changed the trueth of God into a lye , and worshipped and serued the creature more then the Creatour , who is blessed for euer . Amen .
For this cause God gaue them vp vnto vile affections : for euen their women did change the naturall vse into that which is against nature :
And likewise also the men , leauing the naturall vse of the woman , burned in their lust one towards another , men with men working that which is vnseemely , and receiuing in themselues that recompense of their errour which was meet .
And euen as they did not like to retaine God in their knowledge , God gaue them ouer to a reprobate minde , to doe those things which are not conuenient :
Being filled with all vnrighteousnes , fornication , wickednesse , couetousnes , maliciousnes , full of enuie , murther , debate , deceit , malignitie , whisperers ,
Backbiters , haters of God , despitefull , proude , boasters , inuenters of euill things , disobedient to parents ;
Without vnderstanding , couenant breakers , without naturall affection , implacable , vnmercifull ;

Therefore , thou art inexcusable , O man , whosoeuer thou art that iudgest : for wherein thou iudgest another , thou condemnest thy selfe , for thou that iudgest doest the same things . But wee are sure that the iudgement of God is according to trueth , against them which commit such things .
And thinkest thou this , O man , that iudgest them which doe such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the iudgement of God ?
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodnesse , and forbearance , and long suffering , not knowing that the goodnes of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
But after thy hardnesse , and impenitent heart , treasurest vp vnto thy selfe wrath , against the day of wrath , and reuelation of the righteous iudgement of God :
Who will render to euery man according to his deedes :
To them , who by patient continuance in well doing , seeke for glorie , and honour , and immortalitie , eternall life :
But vnto them that are contentious , & doe not obey the trueth , but obey vnrighteousnes , indignation , & wrath ,
Tribulation , and anguish vpon euery soule of man that doeth euill , of the Iew first , and also of the Gentile .
But glory , honour , and peace , to euery man that worketh good , to the Iew first , and also to the Gentile .
For there is no respect of persons with God .
For as many as haue sinned without Law , shall also perish without Law : and as many as haue sinned in the Law , shalbe iudged by the Law .
( For not the hearers of the Law are iust before God , but the doers of the Law shalbe iustified ;
For when the Gentiles which haue not the Law , doe by nature the things contained in the Law : these hauing not the Law , are a Law vnto themselues ,
Which shew the worke of the Law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witnesse , and their thoughts the meane while accusing , or else excusing one another :
In the day when God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ , according to my Gospel .
Behold , thou art called a Iew , and restest in the Law , and makest thy boast of God :
And knowest his will , and approuest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the Law ,
And art confident that thou thy selfe art a guide of the blinde , a light of them which are in darkenesse :
An instructour of the foolish , a teacher of babes : which hast the forme of knowledge and of the trueth in the Law :
Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thy selfe ? thou that preachest a man should not steale , doest thou steale ?
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adulterie , doest thou commit adulterie ? thou that abhorrest idols , doest thou commit sacriledge ?
Thou that makest thy boast of the Law , through breaking the Law dishonourest thou God ?
For the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles , through you , as it is written :
For Circumcision verily profiteth if thou keepe the Law : but if thou be a breaker of the Law , thy Circumcision is made vncircumcision .
What aduantage then hath the Iew ? or what profit is there of Circumcision ?
Much euery way : chiefly , because that vnto them were committed the Oracles of God .
But if our vnrighteousnesse commend the righteousnesse of God , what shall we say ? is God vnrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speake as a man )
God forbid : for then how shall God iudge the world ?
For if the trueth of God hath more abounded through my lye vnto his glory ; why yet am I also iudged as a sinner ?
And not rather as wee be slanderously reported , and as some affirme that we say , Let vs doe euill , that good may come : whose damnation is iust .
What then ? are wee better then they ? No in no wise : for we haue before proued both Iewes , and Gentiles , that they are all vnder sinne ,
As it is written , There is none righteous , no not one :
There is none that vnderstandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
They are all gone out of the way , they are together become vnprofitable , there is none that doeth good , no not one .
Their throat is an open sepulchre , with their tongues they haue vsed deceit , the poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes :
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitternesse : Their feet are swift to shed blood .
Destruction & misery are in their wayes : And the way of peace haue they not knowen .
There is no feare of God before their eyes .
Now we know that what things soeuer the Law saith , it saith to them who are vnder the Law : that euery mouth may bee stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
Therefore by the deedes of the Law , there shall no flesh be iustified in his sight : for by the Law is the knowledge of sinne .
But nowe the righteousnesse of God without the Lawe is manifested , being witnessed by the Lawe and the Prophets .
Euen the righteousnesse of God , which is by faith of Iesus Christ vnto all , and vpon all them that beleeue : for there is no difference :
For all haue sinned , and come short of the glory of God ,
Being iustified freely by his grace , through the redemption that is in Iesus Christ : Whom God hath set forth to bee a propitiation , through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes , that are past , through the forbearance of God .
To declare , I say , at this time his righteousnesse : that hee might bee iust , and the iustifier of him which beleeueth in Iesus .
Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what Law ? Of works ? Nay : but by the Law of faith .
Therefore wee conclude , that a man is iustified by faith , without the deeds of the Law .
Is he the God of the Iewes only ? Is he not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also :
Seeing it is one God which shal iustifie the circumcision by faith , and vncircumcision through faith .
<NON-VERSE> What shall we say then , that Abraham our father , as perteining to the flesh , hath found ?
For if Abraham were iustified by workes , hee hath whereof to glory , but not before God .
But to him that worketh not , but beleeueth on him that iustifieth the vngodly ; his faith is counted for righteousnesse .
Euen as Dauid also describeth the blessednesse of the man , vnto whom God imputeth righteousnesse without works :
Saying , Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiuen , and whose sinnes are couered .
Blessed is the man to whome the Lord will not impute sinne .
Commeth this blessednes then vpon the circumcision onely , or vpon the vncircumcision also ? for wee say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousnesse .
How was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in vncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in vncircumcision .
And hee receiued the signe of circumcision , a seale of the righteousnesse of the faith , which hee had yet being vncircumcised : that he might be the father of all them that beleeue , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousnesse might be imputed vnto them also :
And the father of circumcision , to them who are not of the circumcision onely , but also walke in the steppes of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet vncircumcised .
For the promise that he should be the heire of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed through the Lawe , but through the righteousnesse of faith .
For if they which are of the law be heires , faith is made voide , and the promise made of none effect .
Because the law worketh wrath : for where no Lawe is , there is no transgression .
Therefore it is of faith , that it might bee by grace ; to the ende the promise might be sure to all the seede , not to that onely which is of the Law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of vs all ,
( As it is written , I haue made thee a father of many nations ) before him whom he beleeued , euen God who quickeneth the dead , and calleth those things which bee not , as though they were ,
Who against hope , beleeued in hope , that hee might become the father of many nations : according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seede bee .
And being not weake in faith , hee considered not his owne body now dead , when hee was about an hundred yere old , neither yet the deadnes of Saraes wombe .
Hee staggered not at the promise of God through vnbeliefe : but was strong in faith , giuing glory to God :
And being fully perswaded , that what he had promised , he was able also to performe . And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousnesse .
Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him :
But for vs also , to whome it shall bee imputed , if wee beleeue on him that raised vp Iesus our Lord from the dead ,
<NON-VERSE>
Therefore being iustified by faith , wee haue peace with God , through our Lord Iesus Christ .
By whom also wee haue accesse by faith , into this grace wherein wee stand , and reioyce in hope of the glory of God .
And not onely so , but we glory in tribulations also , knowing that tribulation worketh patience :
And patience , experience : and experience , hope :
And hope maketh not ashamed , because the loue of God is shed abroad in our hearts , by the holy Ghost , which is giuen vnto vs .
For when wee were yet without strength , in due time , Christ died for the vngodly .
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peraduenture for a good man , some would euen dare to dye .
But God commendeth his loue towards vs , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for vs .
Much more then being now iustified by his blood , we shalbe saued from wrath through him .
For if when wee were enemies , we were reconciled to God , by the death of his sonne : much more being reconciled , we shalbe saued by his life .
And not onely so , but wee also ioy in God , through our Lorde Iesus Christ , by whom we haue now receiued the atonement .
Wherefore , as by one man sinne entred into the world , and death by sin : and so death passed vpon all men , for that all haue sinned .
For vntill the Law sinne was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no Law .
Neuertheles , death reigned from Adam to Moses , euen ouer them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come :
But not as the offence , so also is the free gift : for if through the offence of one , many bee dead : much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man Iesus Christ , hath abounded vnto many .
And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the iudgement was by one to condemnation : but the free gift is of many offences vnto iustification .
For if by one mans offence , death raigned by one , much more they which receiue abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousnes , shall reigne in life by one , Iesus Christ .
Therfore as by the offence of one , iudgment came vpon all men to condemnation : euen so by the righteousnes of one , the free gift came vpon all men vnto iustification of life .
For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners : so by the obedience of one , shall many bee made righteous .
Moreouer , the Lawe entred , that the offence might abound : but where sinne abounded , grace did much more abound .
<NON-VERSE>
What shall we say then ? shall wee continue in sinne : that grace may abound ?
God forbid : how shall wee that are dead to sinne , liue any longer therein ?
For if we haue bene planted together in the likenesse of his death : wee shalbe also in the likenesse of his resurrection :
Knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the bodie of sinne might bee destroyed , that hencefoorth we should not serue sinne .
For he that is dead , is freed from sinne .
Now if we be dead with Christ , we beleeue that we shal also liue with him :
Knowing that Christ being raysed from the dead , dieth no more , death hath no more dominion ouer him .
For in that he dyed , he dyed vnto sinne once : but in that hee liueth , hee liueth vnto God .
Likewise reckon yee also your selues to be dead indeed vnto sinne : but aliue vnto God , through Iesus Christ our Lord .
Let not sinne reigne therfore in your mortall body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
Neither yeeld yee your members as instruments of vnrighteousnes vnto sinne : but yeelde your selues vnto God , as those that are aliue from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousnesse vnto God .
For sinne shall not haue dominion ouer you , for yee are not vnder the Law , but vnder Grace .
What then ? shal we sinne , because wee are not vnder the Law , but vnder Grace ? God forbid .
Know ye not , that to whom yee yeeld your selues seruants to obey , his seruants ye are to whom ye obey : whether of sinne vnto death , or of obedience vnto righteousnesse ?
But God bee thanked , that yee were the seruants of sinne : but ye haue obeyed from the heart that fourme of doctrine , which was deliuered you .
Being then made free from sinne , yee became the seruants of righteousnesse .
I speake after the maner of men , because of the infirmitie of your flesh : for as yee haue yeelded your members seruants to vncleannesse and to iniquitie , vnto iniquitie : euen so now yeelde your members seruants to righteousnesse , vnto holinesse .
For when yee were the seruants of sinne ye were free from righteousnesse .
What fruit had yee then in those things , whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
But now being made free from sinne , and become seruants to God , yee haue your fruit vnto holinesse , and the end euerlasting life .
<NON-VERSE>
Know ye not , brethren ( for I speake to them that knowe the Lawe ) how that the Lawe hath dominion ouer a man , as long as he liueth ?
For the woman which hath an husbaud , is bound by the law to her husband , so long as he liueth : but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of the husband .
So then if while her husband liueth , shee be married to another man , shee shalbe called an adulteresse : but if her husband be dead , shee is free from that law , so that she is no adulteresse , though she be married to another man .
Wherefore my brethren , yee also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ , that ye should be married to another , euen to him who is raised from the dead , that wee should bring forth fruit vnto God ,
For when wee were in the flesh , the motions of sinnes which were by the law , did worke in our members , to bring foorth fruit vnto death .
But now wee are deliuered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held , that we should serue in newnesse of spirit , and not in the oldnesse of the letter .
What shall wee say then ? is the law sinne ? God forbid . Nay , I had not knowen sinne , but by the lawe : for I had not knowen lust , except the Law had said , Thou shalt not couet .
But sinne taking occasion by the commaundement , wrought in me all maner of concupiscence . For without the Law sinne was dead .
For I was aliue without the Law once , but when the commandement came , sinne reuiued , and I died .
And the commandement which was ordained to life , I found to be vnto death .
For sinne taking occasion by the commandement , deceiued me , and by it slew me .
Wherefore the Law is holy , and the Commandement holy , and iust , and good .
Was that then which is good , made death vnto me ? God forbid . But sinne , that it might appeare sinne , working death in mee by that which is good : that sinne by the Commaundement might become exceeding sinfull .
For wee know that the Law is spirituall : but I am carnall , sold vnder sinne .
For that which I do , I allow not : for what I would , that do I not , but what I hate , that doe I .
If then I doe that which I would not , I consent vnto the Law , that it is good .
Now then , it is no more I that doe it : but sinne that dwelleth in me .
For I know , that in me ( that is , in my flesh ) dwelleth no good thing . For to will is present with me : but how to performe that which is good , I find not . For the good that I would , I do not : but the euill which I would not , that I doe .
Now if I doe that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sinne that dwelleth in me .
I find then a Law , that when I would do good , euil is present with me .
For I delight in the Lawe of God , after the inward man .
But I see another Lawe in my members , warring against the Lawe of my minde , and bringing me into captiuity to the Law of sinne , which is in my members .
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus , who walke not after the flesh , but after the spirit .
For the law of the spirit of life , in Christ Iesus , hath made me free from the law of sinne and death .
For what the law could not doe , in that it was weake through the flesh , God sending his owne Sonne , in the likenesse of sinnefull flesh , and for sinne condemned sinne in the flesh :
That the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in vs , who walke not after the flesh , but after the spirit .
For they that are after the flesh , doe minde the things of the flesh : but they that are after the spirit , the things of the spirit .
For to be carnally minded , is death : but to be spiritually minded , is life and peace :
Because the carnall minde is enmitie against God : for it is not subiect to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
So then they that are in the flesh , cannot please God .
But ye are not in the flesh , but in the spirit , if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man haue not the spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
And if Christ in you , the body is dead because of sinne : but the spirit is life , because of righteousnesse .
But if the spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead , dwell in you : he that raised vp Christ from the dead , shall also quicken your mortall bodies , by his spirit that dwelleth in you .
Therfore brethren , we are detters , not to the flesh , to liue after the flesh .
For if ye liue after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body , ye shall liue .
For as many as are led by the spirit of God , they are the sonnes of God .
For ye haue not receiued the spirit of bondage againe to feare : but ye haue receiued the spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , father .
The spirit it selfe beareth witnes with our spirit , that we are the children of God .
And if children , then heires , heires of God , and ioynt heires with Christ : if so be that we suffer with him , that wee may be also glorified together .
For I reckon , that the sufferings of this present time , are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be reuealed in vs .
For the earnest expectation of the creature , waiteth for the manifestation of the sonnes of God .
For the creature was made subiect to vanitie , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subiected the same in hope :
Because the creature it selfe also shall bee deliuered from the bondage of corruption , into the glorious libertie of the children of God .
For wee know that the whole creation groaneth , and trauaileth in paine together vntill now .
But if wee hope for that wee see not , then doe wee with patience waite for it .
Likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what wee should pray for as wee ought : but the spirit it selfe maketh intercession for vs with groanings , which cannot bee vttered .
And he that searcheth the hearts , knoweth what is the minde of the spirit , because he maketh intercession for the Saints , according to the will of God .
And wee know that all things worke together for good , to them that loue God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
For whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his sonne , that hee might bee the first borne amongst many brethren .
Moreouer , whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also iustified : and whom he iustified , them he also glorified .
What shall wee then say to these things ? If God be for vs , who can bee against vs ?
He that spared not his owne son , but deliuered him vp for vs all : how shall hee not with him also freely giue vs all things ?
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect ? It is God that iustifieth :
Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather that is risen againe , who is euen at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for vs .
Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ ? shall tribulation , or distresse , or persecution , or famine , or nakednesse , or perill , or sword ?
( As it is written , for thy sake we are killed all the day long , wee are accounted as sheepe for the slaughter . )
Nay in all these things wee are more then conquerours , through him that loued vs .
For I am perswaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
<NON-VERSE>
I say the trueth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing mee witnesse in the holy Ghost ,
That I haue great heauinesse , and continuall sorrow in my heart .
For I could wish that my selfe were accursed from Christ , for my brethren my kinsemen according to the flesh :
Who are Israelites : to whom perteineth the adoption , and the glory , and the couenants , and the giuing of the Law , and the seruice of God , and the promises :
Whose are the fathers , and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came , who is ouer all , God blessed for euer , Amen .
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect . For they are not all Israel which are of Israel :
Neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children : but in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
That is , They which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
For this is the word of promise , At this time will I come , and Sara shall haue a sonne .
And not onely this , but when Rebecca also had conceiued by one , euen by our father Isaac , ( For the children being not yet borne , neither hauing done any good or euil , that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not of workes , but of him that calleth . )
It was said vnto her , The elder shall serue the yonger .
As it is written , Iacob haue I loued , but Esau haue I hated .
What shall we say then ? Is there vnrighteousnes with God ? God forbid .
For hee saith to Moses , I will haue mercy on whom I wil haue mercie , and I will haue compassion on whom I will haue compassion .
So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
For the Scripture saith vnto Pharaoh , Euen for this same purpose haue I raised thee vp , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my Name might bee declared throughout all the earth .
Therefore hath hee mercie on whom hee will haue mercy , and whom he will , he hardeneth .
Thou wilt say then vnto mee ; Why doeth he yet find fault ? For who hath resisted his will ?
Nay but O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
Hath not the potter power ouer the clay , of the same lumpe , to make one vessell vnto honour , and another vnto dishonour ?
What if God , willing to shew his wrath , & to make his power knowen , indured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction :
And that he might make knowen the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which hee had afore prepared vnto glorie ?
Euen vs whom hee hath called , not of the Iewes onely , but also of the Gentiles .
As he saith also in Osee , I will call them my people , which were not my people : and her , beloued , which was not beloued .
And it shall come to passe , that in the place where it was saide vnto them , Ye are not my people , there shall they bee called the children of the liuing God .
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shalbe saued .
For he will finish the worke , and cut it short in righteousnesse : because a short worke will the Lord make vpon the earth .
And as Esaias said before , Except the Lord of Sabboth had left vs a seed , we had bene as Sodoma , and bene made like vnto Gomorrha .
What shall wee say then ? That the Gentiles which followed not after righteousnesse , haue attained to righteousnesse , euen the righteousnesse which is of faith :
But Israel which followed after the Law of righteousnesse , hath not attained to the Law of righteousnes .
Wherefore ? because they sought it , not by faith , but as it were by the works of the Law : for they stumbled at that stumbling stone ,
<NON-VERSE>
Brethren , my hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel is , that they might be saued .
For I beare them record , that they haue a zeale of God , but not according to knowledge .
For they being ignorant of Gods righteousnesse , and going about to establish their owne righteousnesse , haue not submitted themselues vnto the righteousnesse of God .
For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnes to euery one that beleeueth .
For Moses describeth the righteousnesse which is of the Law , that the man which doeth those things shall liue by them .
But the righteousnesse which is of faith , speaketh on this wise : Say not in thine heart , Who shall ascend into heauen ? That is to bring Christ down from aboue .
Or , Who shall descend into the deepe ? That is to bring vp Christ againe from the dead .
But what saith it ? The word is nigh thee , euen in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that is the word of faith which we preach ,
That if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus , and shalt beleeue in thine heart , that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saued .
For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteousnesse , and with the mouth confession is made vnto saluation .
For the Scripture saith , Whosoeuer beleeueth on him , shall not bee ashamed .
For there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke : for the same Lord ouer all , is rich vnto all , that call vpon him .
For whosoeuer shall call vpon the Name of the Lord , shall be saued .
How then shall they call on him in whom they haue not beleeued ? and how shal they beleeue in him , of whom they haue not heard ? and how shall they heare without a Preacher ?
And how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written : How beautifull are the feete of them that preach the Gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
But they haue not all obeyed the Gospel . For Esaias saith , Lord , who hath beleeued our report ?
So then , faith commeth by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
But I say , haue they not heard ? yes verely , their sound went into all the earth , and their words vnto the ends of the world .
But I say , Did not Israel know ? First Moses saith , I will prouoke you to iealousie by them that are no people , & by a foolish nation I will anger you .
But Esaias is very bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not : I was made manifest vnto them , that asked not after me .
<NON-VERSE>
I say then , Hath God cast away his people ? God forbidde . For I also am an Israelite of the seede of Abraham , of the tribe of Beniamin .
God hath not cast away his people which hee foreknew . Wote yee not what the Scripture saieth of Elias ? how hee maketh intercession to God against Israel , saying ,
Lord , they haue killed thy Prophets , and digged downe thine Altars , and I am left alone , and they seeke my life .
But what saieth the answere of God vnto him ? I haue reserued to my selfe seuen thousand men , who haue not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
Euen so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
And if by grace , then is it no more of workes : otherwise grace is no more grace . But if it bee of workes , then is it no more grace , otherwise worke is no more worke .
What then ? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for , but the election hath obtained it , and the rest were blinded ,
According as it is written , God hath giuen them the spirit of slumber : eyes that they should not see , and eares that they should not heare vnto this day .
And Dauid sayth , Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumbling blocke , and a recompense vnto them .
Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow downe their backe alway .
I say then ; Haue they stumbled that they should fall ? God forbid . But rather through their fall , saluation is come vnto the Gentiles , for to prouoke them to ielousie .
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them , the riches of the Gentiles : how much more their fulnesse ?
For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world : what shal the receiuing of them be , but life from the dead ?
For if the first fruite bee holy , the lumpe is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
And if some of the branches bee broken off , and thou being a wilde oliue tree wert graffed in amongst them , and with them partakest of the roote and fatnesse of the Oliue tree :
Boast not against the branches : but if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
Thou wilt say then , The branches were broken off , that I might bee graffed in .
Well : because of vnbeliefe they were broken off , and thou standest by fayth . Be not high minded , but feare .
For if God spared not the natural branches , take heede least hee also spare not thee .
Beholde therefore the goodnesse and seueritie of God : on them which fell , seueritie ; but towards thee , goodnesse , if thou continue in his goodnesse : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
And they also , if they bide not still in vnbeliefe , shall be graffed in : for God is able to graffe them in againe .
For if thou wert cut out of the Oliue tree which is wilde by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good Oliue tree : how much more shall these which be the naturall branches , bee graffed into their owne Oliue tree ?
For I would not , brethren , that ye should bee ignorant of this mysterie ( least yee should bee wise in your owne conceits ) that blindnesse in part is happened to Israel , vntill the fulnes of the Gentiles be come in .
And so all Israel shall be saued , as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliuerer , and shall turne away vngodlinesse from Iacob .
For this is my couenant vnto them , when I shall take away their sinnes .
As concerning the Gospel , they are enemies for your sake : but as touching the election , they are beloued for the fathers sakes .
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
For as yee in times past haue not beleeued God , yet haue now obtained mercy through their vnbeliefe :
Euen so haue these also now not beleeued , that through your mercy they also may obtaine mercy .
For God hath concluded them all in vnbeliefe , that he might haue mercy vpon all .
O the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God ! how vnsearchable are his iudgements , and his wayes past finding out !
For who hath knowen the mind of the Lord , or who hath bene his counseller ?
Or who hath first giuen to him , and it shall bee recompensed vnto him againe ?
<NON-VERSE>
I beseech you therefore brethren , by the mercies of God , that yee present your bodies a liuing sacrifice , holy , acceptable vnto God , which is your reasonable seruice .
And bee not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renuing of your minde , that ye may proue what is that good , that acceptable and perfect will of God .
For I say , through the grace giuen vnto mee , to euery man that is among you , not to thinke of himselfe more highly then hee ought to thinke , but to thinke soberly , according as God hath dealt to euery man the measure of faith .
For as we haue many members in one body , and all members haue not the same office :
So we being many are one bodie in Christ , and euery one members one of another .
Hauing then gifts , differing according to the grace that is giuen to vs , whether prophecie , let vs prophecie according to the proportion of faith .
Or ministery , let vs wait , on our ministring : or hee that teacheth , on teaching :
Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giueth , let him doe it with simplicitie : hee that ruleth , with diligence : hee that sheweth mercy , with cheerefulnesse .
Let loue bee without dissimulation : abhorre that which is euill , cleaue to that which is good .
Bee kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly loue , in honour preferring one another .
Not slouthfull in busines : feruent in spirit , seruing the Lord .
Reioycing in hope , patient in tribulation , continuing instant in prayer .
Distributing to the necessitie of Saints ; giuen to hospitalitie .
Blesse them which persecute you , blesse , and curse not .
Reioyce with them that doe reioice , and weepe with them that weepe .
Be of the same mind one towards another . Minde not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . Bee not wise in your owne conceits .
Recompence to no man euill for euill . Prouide things honest in the sight of all men .
If it be possible , as much as lyeth in you , liue peaceably with all men .
Dearely beloued , auenge not your selues , but rather giue place vnto wrath : for it is written , Uengeance is mine , I will repay , saith the Lord .
Therefore if thine enemie hunger , feed him : if he thirst , giue him drink . For in so doing thou shalt heape coales of fire on his head .
<NON-VERSE>
Let euery soule bee subiect vnto the higher powers : For there is no power but of God . The powers that be , are ordeined of God .
Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist , shall receiue to themselues damnation .
For rulers are not a terrour to good works , but to the euill . Wilt thou then not bee afraide of the power ? doe that which is good , and thou shalt haue praise of the same .
For hee is the minister of God to thee for good : but if thou do that which is euill , be afraid : for he beareth not the sword in vaine : for he is the minister of God , a reuenger to execute wrath vpon him that doeth euill .
Wherfore ye must needs be subiect , not onely for wrath , but also for conscience sake .
For , for this cause pay you tribute also : for they are Gods ministers , attending continually vpon this very thing .
Render therfore to all their dues , tribute to whom tribute is due , custome to whome custome , feare to whome feare , honour to whom honour .
Owe no man any thing , but to loue one another : for hee that loueth another hath fulfilled the Law .
For this , Thou shalt not commit adulterie , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steale , Thou shalt not beare false witnesse , Thou shalt not couet : and if there be any other commandement , it is briefly comprehended in this saying , namely , Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe .
Loue worketh no ill to his neighbour , therefore loue is the fulfilling of the Law .
And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleepe : for now is our saluation neerer then when we beleeued .
The night is farre spent , the day is at hand : let vs therefore cast off the workes of darkenesse , and let vs put on the armour of light .
Let vs walke honestly as in the day , not in rioting and drunkennesse , not in chambring and wantonnes , not in strife and enuying .
<NON-VERSE>
Him that is weake in the faith receiue you , but not to doubtfull disputations .
For one beleeueth that he may eat all things : another who is weake , eateth herbes .
Let not him that eateth , despise him that eateth not : and let not him which eateth not , iudge him that eateth . For God hath receiued him .
Who art thou that iudgest an other mans seruant ? to his owne master he standeth or falleth ; Yea he shall bee holden vp : for God is able to make him stand .
One man esteemeth one day aboue another : another esteemeth euery day alike . Let euery man bee fully perswaded in his owne minde .
He that regardeth a day , regardeth it vnto the Lord ; and hee that regardeth not the day , to the Lord hee doeth not regard it . He that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for hee giueth God thankes : and hee that eateth not , to the Lord hee eateth not , and giueth God thankes .
For none of vs liueth to himselfe , and no man dieth to himselfe .
For whether we liue , we liue vnto the Lord : and whether wee die , we die vnto the Lord : whether wee liue therefore or die , we are the Lords .
For to this ende Christ both died , and rose , and reuiued , that hee might be Lord both of the dead and liuing .
But why doest thou iudge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? wee shall all stand before the Iudgement seat of Christ .
For it is written , As I liue , saith the Lord , euery knee shall bow to mee , and euery tongue shall confesse to God .
So then euery one of vs shall giue accompt of himselfe to God .
Let vs not therefore iudge one another any more : but iudge this rather , that no man put a stumbling blocke , or an occasion to fall in his brothers way .
I know , and am perswaded by the Lord Iesus , that there is nothing vncleane of it selfe : but to him that esteemeth any thing to bee vncleane , to him it is vncleane .
But if thy brother be grieued with thy meate : now walkest thou not charitably . Destroy not him with thy meat , for whom Christ died .
Let not then your good be euill spoken of .
For the kingdome of God is not meat and drinke ; but righteousnes , and peace , and ioy in the holy Ghost .
For hee that in these things serueth Christ , is acceptable to God , and approued of men .
Let vs therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edifie an other .
For meat , destroy not the worke of God : all things indeed are pure ; but it is euill for that man who eateth with offence .
It is good neither to eate flesh , nor to drinke wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weake .
Hast thou faith ? haue it to thy selfe before God . Happie is he that condemneth not himselfe in that thing which hee alloweth .
<NON-VERSE>
Wee then that are strong , ought to beare the infirmities of the weake , and not to please our selues .
Let euery one of vs please his neighbour for his good to edification .
For euen Christ pleased not himselfe , but as it is written , The reproches of them that reproched thee , fell on mee .
For whatsoeuer things were written aforetime , were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope .
Now the God of patience and consolation graunt you to be like minded one towards another , according to Christ Iesus :
That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God , euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ .
Wherfore receiue yee one another , as Christ also receiued vs , to the glory of God .
Now I say , that Iesus Christ was a Minister of the circumcision for the trueth of God , to confirme the promises made vnto the fathers :
And that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercie , as it is written , For this cause I will confesse to thee among the Gentiles , and sing vnto thy Name .
And againe he saith , Reioyce yee Gentiles with his people .
And againe , Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles , and laud him all ye people .
And againe Esaias saith , There shal be a roote of Iesse , and he that shal rise to raigne ouer the Gentiles , in him shall the Gentiles trust .
Nowe the God of hope fill you with all ioy and peace in beleeuing , that yee may abound in hope through the power of the holy Ghost .
And I my selfe also am perswaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodnesse , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
Neuerthelesse , brethren , I haue written the more boldly vnto you , in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is giuen to mee of God ,
That I should be the minister of Iesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministring the Gospel of God , that the offering vp of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the holy Ghost .
I haue therfore whereof I may glory through Iesus Christ , in those things which pertaine to God .
For I will not dare to speake of any of those things , which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deede ,
Through mighty signes and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God , so that from Hierusalem and round about vnto Illyricum , I haue fully preached the Gospel of Christ .
Yea , so haue I striued to preach the Gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build vpon another mans foundation :
But as it is written , To whom hee was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that haue not heard , shall vnderstand .
For which cause also I haue been much hindered from coming to you .
But now hauing no more place in these parts , and hauing a great desire these many yeeres to come vnto you :
Whensoeuer I take my iourney into Spaine , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my iourney , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company . But now I goe vnto Hierusalem , to minister vnto the Saints .
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia , to make a certaine contribution for the poore Saints which are at Hierusalem .
It hath pleased them verely , and their detters they are . For if the Gentiles haue bene made partakers of their spirituall things , their duetie is also to minister vnto them in carnall things .
When therefore I haue performed this , and hane sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spaine .
And I am sure that when I come vnto you , I shall come in the fulnes of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ .
Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Iesus Christs sake , and for the loue of the Spirit , that ye striue together with me , in your praiers to God for me ,
That I may bee deliuered from them that do not beleeue in Iudea , and that my seruice which I haue for Hierusalem , may bee accepted of the Saints :
That I may come vnto you with ioy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .

I commend vnto you Phebe our sister , which is a seruant of the Church which is at Cenchrea :

Now I beseech you , brethren , marke them which cause diuisions and offences , contrary to the doctrine which ye haue learned , and auoide them .
For they that are such , serue not our Lord Iesus Christ , but their owne belly , and by good wordes and faire speeches deceiue the hearts of the simple .
For your obedience is come abroad vnto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalfe : but yet I would haue you wise vnto that which is good , and simple concerning euill .
And the God of peace shal bruise Satan vnder your feete shortly . The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Timotheus my worke - fellow , and Lucius , and Iason , and Sosipater my kinsemen salute you .
I Tertius who wrote this Epistle , salute you in the Lord . Gaius mine hoste , and of the whole Church , saluteth you . Erastus the Chamberlaine of the citie saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my Gospel , and the preaching of Iesus Christ , according to the reuelation of the the mysterie , which was kept secret since the world began :
But now is made manifest , and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the commandement of the euerlasting God , made knowen to all nations for the obedience of faith ,

Nowe it came to passe in the dayes when the Iudges ruled , that there was a famine in the land : and a certaine man of Bethlehem Iudah , went to soiourne in the countrey of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sonnes .
And the name of the man was Elimelech , and the name of his wife , Naomi , and the name of his two sonnes , Mahlon , and Chilion , Ephrathites of Bethlehem Iudah : and they came into the countrey of Moab , and continued there .
And Elimelech Naomies husband died , and shee was left , and her two sonnes ;
And they tooke them wiues of the women of Moab : the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they dwelled there about ten yeeres .
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them , and the woman was left of her two sonnes , and her husband .
¶ Then shee arose with her daughters in law , that shee might returne from the countrey of Moab : for shee had heard in the countrey of Moab , how that the Lord had visited his people , in giuing them bread .
Wherefore she went foorth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her : and they went on the way to returne vnto the land of Iudah .
Aud Naomi said vnto her two daughters in law , Goe , returne each to her mothers house : the Lord deale kindly with you , as ye haue dealt with the dead , and with me .
The Lord graunt you , that you may finde rest each of you in the house of her husband . Then she kissed them , and they lift vp their voyce and wept .
And they said vnto her , Surely wee will returne with thee , vnto thy people .
And Naomi said , Turne againe , my daughters : why will you goe with mee ? Are there yet any moe sonnes in my wombe , that they may be your husbands ?
Turne againe , my daughters , go your way , for I am too old to haue an husband : if I should say , I haue hope , if I should haue a husband also to night , and should also beare sonnes :
Would ye tary for them till they were growen ? would ye stay for them from hauing husbands ? nay my daughters : for it grieueth me much for your sakes , that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me .
And they lift vp their voyce , and wept againe : and Orpah kissed her mother in law , but Ruth claue vnto her .
And she said , Behold , thy sister in law is gone backe vnto her people , and vnto her gods : returne thou after thy sister in law .
And Ruth said , Intreate mee not to leaue thee , or to returne from following after thee : for whither thou goest , I will goe ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God :
Where thou diest , wil I die , and there will I bee buried : the Lord doe so to me , and more also , if ought but death part thee and me .
When shee sawe that shee was stedfastly minded to goe with her , then shee left speaking vnto her .
¶ So they two went vntill they came to Bethlehem : And it came to passe when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the citie was mooued about them , and they said , Is this Naomi ?
And she said vnto them , Call me not Naomi ; call mee Mara : for the Almightie hath dealt very bitterly with me .
I went out full , and the Lord hath bought me home againe emptie : Why then call ye me Naomi , seeing the Lord hath testified against me , and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?

And Naomi had a kinseman of her husbands , a mighty man of wealth , of the familie of Elimelech , and his name was Boaz .
And Ruth the Moabitesse saide vnto Naomi , Let me now goe to the field , and gleane eares of corne after him , in whose sight I shall finde grace . And shee saide vnto her , Goe , my daughter .
And she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her happe was to light on a part of the fielde belonging vnto Boaz , who was of the kinred of Elimelech .
¶ And behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said vnto the reapers , The Lord bee with you ; and they answered him , The Lord blesse thee . Then said Boaz vnto his seruant , that was set ouer the reapers , Whose damosell is this ?
And the seruaunt that was set ouer the reapers , answered and said , It is the Moabitish damosell that came backe with Naomi out of the countrey of Moab :
And she said , I pray you , let mee gleane and gather after the reapers amongst the sheaues : so shee came , and hath continued euen from the morning vntill now , that she taried a little in the house .
Then said Boaz vnto Ruth , Hearest thou not , my daughter ? Goe not to gleane in another field , neither goe from hence , but abide here fast by my maidens .
Let thine eyes be on the field that they doe reape , and go thou after them : Haue I not charged the young men , that they shall not touch thee ? and when thou art athirst , goe vnto the vessels , and drinke of that which the yong men haue drawen .
Then she fel on her face , and bowed her selfe to the ground , and said vnto him , Why haue I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
And Boaz answered and said vnto her , It hath fully bene shewed me , all that thou hast done vnto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband : and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother , and the land of thy natiuitie , and art come vnto a people , which thou knewest not heretofore .
The Lord recompense thy worke , and a full reward be giuen thee of the Lord God of Israel , vnder whose wings thou art come to trust .
Then she said , Let me finde fauour in thy sight , my lord , for that thou hast comforted mee , and for that thou hast spoken friendly vnto thine handmaid , though I be not like vnto one of thy hand - maidens .
And Boaz sayde vnto her , At meale time come thou hither , and eate of the bread , and dip thy morsell in the vineger . And shee sate beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corne , and she did eate , and was sufficed , and left .
And when shee was risen vp to gleane , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , Let her gleane euen among the sheaues , & reproch her not .
And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her , and leaue them that she may gleane them , and rebuke her not .
So she gleaned in the field vntill euen , and beat out that she had gleaned : and it was about an Ephah of barley .
¶ And shee tooke it vp , and went into the citie : and her mother in lawe saw what shee had gleaned ; and shee brought foorth , and gaue to her that she had reserued , after she was sufficed .
And her mother in law said vnto her , Where hast thou gleaned to day ? and where wroughtest thou ? blessed be hee that did take knowledge of thee . And shee shewed her mother in lawe with whom shee had wrought , and said , The mans name with whom I wrought to day , is Boaz .
And Naomi said vnto her daughter in law , Blessed be he of the Lord , who hath not left off his kindnesse to the liuing and to the dead . And Naomi said vnto her , The man is neere of kin vnto vs , one of our next kinsemen .
And Ruth the Moabitesse said , He said vnto me also , Thou shalt keepe fast by my yong men , vntill they haue ended all my haruest .
And Naomi said vnto Ruth her daughter in law , It is good , my daughter , that thou goe out with his maidens , that they meete thee not in any other field .
<NON-VERSE>
Then Naomi her mother in law said vnto her , My daughter , shal I not seeke rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
And now is not Boaz of our kinred , with whose maidens thou wast ? Behold , he winnoweth barley to night in the threshing floore .
Wash thy selfe therefore , and annoint thee , and put thy raiment vpon thee , and get thee downe to the floore : but make not thy selfe knowen vnto the man , vntill hee shall haue done eating and drinking .
And it shall be when hee lieth downe , that thou shalt marke the place where hee shall lie , and thou shalt goe in , and vncouer his feete , and lay thee downe , and he will tell thee what thou shalt doe .
And shee said vnto her , All that thou sayest vnto me , I will doe .
¶ And she went downe vnto the floore , and did according to all that her mother in law bade her .
And when Boaz had eaten and drunke , and his heart was merrie , hee went to lie downe at the ende of the heape of corne : and she came softly , and vncouered his feet , and laid her downe .
¶ And it came to passe at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himselfe : and behold , a woman lay at his feete .
And hee said , Who art thou ? And she answered , I am Ruth thine handmaid : spread therefore thy skirt ouer thine handmaid , for thou art a neare kinseman .
And hee said , Blessed be thou of the Lord , my daughter : for thou hast shewed more kindnesse in the latter ende , then at the beginning , in as much as thou followedst not yong men , whether poore , or rich .
Tary this night , and it shall be in the morning , that if hee will performe vnto thee the part of a kinseman , well , let him doe the kinsemans part ; but if hee will not doe the part of a kinseman to thee , then will I doe the part of a kinseman to thee , as the Lord liueth : lie downe vntill the morning .
¶ And shee lay at his feete vntill the morning : and she rose vp before one could know another . And he said , Let it not be knowen , that a woman came into the floore .
Also he said , Bring the vaile that thou hast vpon thee , and holde it . And when she helde it , he measured sixe measures of barley , and laide it on her : and he went into the citie .
And when shee came to her mother in law , she said , Who art thou , my daughter ? and she tolde her all that the man had done to her .
And she said , These sixe measures of barley gaue he me , for he said to me , Go not emptie vnto thy mother in law .
And hee tooke ten men of the Elders of the citie , and said , Sit ye downe here . And they sate downe .
And he said vnto the kinseman : Naomi that is come againe out of the countrey of Moab , selleth a parcell of land , which was our brother Elimelechs .
And I thought to aduertise thee , saying , Buy it before the inhabitants , and before the Elders of my people . If thou wilt redeeme it , redeeme it , but if thou wilt not redeeme it , then tell mee , that I may know : for there is none to redeeme it , besides thee , and I am after thee . And he said , I will redeeme it .
Then said Boaz , What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi , thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitesse , the wife of the dead , to raise vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance .
¶ And the kinseman said , I cannot redeeme it for my selfe , lest I marre mine owne inheritance : redeeme thou my right to thy selfe , for I cannot redeeme it .
Now this was the maner in former time in Israel , concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirme all things : a man plucked off his shooe , and gaue it to his neighbour : and this was a testimonie in Israel . Therfore the kinseman said vnto Boaz , Buy it for thee : so he drew off his shooe .
¶ And Boaz saide vnto the Elders , and vnto all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs , and all that was Chilions , and Mahlons , of the hande of Naomi .
Moreouer , Ruth the Moabitesse , the wife of Mahlon , haue I purchased to be my wife , to raise vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren , and from the gate of his place : ye are witnesses this day .
And all the people that were in the gate , and the Elders said , Wee are witnesses : The Lord make the woman that is come into thine house , like Rachel and like Leah , which two did build the house of Israel : and do thou worthily in Ephratah , and bee famous in Bethlehem .
And let thy house be like the house of Pharez , ( whom Tamar bare vnto to Iudah ) of the seed which the Lord shall giue thee of this yong woman .
¶ So Boaz tooke Ruth , and she was his wife : and when he went in vnto her , the Lord gaue her conception , and she bare a sonne .
And the women said vnto Naomi , Blessed be the Lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinseman , that his name may bee famous in Israel :
And he shalbe vnto thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for thy daughter in law which loueth thee , which is better to thee then seuen sonnes , hath borne him .
And Naomi tooke the childe , and laid it in her bosome , and became nurse vnto it .
And the women her neighbours gaue it a name , saying , There is a sonne borne to Naomi , and they called his name Obed : hee is the father of Iesse the father of Dauid .
¶ Now these are the generations of Pharez : Pharez begate Hezron , And Hezron begate Ram , and Ram begate Amminadab ,
And Amminadab begate Nahshon , and Nahshon begate Salmon , And Salmon begate Boaz , and Boaz begate Obed ,

As a piece of a pomegranat are thy temples within thy lockes .
There are threescore Queenes , and fourescore concubines , and virgins without number .
My doue , my vndefiled is but one ; she is the only one of her mother , she is the choice one of her that bare her : The daughters sawe her , and blessed her ; yea the Queenes and the concubins , and they praysed her .
¶ Who is she that looketh forth as the morning , faire as the moone , cleare as the sunne , and terrible as an armie with banners ?
I went downe into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranats budded .
Or euer I was aware , my soule made me like the chariots of Amminadib .

Howe beautifull are thy feete with shooes , O princes daughter ! the ioynts of thy thighs are like iewels , the worke of the hands of a cunning workman .
Thy nauell is like a round goblet , which wanteth not licour : thy belly is like an heape of wheate , set about with lillies .
Thy two breasts are like two yong Roes that are twinnes .
Thy necke is as a towre of yuory : thine eyes like the fish pooles in Heshbon , by the gate of Bathrabbim : thy nose is as the towre of Lebanon , which looketh toward Damascus .
Thine head vpon thee is like Carmel , and the haire of thine head like purple , the king is held in the galleries .
How faire , and how pleasant art thou , O Loue , for delights !
This thy stature is like to a palme tree , and thy breasts to clusters of grapes .
I said , I will goe vp to the palme tree , I will take hold of the boughes thereof : now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine , and the smell of thy nose , like apples .
And the roofe of thy mouth like the best wine , for my beloued , that goeth downe sweetely , causing the lippes of those that are asleepe , to speake .
¶ I am my beloueds , and his desire is towards me .
Come , my beloued , let vs goe forth into the field : let vs lodge in the villages .
Let vs get vp earely to the vineyards , let vs see if the vine flourish , whether the tender grape appeare , and the pomegranates bud forth : there will I giue thee my loues .

O that thou wert as my brother that sucked the brests of my mother , when I should find thee without , I would kisse thee , yet I should not be despised .
I would leade thee , and bring thee into my mothers house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drinke of spiced wine , of the iuice of my pomegranate .
His left hand should be vnder my head , and his right hand should embrace me .
I charge you , O daughters of Ierusalem , that ye stirre not vp , nor awake my loue vntill he please .
( Who is this that commeth vp from the wildernesse , leaning vpon her beloued ? ) I raised thee vp vnder the apple tree : there thy mother brought thee forth , there she brought thee forth , that bare thee .
¶ Set mee as a seale vpon thine heart , as a seale vpon thine arme : for loue is strong as death , iealousie is cruel as the graue : the coales thereof are coales of fire , which hath a most vehement flame .
Many waters cannot quench loue , neither can the floods drowne it : if a man would giue all the substance of his house for loue , it would vtterly be contemned .
¶ We haue a litle sister , and shee hath no breasts : what shall we doe for our sister , in the day when she shall bee spoken for ?
If she be a wall , we will build vpon her a palace of siluer : and if she bee a dore , we will inclose her with boards of Cedar .
I am a wall , and my breasts like towers : then was I in his eyes as one that found fauour .
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon , hee let out the vineyard vnto keepers : euery one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of siluer .
My vineyard which is mine , is before me : thou ( O Solomon ) must haue a thousand , and those that keepe the fruit thereof , two hundred .
Thou that dwellest in the gardens , the companions hearken to thy voice : cause me to heare it .

Paul a seruant of God , and an Apostle of Iesus Christ , according to the Faith of Gods Elect , and the acknowledging of the trueth which is after godlinesse ,
In hope of eternall life , which God that cannot lie , promised before the world began :
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching , which is committed vnto mee according to the commandement of God our Sauiour :
To Titus mine owne Sonne after the common faith , Grace , mercie , and peace from God the Father , and the Lord Iesus Christ our Sauiour .
For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordaine Elders in euery citie , as I had appointed thee .
If any be blamelesse , the husband of one wife , hauing faithfull children , not accused of riot , or vnruly .
For a Bishop must be blameles , as the steward of God : not selfewilled , not soone angry , not giuen to wine , no striker , not giuen to filthie lucre ,
But a louer of hospitality , a louer of good men , sober , iust , holy , temperate ,
Holding fast the faithfull word , as hee hath beene taught , that he may bee able by sound doctrine , both to exhort and to conuince the gainsayers .
For there are many vnruly and vaine talkers and deceiuers , specially they of the circumcision :
Whose mouthes must be stopped , who subuert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthie lucres sake .
One of themselues , euen a Prophet of their owne , said : The Cretians are alway lyers , euill beasts , slow bellies .
This witnesse is true : wherefore rebuke them sharpely that they may be sound in the faith ;
Not giuing heede to Iewish fables , and commandements of men that turne from the trueth .
Unto the pure all things are pure , but vnto them that are defiled , and vnbeleeuing , is nothing pure : but euen their mind and conscience is defiled .
<NON-VERSE>
But speake thou the things which become sound doctrine :
That the aged men be sober , graue , temperate , sound in faith , in charitie , in patience .
The aged women likewise that they be in behauiour as becommeth holinesse , not false accusers , not giuen to much wine , teachers of good things ,
That they may teach the young women to bee sober , to loue their husbands , to loue their children ,
In all things shewing thy selfe a patterne of good workes : in doctrine shewing vncorruptnesse , grauity , sinceritie ,
Sound speech that cannot be condemned , that hee that is of the contrarie part , may bee ashamed , hauing no euill thing to say of you .
Exhort seruants to be obedient vnto their own masters , and to please them well in all things , not answering againe :
Not purloyning , but shewing all good fidelitie , that they may adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things .
For the grace of God that bringeth saluation , hath appeared to all men ,
Teaching vs that denying vngodlinesse and worldly lusts we should liue soberly , righteously and godly in this present world ,
Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God , and our Sauiour Iesus Christ ,
Who gaue himselfe for vs , that he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie , and purifie vnto himselfe a peculiar people , zealous of good workes .
<NON-VERSE>
Put them in minde to bee subiect to Principalities & Powers , to obey magistrates , to be ready to euery good worke ,
To speake euill of no man , to bee no brawlers , but gentle , shewing all meekenesse vnto all men .
For we our selues also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceiued , seruing diuers lusts and pleasures , liuing in malice and enuy , hatefull , and hating one another .
But after that the kindnesse and loue of God our Sauiour toward man appeared ,
Not by workes of righteousnesse which wee haue done , but according to his mercy he saued vs , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the holy Ghost ,
Which hee shed on vs abundantly , through Iesus Christ our Sauiour :
That being iustified by his grace , we should bee made heires according to the hope of eternall life .
This is a faithfull saying , and these things I will that thou affirme constantly , that they which haue beleeued in God , might be carefull to maintaine good works : these things are good and profitable vnto men .
But auoyd foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and striuings about the lawe ; for they are vnprofitable and vaine .
A man that is an heretike , after the first and second admonition , reiect :
Knowing that hee that is such , is subuerted , and sinneth , being condemned of himselfe .
When I shall send Artemas vnto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come vnto mee to Nicopolis : for I haue determined there to winter .
Bring Zenas the Lawyer , and Apollos , on their iourney diligently , that nothing be wanting vnto them .
And let ours also learne to maintaine good workes for necessarie vses , that they be not vnfruitfull .

In the eight moneth , in the seconde yeere of Darius , came the word of the Lord vnto Zechariah , the sonne of Barachiah , the sonne of Iddo the Prophet , saying ,
The Lord hath bene sore displeased with your fathers .
Therefore say thou vnto them , Thus saith the Lord of hostes ; Turne ye vnto me , saith the Lord of hostes , and I will turne vnto you , saith the Lord of hostes .
Be ye not as your fathers , vnto whom the former Prophets haue cried , saying , Thus saith the Lord of hostes , Turne ye now from your euill wayes , and from your euil doings : but they did not heare , nor hearken vnto me , saith the Lord .
Your fathers , where are they ? and the Prophets , doe they liue for euer ?
But my words and my statutes , which I commanded my seruants the Prophets , did they not take holde of your fathers ? and they returned and saide ; Like as the Lord of hostes thought to doe vnto vs , according to our wayes , and according to our doings , so hath he dealt with vs .
¶ Upon the foure and twentieth day of the eleuenth moneth , which is the moneth Sebat , in the second yere of Darius , came the word of the Lord vnto Zechariah , the sonne of Barachiah , the sonne of Iddo the Prophet , saying :
I saw by night , and behold a man riding vpon a red horse , and he stood among the mirtle trees that were in the bottome , and behinde him were there red horses , speckled and white .
Then said I , O my Lord , what are these ? And the Angel that talked with me , said vnto me , I wil shew thee what these be .
And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered , and said , These are they , whom the Lord hath sent to walke to and fro through the earth .
And they answered the Angel of the Lord that stood among the mirtle trees , and said , Wee haue walked to and fro through the earth : and behold , all the earth sitteth still , and is at rest .
¶ Then the Angel of the Lord answered , and said , O Lord of hosts , how long wilt thou not haue mercie on Ierusalem , and on the cities of Iudah , against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten yeeres ?
And the Lord answered the Angel that talked with me , with good words , and comfortable words .
So the Angel that communed with me , said vnto me ; Cry thou , saying ; Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I am iealous for Ierusalem , and for Zion , with a great iealousie .
And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease : for I was but a little displeased , and they helped forward the affliction .
Therefore thus saith the Lord , I am returned to Ierusalem with mercies : my house shall bee built in it , saith the Lord of hostes , and a line shalbe stretched forth vpon Ierusalem .
Cry yet , saying , Thus saith the Lord of hostes , My cities through prosperitie shall yet be spread abroad , and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion , and shall yet choose Ierusalem .
¶ Then lift I vp mine eyes , and saw , and behold foure hornes .
And I said vnto the Angel that talked with me ; What be these ? and he answered mee , These are the hornes which haue scattered Iudah , Israel , and Ierusalem .
And the Lord shewed mee foure carpenters .
<NON-VERSE>
I lift vp mine eyes againe , and looked , and behold , a man with a measuring line in his hand .
Then said I , Whither goest thou ? And hee said vnto me , To measure Ierusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
And behold , the Angel that talked with me , went foorth , and another Angel went out to meete him :
And said vnto him , Run , speake to this young man , saying ; Ierusalem shall be inhabited as townes without walles , for the multitude of men and cattell therein .
For I , saith the Lord , will be vnto her a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of her .
¶ Ho , ho , come foorth , and flee from the land of the North , saith the Lord : for I haue spread you abroad as the foure windes of the heauen , sayth the Lord .
Deliuer thy selfe , O Zion , that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon .
For thus sayth the Lord of hostes , After the glory hath he sent me vnto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you , toucheth the apple of his eye .
For behold , I will shake mine hand vpon them , and they shall bee a spoile to their seruants : and yee shall know that the Lord of hostes hath sent me .
¶ Sing and reioyce , O daughter of Zion : for loe , I come , and I will dwell in the middest of thee , sayth the Lord .
And many nations shalbe ioyned to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwel in the middest of thee , and thou shalt know that the Lord of hostes hath sent me vnto thee .
And the Lord shall inherite Iudah his portion in the holy land , and shall choose Ierusalem againe .

And he shewed me Ioshua the high Priest , standing before the Angel of the Lord , and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him .
And the Lord said vnto Satan ; The Lord rebuke thee , O Satan , euen the Lord that hath chosen Ierusalem rebuke thee . Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire ?
Now Ioshua was clothed with filthie garments , and stood before the Angel .
And he answered , and spake vnto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the filthie garments from him . And vnto him he said , Behold , I haue caused thine iniquity to passe from thee , and I wil clothe thee with change of raiment . And I said , Let them set a faire mitre vpon his head . So they set a faire mitre vpon his head , and clothed him with garments , and the Angel of the Lord stood by .
And the Angel of the Lord protested vnto Ioshua , saying ;
Thus sayth the Lord of hosts , If thou wilt walke in my wayes , and if thou wilt keepe my charge , then thou shalt also iudge my House , and shalt also keepe my Courts , and I will giue thee places to walke among these that stand by .
Heare now , O Ioshua the high Priest , thou and thy fellowes that sit before thee : for they are men wondred at : for behold , I will bring foorth my seruant the Branch .
For behold the stone that I haue layd before Ioshua : vpon one stone shall be seuen eyes , behold , I will engraue the grauing thereof , saith the Lord of hostes , and I will remoue the iniquitie of that land in one day .
<NON-VERSE>
And the Angell that talked with me , came againe and waked me , as a man that is wakened out of his sleepe :
And said vnto mee , What seest thou ? and I said , I haue looked , and behold a candlesticke all of gold , with a bowle vpon the top of it , and his seuen lampes thereon , and seuen pipes to the seuen lampes , which were vpon the top thereof .
And two Oliue trees by it , one vpon the right side of the bowle , and the other vpon the left side thereof . So I answered and spake to the Angell that talked with mee , saying : What are these , my Lord ?
Then the Angel that talked with me , answered and said vnto me ; Knowest thou not what these be ? and I said ; No , my Lord .
Then hee answered and spake vnto mee , saying ; This is the word of the Lord vnto Zerubbabel , saying ; Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the Lord of hostes .
Who art thou , O great mountaine ? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plaine , and he shall bring forth the head stone thereof with shoutings , crying ; Grace , grace vnto it .
Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ;
The hands of Zerubbabel haue layed the foundation of this house : his hands shall also finish it , and thou shalt know that the Lord of hostes hath sent me vnto you .
For who hath despised the day of small things ? for they shall reioyce and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seuen : they are the eyes of the Lord , which run to and fro through the whole earth .
¶ Then answered I , and said vnto him ; What are these two oliue trees vpon the right side of the candlesticke , and vpon the left side thereof ?
And I answered againe and said vnto him , What be these two oliue branches , which through the two golden pipes emptie the golden oyle out of themselues ?
And hee answered mee and said ; Knowest thou not what these be ? and I said , No , my Lord .
<NON-VERSE>
Then I turned , and lift vp mine eyes , and looked , and behold , a flying roule .
And hee said vnto mee , What seest thou ? and I answered , I see a flying roule , the length thereof is twentie cubites , and the breadth thereof tenne cubites .
Then said hee vnto mee ; This is the curse , that goeth forth ouer the face of the whole earth : for euery one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side , according to it ; and euery one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side , according to it .
I will bring it forth , saith the Lord of hostes , and it shall enter into the house of the theefe , and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name : and it shall remaine in the midst of his house , and shall consume it , with the timber thereof , and the stones thereof .
¶ Then the Angell that talked with me , went forth and said vnto me , Lift vp now thine eyes , and see what is this that goeth forth .
And I said , What is it ? and hee said , This is an Ephah that goeth forth . Hee said moreouer , This is their resemblance through all the earth .
And behold , there was lift vp a talent of lead : and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the Ephah .
And he said , This is wickednesse , and he cast it into the midst of the Ephah , and he cast the weight of lead vpon the mouth thereof .
Then lift I vp mine eyes , and looked , & behold , there came out two women , and the winde was in their wings ( for they had wings like the wings of a storke ) and they lift vp the Ephah betweene the earth and the heauen .
Then saide I to the Angel that talked with me , Whither do these beare the Ephah ?
<NON-VERSE>
And I turned , and lift vp mine eyes , and looked , and beholde , there came foure charets out from betweene two mountaines , and the mountaines were mountaines of brasse .
In the first charet were red horses , and in the second charet , blacke horses .
And in the third charet white horses , and in the fourth charet grisled and bay horses .
Then I answered , and said vnto the Angel that talked with mee , What are these , my Lord ?
And the Angel answered and said vnto me , These are the foure spirits of the heauens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
The blacke horses which are therin , goe forth into the North countrey , and the white goe forth after them , and the grisled goe forth toward the South countrey .
And the baye went foorth , and sought to goe , that they might walke to and fro through the earth : and he said , Get ye hence , walke to and fro through the earth . So they walked to and fro through the earth .
Then cried he vpon me , and spake vnto me , saying , Behold , these that goe toward the North countrey , haue quieted my spirit , in the North countrey .
¶ And the word of the Lord came vnto me , saying ,
Take of them of the captiuitie , euen of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Iedaiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Iosiah the son of Zephaniah .
Then take siluer , and golde , and make crownes , and set them vpon the head of Ioshua the sonne of Iosedech , the high priest .
And speake vnto him , saying , Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes , saying , Behold , the man whose name is the Branch , and he shall growe vp out of his place , and he shall build the Temple of the Lord :
Euen he shall build the temple of the Lord , and he shal beare the glory , and shall sit and rule vpon his throne , and he shall be a priest vpon his throne , and the counsell of peace shall bee betweene them both .
And the crownes shall bee to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Iedaiah , and to Hen the sonne of Zephaniah for a memoriall , in the Temple of the Lord .

And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of King Darius , that the word of the Lord came vnto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth moneth , euen in Chisleu .
When they had sent vnto the house of God , Sherezer and Regem - melech , and their men to pray before the Lord ,
And to speake vnto the priestes , which were in the house of the Lord of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , Should I weepe in the fift moneth , separating my selfe , as I haue done these so many yeeres ?
¶ Then came the word of the Lord of hosts vnto me , saying ,
Speake vnto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fift and seuenth moneth , euen those seuenty yeeres ; did ye at all fast vnto me , euen to me ?
And when ye did eat , and when ye did drinke , did not ye eat for your selues , and drinke for your selues ?
Should yee not heare the wordes , which the Lord hath cried by the former Prophets , when Ierusalem was inhabited , and in prosperitie , and the cities thereof round about her , when men inhabited the South of the plaine ?
¶ And the word of the Lord came vnto Zechariah , saying ;
Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes , saying , Execute true iudgement , and shew mercie and compassions euery man to his brother .
And oppresse not the widow , nor the fatherlesse , the stranger , nor the poore , and let none of you imagine euill against his brother in your heart .
But they refused to hearken , and pulled away the shoulder , and stopped their eares , that they should not heare .
Yea , they made their hearts as an adamant stone , lest they should heare the Law , and the wordes which the Lord of hostes hath sent in his spirit by the former Prophets : therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hostes .
Therefore it is come to passe , that as he cried , and they would not heare , so they cried , and I would not heare , saith the Lord of hostes .
<NON-VERSE>
Againe the word of the Lord of hostes came to me , saying ;
Thus sayeth the Lord of hostes , I was iealous for Zion , with great iealousie ; and I was iealous for her with great furie .
Thus saith the Lord , I am returned vnto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Ierusalem , and Ierusalem shall be called a Citie of trueth , and the Mountaine of the Lord of hostes , the holy Mountaine .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; There shall yet old men , and old women , dwell in the streets of Ierusalem , and euery man with his staffe in his hand for very age .
And the streets of the citie shall be full of boyes and girles playing in the streets thereof .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , If it bee marueilous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these dayes , should it also bee marueilous in my eyes , saith the Lord of hostes ?
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Beholde , I will saue my people from the East countrey , and from the West countrey .
And I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Ierusalem , and they shalbe my people , and I will bee their God , in Trueth and in Righteousnesse .
¶ Thus saith the Lord of hostes , Let your handes be strong , ye that heare in these dayes , these wordes by the mouth of the Prophets , which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laied , that the Temple might be built .
For before these daies there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast , neither was there any peace to him that went out , or came in , because of the affliction : for I set all men , euery one against his neighbour .
But now I will not bee vnto the residue of this people , as in the former daies , saith the Lord of hostes .
For the seed shalbe prosperous : the Uine shall giue her fruit , and the ground shall giue her increase , and the heauens shall giue their dew , and I will cause the remnant of this people to possesse all these things .
And it shall come to passe , that as yee were a curse among the heathen , O house of Iudah , and house of Israel ; so will I saue you , and ye shalbe a blessing : feare not , but let your handes bee strong .
For thus saith the Lord of hostes , As I thought to punish you , when your fathers prouoked mee to wrath , saith the Lord of hostes , and I repented not :
So againe haue I thought in these dayes to doe well vnto Ierusalem , and to the house of Iudah : feare ye not .
¶ These are the things that yee shall doe ; Speake yee euery man the truth to his neighbor : execute the iudgment of trueth and peace in your gates .
And let none of you imagine euill in your hearts against his neighbour , and loue no false oath : for all these are things that I hate , saith the Lord .
¶ And the word of the Lord of hostes came vnto me , saying ,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; The fast of the fourth moneth , and the fast of the fift , and the fast of the seuenth , and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Iudah ioy and gladnesse , and cheerefull feasts : therefore loue the trueth and peace .
Thus saith the Lord of hosts , It shall yet come to passe , that there shall come people , and the inhabitants of many cities .
And the inhabitants of one citie shall goe to another , saying , Let vs goe speedily to pray before the Lord , and to seeke the Lord of hostes : I will goe also .
Yea many people and strong nations shall come to seeke the Lord of hostes in Ierusalem , and to pray before the Lord .

And Hamath also shall border thereby ; Tyrus and Zidon , though it be very wise .
And Tyrus did builde her selfe a strong hold , and heaped vp siluer as the dust , and fine golde as the myre of the streets .
Behold , the Lord wil cast her out , and he will smite her power in the sea , and she shalbe deuoured with fire .
Ashkelon shall see it , and feare , Gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowfull , and Ekron : for her expectation shalbe ashamed , and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shal not be inhabited .
And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
And I wil take away his blood out of his mouth , and his abominations from betweene his teeth : but he that remaineth , euen hee shalbe for our God , and he shall be as a gouernour in Iudah , and Ekron as a Iebusite .
And I will encampe about mine house because of the armie , because of him that passeth by , and because of him that returneth : and no oppressour shall passe through them any more : for now haue I seene with mine eyes .

As for thee also , by the blood of thy Couenant , I haue sent foorth thy prisoners out of the pit , wherein is no water .
¶ Turne ye to the strong hold , ye prisoners of hope , euen to day doe I declare that I will render double vnto thee :
When I haue bent Iudah for me , filled the bow with Ephraim , and raised vp thy sonnes O Zion , against thy sonnes , O Greece , and made thee as the sword of a mightie man .
And the Lord shalbe seene ouer them , and his arrow shall goe forth as the lightning : and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet , and shall goe with whirlewinds of the South .
The Lord of hostes shall defend them , and they shall deuoure , and subdue with sling stones , and they shal drinke and make a noise , as through wine , and they shall bee filled like bowles , and as the corners of the Altar .
And the Lord their God shall saue them in that day as the flock of his people , for they shall be as the stones of a crowne lifted vp as an ensigne vpon his land .

For the idoles haue spoken vanitie , and the diuiners haue seene a lye , and haue told false dreames ; they comfort in vaine : therefore they went their way as a flocke , they were troubled because there was no shepheard .
Mine anger was kindled against the shepheards , and I punished the goats : for the Lord of hostes hath visited his flocke the house of Iudah , and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battell .
Out of him came forth the corner , out of him the naile , out of him the battell bow , out of him euery oppressour together .
¶ And they shall bee as mightie men which tread downe their enemies in the myre of the streets in the battell , and they shall fight because the Lord is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
And I will strengthen the house of Iudah , and I will saue the house of Ioseph , and I will bring them againe to place them , for I haue mercie vpon them : and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am the Lord their God , & will heare them .
And they of Ephraim shall be like a mightie man , and their heart shall reioyce as through wine : yea , their children shall see it , and be glad , their heart shall reioyce in the Lord .
I will hisse for them and gather them , for I haue redeemed them : and they shall increase as they haue increased .
And I will sow them among the people , and they shall remember me in farre countries , and they shall liue with their children , and turne againe .
I will bring them againe also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria , and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon , and place shall not be found for them .
And he shall passe through the sea with affliction , & shall smite the waues in the Sea , and all the deepes of the riuer shall dry vp : and the pride of Assyria shall be brought downe , and the scepter of Egypt shall depart away .

Whose possessours slay them , and hold themselues not guiltie : and they that sell them say , Blessed be the Lord ; for I am rich : and their owne shepheards pitie them not .
For I will no more pitie the inhabitants of the land , saith the Lord : but loe , I will deliuer the men euery one into his neighbours hand , and into the hand of his King , and they shall smite the land , and out of their hand I will not deliuer them .
And I will feede the flocke of slaughter , euen you , O poore of the flock : and I tooke vnto me two staues ; the one I called Beautie , and the other I called Bandes , and I fed the flocke .
Three shepheards also I cut off in one moneth , and my soule loathed them , and their soule also abhorred mee .
Then said I , I will not feede you : that that dieth , let it die : and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off , and let the rest eate , euery one the flesh of another .
¶ And I tooke my staffe , euen Beautie , and cut it asunder , that I might breake my couenant which I had made with all the people .
And it was broken in that day : and so the poore of the flocke that waited vpon me , knew that it was the word of the Lord .
And I said vnto them , If yee thinke good , giue me my price : and if not , forbeare : so they weighed for my price thirtie pieces of siluer .
And the Lord said vnto mee , Cast it vnto the potter : a goodly price , that I was prised at of them . And I tooke the thirtie pieces of siluer , and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord .
Then I cut asunder mine other staffe , euen Bands , that I might break the brotherhood betweene Iudah and Israel .
¶ And the Lord said vnto me , Take vnto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepheard .
For loe , I wil raise vp a shepherd in the land , which shall not visit those that bee cut off , neither shall seeke the yong one , nor heale that that is broken , nor feed that that standeth still : but he shal eate the flesh of the fat , and teare their clawes in pieces .

The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel , saith the Lord , which stretcheth foorth the Heauens , and laith the foundation of the earth , and formeth the spirit of man within him .
Behold , I will make Ierusalem a cup of trembling vnto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Iudah and against Ierusalem .
¶ And in that day will I make Ierusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselues with it , shall be cut in pieces ; though all the people of the earth bee gathered together against it .
In that day , saith the Lord , I will smite euery horse with astonishment , and his rider with madnesse , and I will open mine eyes vpon the house of Iudah , and will smite euery horse of the people with blindnesse .
And the gouernours of Iudah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Ierusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hostes their God .
¶ In that day will I make the gouernours of Iudah like a harth of fire among the wood , and like a torch of fire in a sheafe ; and they shall deuoure all the people round about , on the right hand and on the left : and Ierusalem shall bee inhabited againe in her owne place , euen in Ierusalem .
The Lord also shall saue the tents of Iudah first , that the glory of the house of Dauid , and the glory of the inhabitants of Ierusalem do not magnifie themselues against Iudah .
In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Ierusalem , and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as Dauid ; and the house of Dauid shall be as God , as the Angel of the Lord before them .
¶ And it shall come to passe in that day , that I will seeke to destroy all the nations that come against Ierusalem .
And I wil powre vpon the house of Dauid , and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications , and they shall looke vpon me whom they haue pearced , and they shal mourne for him , as one mourneth for his onely sonne , and shall be in bitternesse for him , as one that is in bitternesse for his first borne . In that day shall there bee a great mourning in Ierusalem , as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
And the land shal mourne , euery familie apart , the familie of the house of Dauid apart , and their wiues apart , the familie of the house of Nathan apart , and their wiues apart : The familie of the house of Leui apart , and their wiues apart : the familie of Shimei apart , and their wiues apart :

And it shal come to passe that when any shall yet prophecie , then his father and his mother that begate him , shall say vnto him , Thou shalt not liue : for thou speakest lies in the Name of the Lord : and his father and his mother , that begate him , shall thrust him through when he prophecieth .
And it shall come to passe in that day , that the prophets shalbe ashamed euery one of his vision , when hee hath prophecied : neither shall they weare a rough garment to deceiue .
But he shal say , I am no prophet , I am an husbandman : for man taught me to keepe cattell from my youth .
And one shal say vnto him , What are these wounds in thine hands ? Then hee shall answere : Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
¶ Awake , O sword , against my shepheard , and against the man that is my fellow , saith the Lord of hostes : smite the Shepheard , and the sheepe shalbe scattered : and I wil turne mine hand vpon the litle ones .

For I wil gather all nations against Ierusalem to battell , and the citie shall be taken , & the houses rifeled , and the women rauished , and halfe of the citie shall goe forth into captiuitie , and the residue of the people shal not be cut off from the citie .
Then shall the Lord goe forth and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battel .
¶ And his feet shall stand in that day vpon the mount of Oliues , which is before Ierusalem on the East , and the mount of Oliues shall cleaue in the midst thereof toward the East , and toward the West , and there shall bee a very great valley , and halfe of the Mountaine shall remoue toward the North , and halfe of it toward the South .
And ye shal flee to the valley of the mountaines : for the valley of the mountaines shal reach vnto Azal : yea , ye shall flee like as yee fled from before the earthquake in the dayes of Uzziah king of Iudah : and the Lord my God shall come , and all the Saints with thee .

All the land shall be turned as a plaine from Geba to Rimmon , South of Ierusalem : and it shall be lifted vp and inhabited in her place : from Beniamins gate vnto the place of the first gate , vnto the corner gate , and from the towre of Hananiel vnto the Kings winepresses .
And men shall dwell in it , and there shalbe no more vtter destruction : but Ierusalem shalbe safely inhabited . ¶ And this shall be the plague , wherewith the Lord will smite all the people , that haue fought against Ierusalem : their flesh shall consume away , while they stand vpon their feete , and their eyes shall consume away in their holes , and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth .
And it shall come to passe in that day , that a great tumult from the Lord shalbe among them , and they shall lay holde euery one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise vp against the hand of his neighbour .

And so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camell , and of the asse , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
And if the family of Egypt goe not vp , and come not , that haue no raine : there shall bee the plague wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not vp to keepe the feast of Tabernacles .
This shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not vp to keepe the feast of Tabernacles .
¶ In that day shall there be vpon the bels of the horses , Holines Unto The Lord , and the pots in the Lords house shall bee like the bowles before the Altar .

And them that are turned backe from the Lord , & those that haue not sought the Lord , nor enquired for him .
Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice : he hath bid his ghests .

Therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation : they shall also build houses , but not inhabite them , and they shall plant Uineyards , but not drinke the wine thereof .
The great day of the Lord is neere , it is neere , and hasteth greatly , euen the voice of the day of the Lord : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
That day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distresse , a day of wastenesse and desolation , a day of darknesse and gloominesse , a day of cloudes and thicke darkenesse ;
A day of the trumpet and alarme against the fenced cities , and against the high towres .

Woe to her that is filthie and polluted , to the oppressing citie .
She obeyed not the voice : she receiued not correction : she trusted not in the Lord : she drew not neere to her God .
